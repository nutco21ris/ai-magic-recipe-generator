ombs !Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker .Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs ?Cho was looking from Harry to Filch also frowning the barn owl on her arm tired of standing on one leg gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it .I have my sources said Filch in a selfsatisfied hiss .Now hand over whatever it is youre sending .Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter Harry said I cant its gone .Gone ?said Filch his face contorting with rage .Gone said Harry calmly .Filch opened his mouth furiously mouthed for a few seconds then raked Harrys robes with his eyes .How do I know you havent got it in your pocket ?Because I saw him send it said Cho angrily .Filch rounded on her .You saw him ?Thats right I saw him she said fiercely .There was a moments pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward the door .He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry .If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb .He stumped off down the stairs .Mrs Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him .Harry and Cho looked at each other .Thanks Harry said .No problem said Cho finally fixing the parcel to the barn owls other leg her face slightly pink .You werent ordering Dungbombs were you ?No said Harry .I wonder why he thought you were then ?she said as she carried the owl to the window .Harry shrugged he was quite as mystified by that as she was though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment .They left the Owlery together .At the entrance of a corridor that led toward the west wing of the castle Cho said Im going this way .Well Ill .Ill see you around Harry .Yeah .see you .She smiled at him and departed .He walked on feeling quietly elated .He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once .You were really brave standing up to her like that .She had called him brave .She did not hate him for being alive .Of course she had preferred Cedric he knew that .Though if hed only asked her to the ball before Cedric had things might have turned out differently .She had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to refuse when Harry had asked her .Morning Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall .What are you looking so pleased about ?said Ron eyeing Harry in surprise .Erm .Quidditch later said Harry happily pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward him .Oh .yeah .said Ron .He put down the bit of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice .Then he said Listen .you dont fancy going out a bit earlier with me do you ?Just to er give me some practice before training ?So I can you know get my eye in a bit .Yeah okay said Harry .Look I dont think you should said Hermione seriously youre both really behind on homework as it But she broke off the morning post was arriving and as usual the Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch took the newspaper and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again .Anything interesting ?said Ron Harry smiled he knew Ron was keen to get her off the subject of homework .No she sighed just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married .She opened the paper and disappeared behind it .Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon Ron was staring up at the high windows looking slightly preoccupied .Wait a moment said Hermione suddenly .Oh no .Sirius !Whats happened ?said Harry and he snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione were holding half each . ‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tipoff from a reliable source that Sirius Black notorious mass murderer .blah blah blah .is currently hiding in London Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper .Lucius Malfoy Ill bet anything said Harry in a low furious voice .He did recognize Sirius on the platform .What ?said Ron looking alarmed .You didnt say Shh !said the other two . . ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous .killed thirteen people .broke out of Azkaban .the usual rubbish Hermione concluded laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron .Well he just wont be able to leave the house again thats all she whispered .Dumbledore did warn him not to .Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off .Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame Malkins Robes for All Occasions which was apparently having a sale .Hey !he said flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could both see it .Look at this !Ive got all the robes I want said Ron .No said Harry look .this little piece here .Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column .It was headlined TRESPASS AT MINISTRY Sturgis Podmore 38 of number two Laburnum Gardens Clapham has appeared in front of the Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August .Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch wizard Eric Munch who found him attempting to force his way through a topsecurity door at one oclock in the morning .Podmore who refused to speak in his own defense was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban .Sturgis Podmore ?said Ron slowly but hes that bloke who looks like his heads been thatched isnt he ?Hes one of the Ord Ron shh said Hermione casting a terrified look around them .Six months in Azkaban !whispered Harry shocked .Just for trying to get through a door !Dont be silly it wasnt just for trying to get through a door what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one oclock in the morning ?breathed Hermione .Dyou reckon he was doing something for the Order ?Ron muttered .Wait a moment .said Harry slowly .Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off remember ?The other two looked at him .Yeah he was supposed to be part of our guard going to Kings Cross remember ?And Moody was all annoyed because he didnt turn up so that doesnt seem like he was supposed to be on a iob for them does it ?Well maybe they didnt expect him to get caught said Hermione .It could be a frameup !Ron exclaimed excitedly .No listen !he went on dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermiones face .The Ministry suspects hes one of Dumbledores lot so I dunno they lured him to the Ministry and he wasnt trying to get through a door at all !Maybe theyve just made something up to get him !There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this .Harry thought it seemed farfetched Hermione on the other hand looked rather impressed and said Do you know I wouldnt be at all surprised if that were true .She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully .When Harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie .Right well I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on SelfFertilizing Shrubs first and if were lucky well be able to start McGonagalls Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch .Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs but the sky was a clear exhilarating blue and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week .I mean we can do it tonight said Ron as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch their broomsticks over their shoulders Hermiones dire warnings that they would fail all their O .W .L .s still ringing in their ears .And weve got tomorrow .She gets too worked up about work thats her trouble .There was a pause and he added in a slightly more anxious tone Dyou think she meant it when she said we werent copying from her ?Yeah I do said Harry .Still this is important too weve got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team .Yeah thats right said Ron in a heartened tone .And we have got plenty of time to do it all .Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly .Nothing flew out of them the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower .He had enough to worry about the flying horse wasnt doing him any harm He pushed it out of his mind .They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work Ron guarding the three tall goalposts Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron .Harry thought Ron was pretty good he blocked threequarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced .After a couple of hours they returned to the school where they ate lunch during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session .All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered .All right Ron ?said George winking at him .Yeah said Ron who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch .Ready to show us all up Ickle Prefect ?said Fred emerging touslehaired from the neck of his Quidditch robes a slightly malicious grin on his face .Shut up said Ron stonyfaced pulling on his own team robes for the first time .They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Woods who was rather broader in the shoulder .Okay everyone said Angelina entering from the Captains office already changed .Lets get to it Alicia and Fred if you can just bring the ball crate out for us .Oh and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them all right ?Something in her wouldbe casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were and sure enough when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangerson who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium .Whats that Weasleys riding ?Malfoy called in his sneering drawl .Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that ?Crabbe Goyle and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter .Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him watching his ears turn red from behind .Ignore them he said accelerating to catch up with Ron .Well see whos laughing after we play them .Exactly the attitude I want Harry said Angelina approvingly soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team .Okay everyone were going to start with some passes just to warm up the whole team please Hey Johnson whats with that hairstyle anyway ?shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below .Why would anyone want to look like theyve got worms coming out of their head ?Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said calmly Spread out then and lets see what we can do .Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch .Ron fell back toward the opposite goal .Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred who passed to George who passed to Harry who passed to Ron who dropped it .The Slytherins led by Malfoy roared and screamed with laughter .Ron who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed pulled out of the dive untidily so that he slipped sideways on his broom and returned to playing height blushing .Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything for which he was grateful .Pass it on Ron called Angelina as though nothing had happened .Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia who passed back to Harry who passed to George .Hey Potter hows your scar feeling ?called Malfoy .Sure you dont need a liedown ?It must be what a whole week since you were in the hospital wing thats a record for you isnt it ?Fred passed to Angelina she reverse passed to Harry who had not been expecting it but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron who lunged for it and missed by inches .Come on now Ron said Angelina crossly as Ron dived for the ground again chasing the Quaffle .Pay attention .It would have been hard to say whether Rons face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height .Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter .On his third attempt Ron caught the Quaffle perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katies outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face .Sorry !Ron groaned zooming forward to see whether he had done any damage .Get back in position shes fine !barked Angelina .But as youre passing to a teammate do try not to knock her off her broom wont you ?Weve got Bludgers for that !Katies nose was bleeding .Down below the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering .Fred and George converged on Katie .Here take this Fred told her handing her something small and purple from out of his pocket .Itll clear it up in no time .All right called Angelina Fred George go and get your bats and a Bludger Ron get up to the goalposts Harry release the Snitch when I say so .Were going to aim for Rons goal obviously .Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch .Rons making a right pigs ear of things isnt he ?muttered George as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch .Hes just nervous said Harry .He was fine when I was practicing with him this morning .Yeah well I hope he hasnt peaked too soon said Fred gloomily .They returned to the air .When Angelina blew her whistle Harry released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger from that moment on Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing .It was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seekers team and doing so required enormous speed and skill .He accelerated rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers the warm autumn air whipping his face and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears .But too soon the whistle brought him to a halt again .Stop stop STOP !screamed Angelina .Ron youre not covering your middle post !Harry looked around at Ron who was hovering in front of the lefthand hoop leaving the other two completely unprotected .Oh .sorry .You keep shifting around while youre watching the Chasers !said Angelina .Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop or else circle the hoops but dont drift vaguely off to one side thats how you let in the last three goals !Sorry .Ron repeated his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky .And Katie cant you do something about that nosebleed ?Its just getting worse !said Katie thickly attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve .Harry glanced around at Fred who was looking anxious and checking his pockets .He saw Fred pull out something purple examine it for a second and then look around at Katie evidently horrorstruck .Well lets try again said Angelina .She was ignoring the Slytherins who had now set up a chant of Gryffindor are losers Gryffindor are losers but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless .This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelinas whistle sounded .Harry who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved .What now ?he said impatiently to Alicia who was nearest .Katie she said shortly .Harry turned and saw Angelina Fred and George all flying as fast as they could toward Katie .Harry and Alicia sped toward her too .It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time Katie was now chalk white and covered in blood .She needs the hospital wing said Angelina .Well take her said Fred .She er might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake Well theres no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone said Angelina glumly as Fred and George zoomed off toward the castle supporting Katie between them .Come on lets go and get changed .The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms .How was practice ?asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room .It was Harry began .Completely lousy said Ron in a hollow voice sinking into a chair beside Hermione .She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to melt .Well it was only your first one she said consolingly its bound to take time to Who said it was me who made it lousy ?snapped Ron .No one said Hermione looking taken aback I thought You thought I was bound to be rubbish ?No of course I didnt !Look you said it was lousy so I just Im going to get started on some homework said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys dormitories and vanished from sight .Hermione turned to Harry .Was he lousy ?No said Harry loyally .Hermione raised her eyebrows .Well I suppose he couldve played better Harry muttered but it was only the first training session like you said .Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night .Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the chant of Gryffindor are losers out of his head .They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room buried in their books while the room around them filled up then emptied It was another clear fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year .By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull .You know we probably should try and get more homework done during the week Harry muttered to Ron as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagalls long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiters moons .Yeah said Ron rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them .Listen .shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what shes done ?Harry glanced over at her she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks .No he said heavily you know she wont let us .And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker slowly the crowd in the common room began to thin again .At halfpast eleven Hermione wandered over to them yawning .Nearly done ?No said Ron shortly .Jupiters biggest moon is Ganymede not Callisto she said pointing over Rons shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay and its Io thats got the volcanos .Thanks snarled Ron scratching out the offending sentences .Sorry I only Yeah well if youve just come over here to criticize Ron I havent got time to listen to a sermon all right Hermione Im up to my neck in it here No look !Hermione was pointing to the nearest window .Harry and Ron both looked over .A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill gazing into the room at Ron .Isnt that Hermes ?said Hermione sounding amazed .Blimey it is !said Ron quietly throwing down his quill and getting to his feet .Whats Percy writing to me for ?He crossed to the window and opened it Hermes flew inside landed upon Rons essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached .Ron took it off and the owl departed at once leaving inky footprints across Rons drawing of the moon Io .Thats definitely Percys handwriting said Ron sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll To Ronald Weasley Gryffindor House Hogwarts .He looked up at the other two .What dyou reckon ?Open it !said Hermione eagerly .Harry nodded .Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read .The farther down the parchment his eyes traveled the more pronounced became his scowl .When he had finished reading he looked disgusted .He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione who leaned toward each other to read it together Dear Ron I have only just heard from no less a person than the Minister of Magic himself who has it from your new teacher Professor Umbridge that you have become a Hogwarts prefect I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations .I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the Fred and George route rather than following in my footsteps so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility .But I want to give you more than congratulations Ron I want to give you some advice which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post Hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions .From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter .I must tell you Ron that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that boy .Yes I am sure you are surprised to hear this no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledores favorite but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different and probably more accurate view of Potters behavior .I shall say no more here but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing and see if you can spot yours truly !Seriously Ron you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter it could be very damaging to your future prospects and I am talking here about life after school too .As you must be aware given that our father escorted him to court Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good .He got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people Ive spoken to remain convinced of his guilt .It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter I know that he can be unbalanced and for all I know violent but if you have any worries about this or have spotted anything else in Potters behavior that is troubling you I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge a really delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you .This leads me to my other bit of advice .As I have hinted above Dumbledores regime at Hog warts may soon be over .Your loyalty Ron should be not to him but to the school and the Ministry .I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires although she should find this easier from next week again see the Prophet tomorrow .I shall say only this a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well placed for Head Boy ship in a couple of years !I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer .It pains me to criticize our parents but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore if you are writing to Mother at any point you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore who is a great friend of Dumbledores has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry .Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders .I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people the Minister really could not be more gracious to me and I do hope Ron that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents beliefs and actions either .I sincerely hope that in time they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall of course be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes .Please think over what I have said most carefully particularly the bit about Harry Potter and congratulations again on becoming prefect .Your brother Percy Harry looked up at Ron .Well he said trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke if you want to er what is it ?He checked Percys letter .Oh yeah ‘sever ties with me I swear I wont get violent .Give it back said Ron holding out his hand .He is Ron said jerkily tearing Percys letter in half the worlds he tore it into quarters biggest he tore it into eighths git .He threw the pieces into the fire .Come on weve got to get this finished some time before dawn he said briskly to Harry pulling Professor Sinistra s essay back toward him .Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face .Oh give them here she said abruptly .What ?said Ron .Give them to me Ill look through them and correct them she said .Are you serious ?Ah Hermione youre a lifesaver said Ron what can I ?What you can say is ‘We promise well never leave our homework this late again she said holding out both hands for their essays but she looked slightly amused all the same .Thanks a million Hermione said Harry weakly passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair rubbing his eyes .It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks .The only sound was that of Hermiones quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table .Harry was exhausted .He also felt an odd sick empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire .He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange even mad he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percys writing about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to Umbridge that made his situation real to him as nothing else had .He had known Percy for four years had stayed in his house during the summers shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year yet now Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent .And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather Harry thought that Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment because Sirius was in the same situation nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years .Harry blinked .He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there .It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately .No .it could not have been .He had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius .Okay write that down Hermione said to Ron pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron and then copy out this conclusion that Ive written for you .Hermione you are honestly the most wonderful person Ive ever met said Ron weakly and if Im ever rude to you again Ill know youre back to normal said Hermione .Harry yours is okay except for this bit at the end I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra Europas covered in ice not mice Harry ?Harry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug gazing into the flames .Er Harry ?said Ron uncertainly .Why are you down there ?Because Ive just seen Siriuss head in the fire said Harry .He spoke quite calmly after all he had seen Siriuss head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too .Nevertheless he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time .It had vanished so quickly .Siriuss head ?Hermione repeated .You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament ?But he wouldnt do that now it would be too Siriusl She gasped gazing at the fire Ron dropped his quill .There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Siriuss head long dark hair falling around his grinning face .I was starting to think youd go to bed before everyone else had disappeared he said .Ive been checking every hour .Youve been popping into the fire every hour ?Harry said half laughing .Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet .But what if youd been seen ?said Hermione anxiously .Well I think a girl first year by the look of her mightve got a glimpse of me earlier but dont worry Sirius said hastily as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth .I was gone the moment she looked back at me and Ill bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something .But Sirius this is taking an awful risk Hermione began .You sound like Molly said Sirius .This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harrys letter without resorting to a code and codes are breakable .At the mention of Harrys letter Hermione and Ron had both turned to stare at him .You didnt say youd written to Sirius !said Hermione accusingly .I forgot said Harry which was perfectly true his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind .Dont look at me like that Hermione there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it was there Sirius ?No it was very good said Sirius smiling .Anyway wed better be quick just in case were disturbed your scar .What about ?Ron began but Hermione said quickly Well tell you afterward go on Sirius .Well I know it cant be fun when it hurts but we dont think its anything to really worry about .It kept aching all last year didnt it ?Yeah and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion said Harry ignoring as usual Ron and Hermione s winces .So maybe he was just I dunno really angry or something the night I had that detention .Well now hes back its bound to hurt more often said Sirius .So you dont think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her ?Harry asked .I doubt it said Sirius .I know her by reputation and Im sure shes no Death Eater Shes foul enough to be one said Harry darkly and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement .Yes but the world isnt split into good people and Death Eaters said Sirius with a wry smile .I know shes a nasty piece of work though you should hear Remus talk about her .Does Lupin know her ?asked Harry quickly remembering Umbridges comments about dangerous halfbreeds during her first lesson .No said Sirius but she drafted a bit of anti werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job .Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further .Whats she got against werewolves ?said Hermione angrily .Scared of them I expect said Sirius smiling at her indignation .Apparently she loathes parthumans she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too .Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset .Sirius !she said reproachfully .Honestly if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher Im sure hed respond after all you are the only member of his family hes got left and Professor Dumbledore said So what are Umbridges lessons like ?Sirius interrupted .Is she training you all to kill half breeds ?No said Harry ignoring Hermiones affronted look at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher .Shes not letting us use magic at all !All we do is read the stupid textbook said Ron .Ah well that figures said Sirius .Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesnt want you trained in combat .Trained in combat ?repeated Harry incredulously .What does he think were doing here forming some sort of wizard army ?Thats exactly what he thinks youre doing said Sirius or rather thats exactly what hes afraid Dumbledores doing forming his own private army with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic .There was a pause at this then Ron said Thats the stupidest thing Ive ever heard including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with .So were being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared well use spells against the Ministry ?said Hermione looking furious .Yep said Sirius .Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power .Hes getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day .Its a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumpedup charge .This reminded Harry of Percys letter .Dyou know if theres going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow ?Only Rons brother Percy reckons there will be I dont know said Sirius I havent seen anyone from the Order all weekend theyre all busy .Its just been Kreacher and me here .There was a definite note of bitterness in Siriuss voice .So you havent had any news about Hagrid either ?Ah .said Sirius well he was supposed to be back by now no ones sure whats happened to him .Then seeing their stricken faces he added quickly But Dumbledores not worried so dont you three get yourselves in a state Im sure Hagrids fine .But if he was supposed to be back by now .said Hermione in a small worried voice .Madame Maxime was with him weve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home but theres nothing to suggest hes hurt or well nothing to suggest hes not perfectly okay .Unconvinced Harry Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks .Listen dont go asking too many questions about Hagrid said Sirius hastily itll just draw even more attention to the fact that hes not back and I know Dumbledore doesnt want that .Hagrids tough hell be okay .And when they did not appear cheered by this Sirius added Whens your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway ?I was thinking we got away with the dog disguise at the station didnt we ?I thought I could NO !said Harry and Hermione together very loudly .Sirius didnt you see the Daily Prophet ?said Hermione anxiously .Oh that said Sirius grinning theyre always guessing where I am they havent really got a clue Yeah but we think this time they have said Harry .Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you and his father was on the platform Sirius you know Lucius Malfoy so dont come up here whatever you do if Malfoy recognizes you again All right all right Ive got the point said Sirius .He looked most displeased .Just an idea thought you might like to get together I would I just dont want you chucked back in Azkaban !said Harry .There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry a crease between his sunken eyes .Youre less like your father than I thought he said finally a definite coolness in his voice .The risk wouldve been what made it fun for James .Look Well Id better get going I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs said Sirius but Harry was sure he was lying .Ill write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire then shall I ?If you can stand to risk it ?There was a tiny pop and the place where Siriuss head had been was flickering flame once more .THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR They had expected to have to comb Hermiones Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter .However the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRSTEVER HIGH INQUISITOR High Inquisitor ?said Harry darkly his halfeaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers .What does that mean ?Hermione read aloud In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . ‘The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings on at Hogwarts for some time said Junior Assistant to the Minister Percy Weasley . ‘He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve .This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school .As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty two was passed to ensure that in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post the Ministry should select an appropriate person . ‘Thats how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts said Weasley last night . ‘Dumbledore couldnt find anyone so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course shes been an immediate success Shes been a WHAT ?said Harry loudly .Wait theres more said Hermione grimly . ‘ an immediate success totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with ontheground feedback about whats really happening at Hogwarts .It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twentythree which creates the new position of ‘Hogwarts High Inquisitor .‘This is an exciting new phase in the Ministers plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at Hog warts said Weasley . ‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch .Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted .The Ministrys new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts . ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation said Mr Lucius Malfoy 41 speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night . ‘Many of us with our childrens best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledores eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation .Among those ‘eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin half giant Rubeus Hagrid and delusional exAuror ‘MadEye Moody .Rumors abound of course that Albus Dumbledore once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts . ‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence said a Ministry insider last night .Wizengamot elders Gris elda M archbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts . ‘Hogwarts is a school not an outpost of Cornelius Fudges office said Madam Marchbanks . ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore .For a full account of Madam Marchbanks alleged links to subversive goblin groups turn to page 17 .Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two .So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge !Fudge passed this ‘Educational Decree and forced her on us !And now hes given her the power to inspect other teachers !Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright .I cant believe this .Its outrageous .I know it is said Harry .He looked down at his right hand clenched upon the tabletop and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin .But a grin was unfurling on Rons face .What ?said Harry and Hermione together staring at him .Oh I cant wait to see McGonagall inspected said Ron happily .Umbridge wont know whats hit her .Well come on said Hermione jumping up wed better get going if shes inspecting Binnss class we dont want to be late .But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson which was just as dull as the previous Monday nor was she in Snapes dungeon when they arrived for double Potions where Harrys moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner .I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O .W .L said Snape with a smirk as he swept among them passing back their homework .This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination .Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them .The general standard of this homework was abysmal .Most of you would have failed had this been your examination .I expect to see a great deal more effort for this weeks essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get Ds .He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper Some people got Ds ?Ha !Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible feeling that he would rather keep that information private .Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them .His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione s but it was at least blue rather than pink like Nevilles and he delivered a flask of it to Snapes desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief .Well that wasnt as bad as last week was it ?said Hermione as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch .And the homework didnt go too badly either did it ?When neither Ron nor Harry answered she pressed on I mean all right I didnt expect the top grade not if hes marking to O .W .L .standard but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage wouldnt you say ?Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat .Of course a lot can happen between now and the exam weve got plenty of time to improve but the grades were getting now are a sort of baseline arent they ?Something we can build on .They sat down together at the Gryffindor table .Obviously Id have been thrilled if Id gotten an O Hermione said Ron sharply if you want to know what grades we got ask .I dont I didnt mean well if you want to tell me I got a P said Ron ladling soup into his bowl .Happy ?Well thats nothing to be ashamed of said Fred who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harrys right .Nothing wrong with a good healthy P .But said Hermione doesnt P stand for .Boor yeah said Lee Jordan .Still better than D isnt it ? ‘Dreadful ?Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll .When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O .W .L .grades .So top grades O for ‘Outstanding she was saying and then theres A No E George corrected her E for ‘Exceeds Expectations .And Ive always thought Fred and I shouldve got E in everything because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams .They all laughed except Hermione who plowed on So after E its A for ‘Acceptable and thats the last pass grade isnt it ?Yep said Fred dunking an entire roll in his soup transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole .Then you get P for ‘Poor Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration and D for ‘Dreadful .And then T George reminded him .T ?asked Hermione looking appalled .Even lower than a D ?What on earth does that stand for ?Troll said George promptly .Harry laughed again though he was not sure whether or not George was joking .He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received Ts in all his O .W .L .s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on .You lot had an inspected lesson yet ?Fred asked them .No said Hermione at once have you ?Just now before lunch said George .Charms .What was it like ?Harry and Hermione asked together .Fred shrugged .Not that bad .Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard .You know what Flitwicks like he treated her like a guest didnt seem to bother him at all .She didnt say much .Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like Alicia told her they were really good that was it .I cant see old Flitwick getting marked down said George he usually gets everyone through their exams all right .Whove you got this afternoon ?Fred asked Harry .Trelawney A T if ever I saw one and Umbridge herself .Well be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today said George .Angelinall do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices .But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge .He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and looking round he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor .The class which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once .The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles look round .Good afternoon Professor Trelawney said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile .You received my note I trust ?Giving the time and date of your inspection ?Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and looking very disgruntled turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books .Still smiling Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawneys seat .She then sat down took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly waiting for the class to begin .Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses .We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones though her voice shook slightly .Divide into pairs please and interpret each others latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle .She made as though to sweep back to her seat saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender who were already deep in discussion about Parvatis most recent dream .Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle watching Umbridge covertly .She was making notes on her clipboard now .After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawneys wake listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there .Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book .Think of a dream quick he told Ron in case the old toad comes our way .I did it last time Ron protested its your turn you tell me one .Oh I dunno .said Harry desperately who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days .Lets say I dreamed I was .drowning Snape in my cauldron .Yeah thatll do .Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle .Okay weve got to add your age to the date you had the dream the number of letters in the subject .would that be ‘drowning or ‘cauldron or ‘Snape ?It doesnt matter pick any of them said Harry chancing a glance behind him .Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawneys shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary .What night did you dream this again ?Ron said immersed in calculations .I dunno last night whenever you like Harry told him trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney .They were only a table away from him and Ron now .Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out .Now said Umbridge looking up at Trelawney youve been in this post how long exactly ?Professor Trelawney scowled at her arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection .After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it she said in a deeply resentful tone Nearly sixteen years .Quite a period said Professor Umbridge making a note on her clipboard .So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you ?Thats right said Professor Trelawney shortly .Professor Umbridge made another note .And you are a greatgreatgranddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney ?Yes said Professor Trelawney holding her head a little higher .Another note on the clipboard .But I think correct me if I am mistaken that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight ?These things often skip er three generations said Professor Trelawney .Professor Umbridges toadlike smile widened .Of course she said sweetly making yet another note .Well if you could just predict something for me then ?She looked up inquiringly still smiling .Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears .I dont understand you said Professor Trelawney clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck .Id like you to make a prediction for me said Professor Umbridge very clearly .Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height her beads and bangles clinking .The Inner Eye does not See upon command !she said in scandalized tones .I see said Professor Umbridge softly making yet another note on her clipboard .I but but .wait said Professor Trelawney suddenly in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger .I .I think I do see something .something that concerns you .Why I sense something .something dark .some grave peril .Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her eyebrows raised .I am afraid .I am afraid that you are in grave danger !Professor Trelawney finished dramatically .There was a pause .Professor Umbridges eyebrows were still raised .Right she said softly scribbling on her clipboard once more .Well if thats really the best you can do She turned away leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot her chest heaving .Harry caught Rons eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud but on the other hand they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawneys side until she swooped down on them a few seconds later that was .Well ?she said snapping her long fingers under Harrys nose uncharacteristically brisk .Let me see the start youve made on your dream diary please .And by the time she had interpreted Harrys dreams at the top of her voice all of which even the ones that involved eating porridge apparently foretold a gruesome and early death he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her .All the while Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away making notes on that clipboard and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later .She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room .Harry and Ron told Hermione who had been in Arithmancy exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell .Wands away she instructed them all smilingly and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags .As we finished chapter one last lesson I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two ‘Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation .There will be no need to talk .Still smiling her wide selfsatisfied smile she sat down at her desk .The class gave an audible sigh as it turned as one to page nineteen .Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again .Professor Umbridge had noticed too and what was more she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality .Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were facetoface then she bent down and whispered so that the rest of the class could not hear What is it this time Miss Granger ?Ive already read chapter two said Hermione .Well then proceed to chapter three .Ive read that too .Ive read the whole book .Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly .Well then you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen .He says that counterjinxes are improperly named said Hermione promptly .He says ‘counterjinx is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable .Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows and Harry knew she was impressed against her will .But I disagree Hermione continued .Professor Umbridges eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder .You disagree ?Yes I do said Hermione who unlike Umbridge was not whispering but speaking in a clear carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the classs attention .Mr Slinkhard doesnt like jinxes does he ?But I think they can be very useful when theyre used defensively .Oh you do do you ?said Professor Umbridge forgetting to whisper and straightening up .Well Im afraid it is Mr Slinkhard s opinion and not yours that matters within this classroom Miss Granger .But Hermione began .That is enough said Professor Umbridge .She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone .Miss Granger I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House .There was an outbreak of muttering at this .What for ?said Harry angrily .Dont you get involved !Hermione whispered urgently to him .For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions said Professor Umbridge smoothly .I am here to teach you using a Ministryapproved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little .Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license but as none of them with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell who did at least appear to have restricted himself to ageappropriate subjects would have passed a Ministry inspection Yeah Quirrell was a great teacher said Harry loudly there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head .This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard .Then I think another weeks detentions would do you some good Mr Potter said Umbridge sleekly .k k k The cut on the back of Harrys hand had barely healed and by the following morning it was bleeding again .He did not complain during the evenings detention he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips though the cut deepened with every letter .The very worst part of this second weeks worth of detentions was just as George had predicted Angelinas reaction .She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table .Miss Johnson how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall !Five points from Gryffindor !But Professor hes gone and landed himself in detention again Whats this Potter ?said Professor McGonagall sharply rounding on Harry .Detention ?From whom ?From Professor Umbridge muttered Harry not meeting Professor McGonagalls beady squareframed eyes .Are you telling me she said lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridges class again ?Yes Harry muttered speaking to the floor .Potter you must get a grip on yourself !You are heading for serious trouble !Another five points from Gryffindor !But what ?Professor no !Harry said furious at this injustice .Im already being punished by her why do you have to take points as well ?Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever !said Professor McGonagall tartly .No not another word of complaint Potter !And as for you Miss Johnson you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy !She strode back toward the staff table .Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron fuming .Shes taken points off Gryffindor because Im having my hand sliced open every night !How is that fair how ?I know mate said Ron sympathetically tipping bacon onto Harrys plate shes bang out of order .Hermione however merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing .You think McGonagall was right do you ?said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione s face .I wish she hadnt taken points from you but I think shes right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge said Hermiones voice while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page clearly giving some kind of speech .Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head .Excellent whispered Ron as they sat down in their usual seats .Lets see Umbridge get what she deserves .Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there .That will do she said and silence fell immediately .Mr Finnigan kindly come here and hand back the homework Miss Brown please take this box of mice dont be silly girl they wont hurt you and hand one to each student Hem hem said Professor Umbridge employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term .Professor McGonagall ignored her .Seamus handed back Harrys essay Harry took it without looking at him and saw to his relief that he had managed an A .Right then everyone listen closely Dean Thomas if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell .Today we shall be Hem hem said Professor Umbridge .Yes ?said Professor McGonagall turning round her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long severe line .I was just wondering Professor whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec Obviously I received it or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom said Professor McGonagall turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge .Many of the students exchanged looks of glee .As I was saying today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice .Now the Vanishing Spell Hem hem .I wonder said Professor McGonagall in cold fury turning on Professor Umbridge how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me ?You see I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking .Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face .She did not speak but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously .Looking supremely unconcerned Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more .As I was saying the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished .The snail as an invertebrate does not present much of a challenge the mouse as a mammal offers a much greater one .This is not therefore magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner .So you know the incantation let me see what you can do .How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge !Harry said to Ron under his voice but he was grinning his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated .Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it .She did however take many more notes while she sat in her corner and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away rose with a grim expression on her face .Well its a start said Ron holding up a long wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around .As they filed out of the classroom Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teachers desk he nudged Ron who nudged Hermione in turn and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop .How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts ?Professor Umbridge asked .Thirtynine years this December said Professor McGonagall brusquely snapping her bag shut .Professor Umbridge made a note .Very well she said you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days time .I can hardly wait said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice and she strode off toward the door .Hurry up you three she added sweeping Harry Ron and Hermione before her .Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return .He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening but he was wrong .When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor GrubblyPlank .You do not usually take this class is that correct ?Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs .Quite correct said Professor GrubblyPlank hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet .I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid .Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione .Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry .Hmm said Professor Umbridge dropping her voice though Harry could still hear her quite clearly I wonder the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrids very extended leave of absence ?Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly .Fraid I cant said Professor GrubblyPlank breezily .Dont know anything more about it than you do .Got an owl from Dumbledore would I like a couple of weeks teaching work accepted thats as much as I know .Well .shall I get started then ?Yes please do said Professor Umbridge scribbling upon her clipboard .Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students questioning them on magical creatures .Most people were able to answer well and Harrys spirits lifted somewhat at least the class was not letting Hagrid down .Overall said Professor Umbridge returning to Professor GrubblyPlanks side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas how do you as a temporary member of staff an objective outsider I suppose you might say how do you find Hogwarts ?Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management ?Oh yes Dumbledores excellent said Professor GrubblyPlank heartily .No Im very happy with the way things are run very happy indeed .Looking politely incredulous Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on And what are you planning to cover with this class this year assuming of course that Professor Hagrid does not return ?Oh Ill take them through the creatures that most often come up in O .W .L .said Professor Grubbly Plank .Not much left to do theyve studied unicorns and nifflers I thought wed cover porlocks and kneazles make sure they can recognize crups and knarls you know .Well you seem to know what youre doing at any rate said Professor Umbridge making a very obvious tick on her clipboard .Harry did not like the emphasis she put on you and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle Now I hear there have been injuries in this class ?Goyle gave a stupid grin .Malfoy hastened to answer the question .That was me he said .I was slashed by a hippogriff .A hippogriff ?said Professor Umbridge now scribbling frantically .Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do said Harry angrily .Both Ron and Hermione groaned .Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harrys direction .Another nights detention I think she said softly .Well thank you very much Professor GrubblyPlank I think thats all I need here .You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days .Jolly good said Professor GrubblyPlank and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle .ie ie ie It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridges office that night his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it .He expected the common room to be empty when he returned but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him .He was pleased to see them especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical .Here she said anxiously pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him soak your hand in that its a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles it should help .Harry placed his bleeding aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief .Crookshanks curled around his legs purring loudly and then leapt into his lap and settled down .Thanks he said gratefully scratching behind Crookshanks s ears with his left hand .I still reckon you should complain about this said Ron in a low voice .No said Harry flatly .McGonagall would go nuts if she knew Yeah she probably would said Harry .And how long dyou reckon itd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately ?Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way .Shes an awful woman said Hermione in a small voice .Awful .You know I was just saying to Ron when you came in .weve got to do something about her .I suggested poison said Ron grimly .No .I mean something about what a dreadful teacher she is and how were not going to learn any defense from her at all said Hermione .Well what can we do about that ?said Ron yawning .S too late isnt it ?She got the job shes here to stay Fudgell make sure of that .Well said Hermione tentatively .You know I was thinking today .She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on I was thinking that maybe the times come when we should just just do it ourselves .Do what ourselves ?said Harry suspiciously still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles .Well learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves said Hermione .Come off it groaned Ron .You want us to do extra work ?Dyou realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and its only the second week ?But this is much more important than homework !said Hermione .Harry and Ron goggled at her .I didnt think there was anything in the universe more important than homework said Ron .Dont be silly of course there is !said Hermione and Harry saw with an ominous feeling that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S .P .E .W .usually inspired in her .Its about preparing ourselves like Harry said in Umbridges first lesson for whats waiting out there .Its about making sure we really can defend ourselves .If we dont learn anything for a whole year We cant do much by ourselves said Ron in a defeated voice .I mean all right we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them I suppose No I agree weve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books said Hermione .We need a teacher a proper one who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if were going wrong .If youre talking about Lupin .Harry began .No no Im not talking about Lupin said Hermione .Hes too busy with the Order and anyway the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and thats not nearly often enough .Who then ?said Harry frowning at her .Hermione heaved a very deep sigh .Isnt it obvious ?she said .Im talking about you Harry .There was a moments silence .A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered .About me what ?said Harry .Im talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts .Harry stared at her .Then he turned to Ron ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on farfetched schemes like S .P .E .W .To Harrys consternation however Ron did not look exasperated .He was frowning slightly apparently thinking .Then he said Thats an idea .Whats an idea ?said Harry .You said Ron .Teaching us to do it .But .Harry was grinning now sure the pair of them were pulling his leg .But Im not a teacher I cant Harry youre the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts said Hermione .Me ?said Harry now grinning more broadly than ever .No Im not youve beaten me in every test Actually I havent said Hermione coolly .You beat me in our third year the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject But Im not talking about test results Harry .Look what youve done How dyou mean ?You know what Im not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me Ron said to Hermione smirking slightly .He turned to Harry .Lets think he said pulling a face like Goyle concentrating .Uh .first year you saved the Stone from YouKnowWho .But that was luck said Harry that wasnt skill Second year Ron interrupted you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle .Yeah but if Fawkes hadnt turned up I Third year said Ron louder still you fought off about a hundred dementors at once You know that was a fluke if the TimeTurner hadnt ?Last year Ron said almost shouting now you fought off YouKnowWho again Listen to me !said Harry almost angrily because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now .Just listen to me all right ?It sounds great when you say it like that but all that stuff was luck I didnt know what I was doing half the time I didnt plan any of it I just did whatever I could think of and I nearly always had help Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise he wasnt even sure why he was feeling so angry .Dont sit there grinning like you know better than I do I was there wasnt I ?he said heatedly .I know what went on all right ?And I didnt get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts I got through it all because because help came at the right time or because I guessed right but I just blundered through it all I didnt have a clue what I was doing STOP LAUGHING !The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed .He became aware that he was on his feet though he couldnt remember standing up .Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa Ron and Hermione s smiles had vanished .You dont know what its likel You neither of you youve never had to face him have you ?You think its just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him like youre in class or something ?The whole time you know theres nothing between you and dying except your own your own brain or guts or whatever like you can think straight when you know youre about a second from being murdered or tortured or watching your friends die theyve never taught us that in their classes what its like to deal with things like that and you two sit there acting like Im a clever little boy to be standing here alive like Diggory was stupid like he messed up you just dont get it that could just as easily have been me it would have been if Voldemort hadnt needed me We werent saying anything like that mate said Ron looking aghast .We werent having a go at Diggory we didnt youve got the wrong end of the He looked helplessly at Hermione whose face was stricken .Harry she said timidly dont you see ?This .this is exactly why we need you .We need to know what its rreally like .facing him .facing VVoldemort .It was the first time she had ever said Voldemorts name and it was this more than anything else that calmed Harry .Still breathing hard he sank back into his chair becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again .He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence .Well .think about it said Hermione quietly .Please ?Harry could not think of anything to say .He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already .He nodded hardly aware of what he was agreeing to .Hermione stood up .Well Im off to bed she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it .Erm .night .Ron had gotten to his feet too .Coming ?he said awkwardly to Harry .Yeah said Harry .In .in a minute .Ill just clear this up .He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor .Ron nodded and left .Reparo Harry muttered pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china .They flew back together good as new but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl .He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs .His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again .IN THE HOGS HEAD Hermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion .Harrys detentions with Umbridge were finally over he doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens before the subject was broached again on a wild blustery evening at the end of September when the three of them were sitting in the library looking up potion ingredients for Snape .I was wondering Hermione said suddenly whether youd thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts Harry .Course I have said Harry grumpily .Cant forget it can we with that hag teaching us I meant the idea Ron and I had Ron cast her an alarmed threatening kind of look she frowned at him oh all right the idea had then about you teaching us .Harry did not answer at once .He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic AntiVenoms because he did not want to say what was in his mind .The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight .Sometimes it seemed an insane idea just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it but at others he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters found himself in fact subconsciously planning lessons .Well he said slowly when he could not pretend to find Asiatic antivenoms interesting much longer yeah I Ive thought about it a bit .And ?said Hermione eagerly .I dunno said Harry playing for time .He looked up at Ron .I thought it was a good idea from the start said Ron who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that Harry was not going to start shouting again .Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair .You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck didnt you ?Yes Harry said Hermione gently but all the same theres no point pretending that youre not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts because you are .You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely you can produce a Patronus you can do all sorts of stuff that fullgrown wizards cant Viktor always said Ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck rubbing it he said Yeah ?What did Vicky say ?Ho ho said Hermione in a bored voice .He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didnt and he was in the final year at Durmstrang .Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously .Youre not still in contact with him are you ?So what if I am ?said Hermione coolly though her face was a little pink .I can have a pen pal if I He didnt only want to be your pen pal said Ron accusingly .Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and ignoring Ron who was continuing to watch her said to Harry Well what do you think ?Will you teach us ?Just you and Ron yeah ?Well said Hermione now looking a mite anxious again .Well .now dont fly off the handle again Harry please .But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn .I mean were talking about defending ourselves against VVoldemort oh dont be pathetic Ron it doesnt seem fair if we dont offer the chance to other people .Harry considered this for a moment then said Yeah but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me .Im a nutter remember ?Well I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what youve got to say said Hermione seriously .Look she leaned toward him Ron who was still watching her with a frown on his face leaned forward to listen too you know the first weekend in Octobers a Hogsmeade weekend ?How would it be if we tell anyone whos interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over ?Why do we have to do it outside school ?said Ron .Because said Hermione returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying I dont think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to .Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade but there was one thing worrying him .Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him to come but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway .What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy ?Well you cant blame him for wanting to get out and about said Ron when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione .I mean hes been on the run for over two years hasnt he and I know that cant have been a laugh but at least he was free wasnt he ?And now hes just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf .Hermione scowled at Ron but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher .The trouble is she said to Harry until VVoldemort oh for heavens sake Ron comes out into the open Sirius is going to have to stay hidden isnt he ?I mean the stupid Ministry isnt going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledores been telling the truth about him all along .And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again itll be obvious Sirius isnt one .I mean he hasnt got the Mark for one thing .I dont reckon hed be stupid enough to turn up said Ron bracingly .Dumbledored go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesnt like what he hears .When Harry continued to look worried Hermione said Listen Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts and there are a couple who seem interested .Weve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade .Right said Harry vaguely his mind still on Sirius .Dont worry Harry Hermione said quietly .Youve got enough on your plate without Sirius too .She was quite right of course he was barely keeping up with his homework though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge .Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry because while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week Ron also had prefect duties .However Hermione who was taking more subjects than either of them had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes .Harry had to admit that she was getting better it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks .The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy .After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village .With a slight pang Harry remembered that if it hadnt been for Sirius he would not have been going at all .When Harry reached Filch the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry .Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on out onto the stone steps and the cold sunlit day .Er why was Filch sniffing you ?asked Ron as he Harry and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates .I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs said Harry with a small laugh .I forgot to tell you .And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later demanding to see the letter .To his slight surprise Hermione found this story highly interesting much more indeed than he did himself .He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs ?But who had tipped him off ?I dunno said Harry shrugging .Maybe Malfoy hed think it was a laugh .They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left onto the road into the village the wind whipping their hair into their eyes .Malfoy ?said Hermione very skeptically .Well .yes .maybe .And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade .Where are we going anyway ?Harry asked .The Three Broomsticks ?Oh no said Hermione coming out of her reverie no its always packed and really noisy .Ive told the others to meet us in the Hogs Head that other pub you know the one its not on the main road .I think its a bit .you know .dodgy .but students dont normally go in there so I dont think well be overheard .They walked down the main street past Zonkos Joke Shop where they were unsurprised to see Fred George and Lee Jordan past the post office from which owls issued at regular intervals and turned up a side street at the top of which stood a small inn .A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door with a picture upon it of a wild boars severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it .The sign creaked in the wind as they approached .All three of them hesitated outside the door .Well come on said Hermione slightly nervously .Harry led the way inside .It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness .The Hogs Head bar comprised one small dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats .The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables .The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy though as Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries .Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year Yeh get a lot o funny folk in the Hogs Head he had said explaining how he had won a dragons egg from a hooded stranger there .At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hogs Head .There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking fiery substance through a slit over his mouth .Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick black veil that fell to her toes .They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly .I dont know about this Hermione Harry muttered as they crossed to the bar .He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch .Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that ?Hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure .Umbridge is shorter than that woman she said quietly .And anyway even if Umbridge does come in here theres nothing she can do to stop us Harry because Ive double and triplechecked the school rules .Were not outofbounds I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hogs Head and he said yes but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses .And Ive looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and theyre definitely allowed .I just dont think its a good idea if we parade what were doing .No said Harry dryly especially as its not exactly a homework group youre planning is it ?The barman sidled toward them out of a back room .He was a grumpylooking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and beard .He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry .What ?he grunted .Three butterbeers please said Hermione .The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty very dirty bottles which he slammed on the bar .Six Sickles he said .Ill get them said Harry quickly passing over the silver .The barmans eyes traveled over Harry resting for a fraction of a second on his scar .Then he turned away and deposited Harrys money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it .Harry Ron and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down looking around while the man in the dirty gray bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman .You know what ?Ron murmured looking over at the bar with enthusiasm .We could order anything we liked in here I bet that bloke would sell us anything he wouldnt care .Ive always wanted to try firewhisky You are a prefect snarled Hermione .Oh said Ron the smile fading from his face .Yeah So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us ?Harry asked wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig .Just a couple of people Hermione repeated checking her watch and then looking anxiously toward the door .I told them to be here about now and Im sure they all know where it is oh look this might be them now The door of the pub had opened .A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people .First came Neville with Dean and Lavender who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with Harrys stomach did a back flip Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends then on her own and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident Luna Lovegood then Katie Bell Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan Justin FinchFletchley Hannah Abbott and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein Michael Corner and Terry Boot Ginny followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and bringing up the rear Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonkos merchandise .A couple of people ?said Harry hoarsely to Hermione .A couple of people ?Yes well the idea seemed quite popular said Hermione happily .Ron do you want to pull up some more chairs ?The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed .Possibly he had never seen his pub so full .Hi said Fred reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly .Could we have .twenty five butterbeers please ?The barman glared at him for a moment then throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar .Cheers said Fred handing them out .Cough up everyone I havent got enough gold for all of these .Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins .He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech at which he rounded on Hermione .What have you been telling people ?he said in a low voice .What are they expecting ?Ive told you they just want to hear what youve got to say said Hermione soothingly but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly You dont have to do anything yet Ill speak to them first .Hi Harry said Neville beaming and taking a seat opposite Harry .Harry tried to smile back but did not speak his mouth was exceptionally dry .Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Rons right .Her friend who had curly reddishblonde hair did not smile but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that given her way she would not be here at all .In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry Ron and Hermione some looking rather excited others curious Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space .When everybody had pulled up a chair the chatter died out .Every eye was upon Harry .Er said Hermione her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves .Well er hi .The group focused its attention on her instead though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry .Well .erm .well you know why youre here .Erm .well Harry here had the idea I mean Harry had thrown her a sharp look I had the idea that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts and I mean really study it you know not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us Hermiones voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts Hear hear said Anthony Goldstein and Hermione looked heartened well I thought it would be good if we well took matters into our own hands .She paused looked sideways at Harry and went on And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly not just theory but the real spells You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O .W .L .too though I bet ?said Michael Corner .Of course I do said Hermione at once .But I want more than that I want to be properly trained in Defense because .because .She took a great breath and finished Because Lord Voldemorts back .The reaction was immediate and predictable .Chos friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch Padma Patil shuddered and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough .All of them however looked fixedly even eagerly at Harry .Well .thats the plan anyway said Hermione .If you want to join us we need to decide how were going to Wheres the proof YouKnow Whos back ?said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice .Well Dumbledore believes it Hermione began .You mean Dumbledore believes him said the blond boy nodding at Harry .Who are you ?said Ron rather rudely .Zacharias Smith said the boy and I think weve got the right to know exactly what makes him say YouKnowWhos back .Look said Hermione intervening swiftly thats really not what this meeting was supposed to be about Its okay Hermione said Harry .It had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there .He felt that Hermione should have seen this coming .Some of these people maybe even most of them had turned up in the hope of hearing Harrys story firsthand .What makes me say YouKnowWhos back ?he asked looking Zacharias straight in the face .I saw him .But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year and if you didnt believe him you dont believe me and Im not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone .The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke .Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in .He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag it was becoming steadily dirtier .Zacharias said dismissively All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You KnowWho and that you brought Diggorys body back to Hogwarts .He didnt give us details he didnt tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered I think wed all like to know If youve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I cant help you Harry said .His temper always so close to the surface these days was rising again .He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smiths aggressive face determined not to look at Cho .I dont want to talk about Cedric Diggory all right ?So if thats what youre here for you might as well clear out .He cast an angry look in Hermiones direction .This was he felt all her fault she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was .But none of them left their seats not even Zacharias Smith though he continued to gaze intently at Harry .So said Hermione her voice very highpitched again .So .like I was saying .if you want to learn some defense then we need to work out how were going to do it how often were going to meet and where were going to Is it true interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back looking at Harry that you can produce a Patronus ?There was a murmur of interest around the group at this .Yeah said Harry slightly defensively .A corporeal Patronus ?The phrase stirred something in Harrys memory .Er you dont know Madam Bones do you ?he asked .The girl smiled .Shes my auntie she said .Im Susan Bones .She told me about your hearing .So is it really true ?You make a stag Patronus ?Yes said Harry .Blimey Harry !said Lee looking deeply impressed .I never knew that !Mum told Ron not to spread it around said Fred grinning at Harry .She said you got enough attention as it was .Shes not wrong mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed .The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat .And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledores office ?demanded Terry Boot .Thats what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year .Er yeah I did yeah said Harry .Justin FinchFletchley whistled the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said wow softly .Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho .And in our first year said Neville to the group at large he saved that Sorcerous Stone Sorcerers hissed Hermione .Yes that from YouKnowWho finished Neville .Hannah Abbotts eyes were as round as Galleons .And thats not to mention said Cho Harrys eyes snapped onto her she was looking at him smiling his stomach did another somersault all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things .There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table .Harrys insides were squirming .He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself .The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them .Look he said and everyone fell silent at once I .I dont want to sound like Im trying to be modest or anything but .I had a lot of help with all that stuff .Not with the dragon you didnt said Michael Corner at once .That was a seriously cool bit of flying .Yeah well said Harry feeling it would be churlish to disagree .And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer said Susan Bones .No said Harry no okay I know I did bits of it without help but the point Im trying to make is Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff ?said Zacharias Smith .Heres an idea said Ron loudly before Harry could speak why dont you shut your mouth ?Perhaps the word weasel had affected Ron particularly strongly in any case he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him .Zacharias flushed .Well weve all turned up to learn from him and now hes telling us he cant really do any of it he said .Thats not what he said snarled Fred Weasley .Would you like us to clean out your ears for you ?inquired George pulling a long and lethallooking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonkos bags .Or any part of your body really were not fussy where we stick this said Fred .Yes well said Hermione hastily moving on .the point is are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry ?There was a murmur of general agreement .Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Georges hand .Right said Hermione looking relieved that something had at last been settled .Well then the next question is how often we do it .I really dont think theres any point in meeting less than once a week Hang on said Angelina we need to make sure this doesnt clash with our Quidditch practice .No said Cho nor with ours .Nor ours added Zacharias Smith .Im sure we can find a night that suits everyone said Hermione slightly impatiently but you know this is rather important were talking about learning to defend ourselves against VVoldemorts Death Eaters Well said !barked Ernie Macmillan whom Harry had been expecting to speak long before this .Personally I think this is really important possibly more important than anything else well do this year even with our O .W .L .s coming up !He looked around impressively as though waiting for people to cry Surely not !When nobody spoke he went on I personally am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical period .Obviously they are in denial about the return of YouKnowWho but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells We think the reason Umbridge doesnt want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts said Hermione is that shes got some .some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army .She thinks hed mobilize us against the Ministry .Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news everybody except Luna Lovegood who piped up Well that makes sense .After all Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army .What ?said Harry completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information .Yes hes got an army of heliopaths said Luna solemnly .No he hasnt snapped Hermione .Yes he has said Luna .What are heliopaths ?asked Neville looking blank .Theyre spirits of fire said Luna her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever .Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of They dont exist Neville said Hermione tartly .Oh yes they do !said Luna angrily .Im sorry but wheres the proof of that ?snapped Hermione .There are plenty of eyewitness accounts just because youre so narrowminded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you Hem hem said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed .Werent we trying to decide how often were going to meet and get Defense lessons ?Yes said Hermione at once yes we were youre right .Well once a week sounds cool said Lee Jordan .As long as began Angelina .Yes yes we know about the Quidditch said Hermione in a tense voice .Well the other thing to decide is where were going to meet .This was rather more difficult the whole group fell silent .Library ?suggested Katie Bell after a few moments .I cant see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library said Harry .Maybe an unused classroom ?said Dean .Yeah said Ron McGonagall might let us have hers she did when Harry was practicing for the Tri wizard .But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time .For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious .Right well well try to find somewhere said Hermione .Well send a message round to everybody when weve got a time and a place for the first meeting .She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill then hesitated rather as though she was steeling herself to say something .II think everybody should write their name down just so we know who was here .But I also think she took a deep breath that we all ought to agree not to shout about what were doing .So if you sign youre agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what were up to .Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his signature but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list .Er .said Zacharias slowly not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass him .Well .Im sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is .But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too .Hermione raised her eyebrows at him .I well we are prefects Ernie burst out .And if this list was found .well I mean to say .you said yourself if Umbridge finds out .You just said this group was the most important thing youd do this year Harry reminded him .I yes said Ernie yes I do believe that its just Ernie do you really think Id leave that list lying around ?said Hermione testily .No .No of course not said Ernie looking slightly less anxious .I yes of course Ill sign .Nobody raised objections after Ernie though Harry saw Chos friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name .When the last person Zacharias had signed Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag .There was an odd feeling in the group now .It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract .Well times ticking on said Fred briskly getting to his feet .George Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase well be seeing you all later .In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too .Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face but her friend stood beside her arms folded clicking her tongue so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her .As her friend ushered her through the door Cho looked back and waved at Harry .Well I think that went quite well said Hermione happily as she Harry and Ron walked out of the Hogs Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of butterbeer .That Zacharias blokes a wart said Ron who was glowering after the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance .I dont like him much either admitted Hermione but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming so what could I say ?But the more people the better really I mean Michael Corner and his friends wouldnt have come if he hadnt been going out with Ginny Ron who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front .Hes WHAT ?said Ron outraged his ears now resembling curls of raw beef .Shes going out with my sisters going what dyou mean Michael Corner ?Well thats why he and his friends came I think well theyre obviously interested in learning defense but if Ginny hadnt told Michael what was going on When did this when did she ?They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last year said Hermione composedly .They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshafts Quill Shop where there was a handsome display of pheasantfeather quills in the window .Hmm .I could do with a new quill .She turned into the shop .Harry and Ron followed her .Which one was Michael Corner ?Ron demanded furiously .The dark one said Hermione .I didnt like him said Ron at once .Big surprise said Hermione under her breath .But said Ron following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots I thought Ginny fancied Harry !Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head .Ginny used to fancy Harry but she gave up on him months ago .Not that she doesnt like you of course she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long blackandgold quill .Harry whose head was still full of Chos parting wave did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron who was positively quivering with indignation but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered .So thats why she talks now ?he asked Hermione .She never used to talk in front of me .Exactly said Hermione .Yes I think Ill have this one .She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts Ron still breathing down her neck .Ron she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet this is exactly why Ginny hasnt told you shes seeing Michael she knew youd take it badly .So dont harp on about it for heavens sake .What dyou mean whos taking anything badly ?Im not going to harp on about anything .Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street .Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner And talking about Michael and Ginny .what about Cho and you ?What dyou mean ?said Harry quickly .It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold had he been that obvious ?Well said Hermione smiling slightly she just couldnt keep her eyes off you could she ?Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was .EDUCATIONAL DECREE NUMBER TWENTYFOUR Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term .He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again and although this could hardly be called fun the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake .Hermione who of course was up to date with all her work brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her producing more hats and scarves .The knowledge that they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry and that he was a key part of the rebellion gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction .He kept reliving Saturdays meeting in his mind all those people coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts .and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done .and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament .The knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo but someone to be admired buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes .He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together discussing Angelinas idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that nights Quidditch practice and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people .A large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board so large that it covered everything else on there the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch the Quidditch team training schedule the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog cards for others the Weasleys new advertisement for testers the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends and the lostandfound notices .The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly officiallooking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature .BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS All Student Organizations Societies Teams Groups and Clubs are henceforth disbanded .An Organization Society Team Group or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students .Permission to reform may be sought from the High Inquisitor Professor Umbridge .No Student Organization Society Team Group or Club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor .Any student found to have formed or to belong to an Organization Society Team Group or Club that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled .The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twentyfour .Signed Dolores Jane Umbridge HIGH INQUISITOR Harry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxiouslooking second years .Does this mean theyre going to shut down the Gobstones Club ?one of them asked his friend .I reckon youll be okay with Gobstones Ron said darkly making the second year jump .I dont think were going to be as lucky though do you ?he asked Harry as the second years hurried away .Harry was reading the notice through again .The happiness that had filled him since Saturday was gone .His insides were pulsing with rage .This isnt a coincidence he said his hands forming fists .She knows .She cant said Ron at once .There were people listening in that pub .And lets face it we dont know how many of the people who turned up we can trust .Any of them could have run off and told Umbridge .And he had thought they believed him thought they even admired him .Zacharias Smith !said Ron at once punching a fist into his hand .Or I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too I wonder if Hermiones seen this yet ?Harry said looking around at the door to the girls dormitories .Lets go and tell her said Ron .He bounded forward pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase .He was on the sixth stair when it happened .There was a loud wailing klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long smooth stone slide .There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running arms working madly like windmills then he toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide coming to rest on his back at Harrys feet .Er I dont think were allowed in the girls dormitories said Harry pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh .Two fourthyear girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide .Oooh who tried to get upstairs ?they giggled happily leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron .Me said Ron who was still rather disheveled .I didnt realize that would happen .Its not fair !he added to Harry as the girls headed off for the portrait hole still giggling madly .Hermiones allowed in our dormitory how come were not allowed ?Well its an oldfashioned rule said Hermione who had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet but it says in Hogwarts A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls .Anyway why were you trying to get in there ?To see you look at this !said Ron dragging her over to the notice board .Hermiones eyes slid rapidly down the notice .Her expression became stony .Someone must have blabbed to her !Ron said angrily .They cant have done said Hermione in a low voice .Youre so naive said Ron you think just because youre all honorable and trustworthy No they cant have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed said Hermione grimly .Believe me if anyones run off and told Umbridge well know exactly who they are and they will really regret it .Whatll happen to them ?said Ron eagerly .Well put it this way said Hermione itll make Eloise Midgens acne look like a couple of cute freckles .Come on lets get down to breakfast and see what the others think .I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses ?It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridges sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower .There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read .Harry Ron and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville Dean Fred George and Ginny descended upon them .Did you see it ?Dyou reckon she knows ?What are we going to do ?They were all looking at Harry .He glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them .Were going to do it anyway of course he said quietly .Knew youd say that said George beaming and thumping Harry on the arm .The prefects as well ?said Fred looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione .Of course said Hermione coolly .Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott said Ron looking over his shoulder .And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith .and no one looks very spotty .Hermione looked alarmed .Never mind spots the idiots cant come over here now itll look really suspicious sit down !she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table .Later !Well talk to you lateri Ill tell Michael said Ginny impatiently swinging herself off her bench .The fool honestly .She hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table Harry watched her go .Cho was sitting not far away talking to the curlyhaired friend she had brought along to the Hogs Head .Would Umbridges notice scare her off meeting them again ?But the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic .Harry !Ron It was Angelina and she was hurrying toward them looking perfectly desperate .Its okay said Harry quietly when she was near enough to hear him .Were still going to You realize shes including Quidditch in this ?Angelina said over him .We have to go and ask permission to reform the Gryffindor team !What ?said Harry .No way said Ron appalled .You read the sign it mentions teams too !So listen Harry .I am saying this for the last time .Please please dont lose your temper with Umbridge again or she might not let us play anymore !Okay okay said Harry for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears .Dont worry Ill behave myself .Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic said Ron grimly as they set off for Binnss lesson .She hasnt inspected Binns yet .Bet you anything shes there .But he was wrong the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars .Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermiones frequent glares and nudges until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily .What ?She pointed at the window .Harry looked around .Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge gazing through the thick glass at him a letter tied to her leg .Harry could not understand it they had just had breakfast why on earth hadnt she delivered the letter then as usual ?Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other too .Oh Ive always loved that owl shes so beautiful Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati .He glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes serenely unaware that the classs attention was even less focused upon him than usual .Harry slipped quietly off his chair crouched down and hurried along the row to the window where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly .He had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside hooting dolefully .He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns crouched low again and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder .He regained his seat transferred Hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg .It was only then that he realized that Hedwigs feathers were oddly ruffled some were bent the wrong way and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle .Shes hurt !Harry whispered bending his head low over her .Hermione and Ron leaned in closer Hermione even put down her quill .Look theres something wrong with her wing Hedwig was quivering when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself and gazed at him reproachfully .Professor Binns said Harry loudly and everyone in the class turned to look at him .Im not feeling well .Professor Binns raised his eyes from his notes looking amazed as always to find the room in front of him full of people .Not feeling well ?he repeated hazily .Not at all well said Harry firmly getting to his feet while concealing Hedwig behind his back .So I think Ill need to go to the hospital wing .Yes said Professor Binns clearly very much wrong footed .Yes .yes hospital wing .well off you go then Perkins .Once outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binnss door .His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid of course but as he had no idea where Hagrid was his only remaining option was to find Professor GrubblyPlank and hope she would help .He peered out of a window at the blustery overcast grounds .There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrids cabin if she was not teaching she was probably in the staffroom .He set off downstairs Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder .Two stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door .As Harry approached one of them croaked You should be in class sunny Jim .This is urgent said Harry curtly .Ooooh urgent is it ?said the other gargoyle in a highpitched voice .Well thats put us in our place hasnt it ?Harry knocked he heard footsteps and then the door opened and he found himself facetoface with Professor McGonagall .You havent been given another detention !she said at once her square spectacles flashing alarmingly .No Professor !said Harry hastily .Well then why are you out of class ?Its urgent apparently said the second gargoyle snidely .Im looking for Professor GrubblyPlank Harry explained .Its my owl shes injured .Injured owl did you say ?Professor GrubblyPlank appeared at Professor McGonagalls shoulder smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet Yes said Harry lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder she turned up after the other post owls and her wings all funny look Professor GrubblyPlank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched .Hmm said Professor GrubblyPlank her pipe waggling slightly as she talked .Looks like somethings attacked her .Cant think what would have done it though .Thestrals will sometimes go for birds of course but Hagrids got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls .Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right .Professor McGonagall however looked sharply at Harry and said Do you know how far this owls traveled Potter ?Er said Harry .From London I think .He met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood London to mean number twelve Grimmauld Place by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle .Professor GrubblyPlank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwigs wing closely .I should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me Potter she said .She shouldnt be flying long distances for a few days in any case .Er right thanks said Harry just as the bell rang for break .No problem said Professor GrubblyPlank gruffly turning back into the staffroom .Just a moment Wilhelmina !said Professor McGonagall .Potters letter !Oh yeah !said Harry who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwigs leg .Professor GrubblyPlank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this .Feeling slightly guilty he turned to go but Professor McGonagall called him back .Potter !Yes Professor ?She glanced up and down the corridor there were students coming from both directions .Bear in mind she said quickly and quietly her eyes on the scroll in his hand that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched wont you ?I said Harry but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him .Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd .Here he spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner their cloak collars turned up against the wind .Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them and found five words in Siriuss handwriting Today same time same place .Is Hedwig okay ?asked Hermione anxiously the moment he was within earshot .Where did you take her ?asked Ron .To GrubblyPlank said Harry .And I met McGonagall .Listen .And he told them what Professor McGonagall had said .To his surprise neither of the others looked shocked on the contrary they exchanged significant looks .What ?said Harry looking from Ron to Hermione and back again .Well I was just saying to Ron .what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig ?I mean shes never been hurt on a flight before has she ?Whos the letter from anyway ?asked Ron taking the note from Harry .Snuffles said Harry quietly . ‘Same time same place ?Does he mean the fire in the common room ?Obviously said Hermione also reading the note .She looked uneasy .I just hope nobody else has read this .But it was still sealed and everything said Harry trying to convince himself as much as her .And nobody would understand what it meant if they didnt know where wed spoken to him before would they ?I dont know said Hermione anxiously hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again .It wouldnt be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic .And if anyones watching the Floo Network .but I dont really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too !They trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions all three of them lost in thought but as they reached the bottom of the stairs they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy who was standing just outside Snapes classroom door waving around an officiallooking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word .Yeah Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway I went to ask her first thing this morning .Well it was pretty much automatic I mean she knows my father really well hes always popping in and out of the Ministry .Itll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing wont it ?Dont rise Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron who were both watching Malfoy faces set and fists clenched .Its what he wants .I mean said Malfoy raising his voice a little more his gray eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Rons direction if its a question of influence with the Ministry I dont think theyve got much chance .From what my father says theyve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years .And as for Potter .My father says its a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St .Mungos .apparently theyve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic .Malfoy made a grotesque face his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling .Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee .Something collided hard with Harrys shoulder knocking him sideways .A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged past him heading straight for Malfoy .Neville no !Harry leapt forward and seized the back of Nevilles robes Neville struggled frantically his fists flailing trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked for a moment extremely shocked .Help me !Harry flung at Ron managing to get an arm around Nevilles neck and dragging him backward away from the Slytherins .Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing their arms closing in front of Malfoy ready for the fight .Ron hurried forward and seized Nevilles arms together he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line .Nevilles face was scarlet the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible but odd words spluttered from his mouth .Not .funny .dont .Mungos .show .him .The dungeon door opened .Snape appeared there .His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville .Fighting Potter Weasley Longbottom ?Snape said in his cold sneering voice .Ten points from Gryffindor .Release Longbottom Potter or it will be detention .Inside all of you .Harry let go of Neville who stood panting and glaring at him .I had to stop you Harry gasped picking up his bag .Crabbe and Goyle wouldve torn you apart .Neville said nothing he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon .What in the name of Merlin said Ron slowly as they followed Neville was that about ?Harry did not answer .He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St .Mungos because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Nevilles secret .Even Neville did not know that Harry knew .Harry Ron and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class and pulled out parchment quills and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi .The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately .You will notice said Snape in his low sneering voice that we have a guest with us today .He gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there clipboard on her knee .He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione his eyebrows raised .Snape and Umbridge the two teachers he hated most .it was hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other .We are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions today you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend instructions he waved his wand again on the board .Carry on .Professor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner .Harry was very interested in hearing her question Snape so interested that he was becoming careless with his potion again .Salamander blood Harry !Hermione moaned grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time .Not pomegranate juice !Right said Harry vaguely putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner .Umbridge had just gotten to her feet .Ha he said softly as she strode between two lines of desks toward Snape who was bending over Dean Thomass cauldron .Well the class seems fairly advanced for their level she said briskly to Snape s back .Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution .I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus .Snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her .Now .how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts ?she asked her quill poised over her clipboard .Fourteen years Snape replied .His expression was unfathomable .His eyes on Snape Harry added a few drops to his potion it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange .You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post I believe ?Professor Umbridge asked Snape .Yes said Snape quietly .But you were unsuccessful ?Snape s lip curled .Obviously .Professor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard .And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school I believe ?Yes said Snape quietly barely moving his lips .He looked very angry .Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you ?asked Umbridge .I suggest you ask him said Snape jerkily .Oh I shall said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile .I suppose this is relevant ?Snape asked his black eyes narrowed .Oh yes said Professor Umbridge .Yes the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers er backgrounds .She turned away walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons .Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes met for a second .Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber .No marks again then Potter said Snape maliciously emptying Harrys cauldron with a wave of his wand .You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion indicating how and why you went wrong to be handed in next lesson do you understand ?Yes said Harry furiously .Snape had already given them homework and he had Quidditch practice this evening this would mean another couple of sleepless nights .It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy .All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end as soon as possible .Maybe Ill skive off Divination he said glumly as they stood again in the courtyard after lunch the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats .Ill pretend to be ill and do Snapes essay instead then I wont have to stay up half the night .You cant skive off Divination said Hermione severely .Hark whos talking you walked out of Divination you hate Trelawney !said Ron indignantly .I dont hate her said Hermione loftily .I just think shes an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud .But Harrys already missed History of Magic and I dont think he ought to miss anything else today !There was too much truth in this to ignore so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot over perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody .Professor Trelawney was handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet again he would surely be much better employed doing Snapes punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of madeup dreams .It seemed however that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper .Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away her lips pursed she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean narrowly avoiding Seamuss head and thrust the final one into Nevilles chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf .Well carry on !said Professor Trelawney loudly her voice high pitched and somewhat hysterical .You know what to do !Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book ?The class stared perplexedly at her and then at each other .Harry however thought he knew what was the matter .As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the highbacked teachers chair her magnified eyes full of angry tears he leaned his head closer to Rons and muttered I think shes got the results of her inspection back .Professor ?said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney .Professor is there anything er wrong ?Wrong !cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion .Certainly not !I have been insulted certainly .Insinuations have been made against me .Unfounded accusations levelled .but no there is nothing wrong certainly not .She took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati angry tears spilling from under her glasses .I say nothing she choked of sixteen years devoted service .It has passed apparently unnoticed .But I shall not be insulted no I shall not !But Professor whos insulting you ?asked Parvati timidly .The establishment !said Professor Trelawney in a deep dramatic wavering voice .Yes those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See to Know as I Know .Of course we Seers have always been feared always persecuted .It is alas our fate .She gulped dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl and then pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve into which she blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry .Ron sniggered .Lavender shot him a disgusted look .Professor said Parvati do you mean .is it something Professor Umbridge . ?Do not speak to me about that woman !cried Professor Trelawney leaping to her feet her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing .Kindly continue with your work !And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them tears still leaking from behind her glasses muttering what sounded like threats under her breath . .may well choose to leave .the indignity of it .on probation .we shall see .how she dares .You and Umbridge have got something in common Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts .She obviously reckons Trelawneys an old fraud too .Looks like shes put her on probation .Umbridge entered the room as he spoke wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness .Good afternoon class .Good afternoon Professor Umbridge they chanted drearily .Wands away please .But there was no answering flurry of movement this time nobody had bothered to take out their wands .Please turn to page thirtyfour of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter entitled The Case for NonOffensive Responses to Magical Attack .There will be no need to talk Harry Ron and Hermione said together under their breaths .No Quidditch practice said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry Ron and Hermione entered the common room that night after dinner .But I kept my temper !said Harry horrified .I didnt say anything to her Angelina I swear I I know I know said Angelina miserably .She just said she needed a bit of time to consider .Consider what ?said Ron angrily .Shes given the Slytherins permission why not us ?But Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon .Well said Hermione look on the bright side at least now youll have time to do Snapes essay !Thats a bright side is it ?snapped Harry while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione .No Quidditch practice and extra Potions ?Harry slumped down into a chair dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work .It was very hard to concentrate even though he knew that Sirius was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case .There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd .First Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them .Then he would force down the purple end of the chew at which the vomiting would immediately cease .Lee Jordan who was assisting the demonstration was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harrys potions .What with the regular sounds of retching cheering and Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solutions .Hermione was not helping matters the cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and Georges bucket were punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found if anything more distracting .Just go and stop them then !he said irritably after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time .I cant theyre not technically doing anything wrong said Hermione through gritted teeth .Theyre quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and I cant find a rule that says the other idiots arent entitled to buy them not unless theyre proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesnt look as though they are .She Harry and Ron watched George projectilevomit into the bucket gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause .You know I dont get why Fred and George only got three O .W .L .s each said Harry watching as Fred George and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd .They really know their stuff .Oh they only know flashy stuff thats no real use to anyone said Hermione disparagingly .No real use ?said Ron in a strained voice .Hermione theyve got about twentysix Galleons already .It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed and then Fred Lee and George sat up counting their takings even longer so that it was well past midnight when Harry Ron and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves again .At long last Fred closed the doorway to the boys dormitories behind him rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled .Harry who was making very little progress with his Potions essay decided to give it up for the night .As he put his books away Ron who was dozing lightly in an armchair gave a muffled grunt awoke looked blearily into the fire and said Sirius !Harry whipped around Siriuss untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again .Hi he said grinning .Hi chorused Harry Ron and Hermione all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug .Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire trying despite the heat to put his face close to Siriuss .Howre things ?said Sirius .Not that good said Harry as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers .The Ministrys forced through another decree which means were not allowed to have Quidditch teams or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups ?said Sirius .There was a short pause .How did you know about that ?Harry demanded .You want to choose your meeting places more carefully said Sirius grinning still more broadly .The Hogs Head I ask you .Well it was better than the Three Broomsticks !said Hermione defensively .Thats always packed with people which means youd have been harder to overhear said Sirius .Youve got a lot to learn Hermione .Who overheard us ?Harry demanded .Mundungus of course said Sirius and when they all looked puzzled he laughed .He was the witch under the veil .That was Mundungus ?Harry said stunned .What was he doing in the Hogs Head ?What do you think he was doing ?said Sirius impatiently .Keeping an eye on you of course .Im still being followed ?asked Harry angrily .Yeah you are said Sirius and just as well isnt it if the first thing youre going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group .But he looked neither angry nor worried on the contrary he was looking at Harry with distinct pride .Why was Dung hiding from us ?asked Ron sounding disappointed .Wedve liked tove seen him .He was banned from the Hogs Head twenty years ago said Sirius and that barmans got a long memory .We lost Moodys spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested so Dungs been dressing as a witch a lot lately .Anyway .First of all Ron Ive sworn to pass on a message from your mother .Oh yeah ?said Ron sounding apprehensive .She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group .She says youll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined .She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now .She also Siriuss eyes turned to the other two advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart .She would have written all this to you but if the owl had been intercepted youd all have been in real trouble and she cant say it for herself because shes on duty tonight .On duty doing what ?said Ron quickly .Never you mind just stuff for the Order said Sirius .So its fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on because I dont think she trusts me to .There was another pause in which Crookshanks mewing attempted to paw Siriuss head and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug .So you want me to say Im not going to take part in the defense group ?he muttered finally .Me ?Certainly not !said Sirius looking surprised .I think its an excellent idea !You do ?said Harry his heart lifting .Of course I do !said Sirius .Dyou think your father and I wouldve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge ?But last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you Harry !said Sirius impatiently .This year we know that theres someone outside Hogwarts whod like to kill us all so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea !And if we do get expelled ?Hermione asked a quizzical look on her face .Hermione this whole thing was your idea !said Harry staring at her .I know it was .I just wondered what Sirius thought she said shrugging .Well better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue said Sirius .Hear hear said Harry and Ron enthusiastically .So said Sirius how are you organizing this group ?Where are you meeting ?Well thats a bit of a problem now said Harry .Dunno where were going to be able to go .How about the Shrieking Shack ?suggested Sirius .Hey thats an idea !said Ron excitedly but Hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at her Siriuss head turning in the flames .Well Sirius its just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school said Hermione and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if youd wanted to .But there are twentyeight of us and none of us is an Animagus so we wouldnt need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee Fair point said Sirius looking slightly crestfallen .Well Im sure youll come up with somewhere .There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there Fred and George told me its blocked said Harry shaking his head .Caved in or something .Oh .said Sirius frowning .Well 111 have a think and get back to He broke off .His face was suddenly tense alarmed .He turned sideways apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace .Sirius ?said Harry anxiously .But he had vanished .Harry gaped at the flames for a moment then turned to look at Ron and Hermione .Why did he ?Hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet still staring at the fire .A hand had appeared amongst the flames groping as though to catch hold of something a stubby short fingered hand covered in ugly oldfashioned rings .The three of them ran for it at the door of the boys dormitory Harry looked back .Umbridges hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames as though she knew exactly where Siriuss hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it .DUMBLEDORES ARMY Umbridge has been reading your mail Harry .Theres no other explanation .You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig ?he said outraged .Im almost certain of it said Hermione grimly .Watch your frog its escaping .Harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table Acciol and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand .Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat There was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight .Today with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows Harry Ron and Hermione s whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed .Ive been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs because it seemed such a stupid lie Hermione whispered .I mean once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you werent ordering them so you wouldnt have been in trouble at all its a bit of a feeble joke isnt it ?But then I thought what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail ?Well then it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it tip off Filch let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it I dont think Filch would object whens he ever stuck up for a students rights ?Harry youre squashing your frog .Harry looked down he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping he replaced it hastily upon the desk .It was a very very close call last night said Hermione .I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was .Silenciol The bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was struck dumb midcroak and glared at her reproachfully .If shed caught Snuffles .Harry finished the sentence for her .Hed probably be back in Azkaban this morning .He waved his wand without really concentrating his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a highpitched whistle .Silenciol said Hermione hastily pointing her wand at Harrys frog which deflated silently before them .Well he mustnt do it again thats all .I just dont know how were going to let him know .We cant send him an owl .I dont reckon hell risk it again said Ron .Hes not stupid he knows she nearly got him .Silenciol The large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw .Silenciol SILENCIO The raven cawed more loudly .Its the way youre moving your wand said Hermione watching Ron critically .You dont want to wave it its more a sharp jab .Ravens are harder than frogs said Ron testily .Fine lets swap said Hermione seizing Rons raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog .Silencio The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak but no sound came out .Very good Miss Granger !said Professor Flitwicks squeaky little voice and Harry Ron and Hermione all jumped .Now let me see you try Mr Weasley !Wha ?Oh oh right said Ron very flustered .Er Silenciol He jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk .It came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework .They were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside .They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebodys head .They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling toward them through the groups of gossiping students .Ive got permission !she said .To reform the Quidditch team !Excellent .said Ron and Harry together .Yeah said Angelina beaming .I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore anyway Umbridge had to give in .Ha !So I want you down at the pitch at seven oclock tonight all right because weve got to make up time you realize were only three weeks away from our first match ?She squeezed away from them narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves which hit a nearby first year instead and vanished from sight .Rons smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window which was now opaque with hammering rain .Hope this clears up .Whats up with you Hermione ?She too was gazing at the window but not as though she really saw it .Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face .Just thinking .she said still frowning at the rain washed window .About Siri .Snuffles ?said Harry .No .not exactly .said Hermione slowly .More .wondering .I suppose were doing the right thing .I think .arent we ?Harry and Ron looked at each other .Well that clears that up said Ron .It wouldve been really annoying if you hadnt explained yourself properly .Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he was there .I was just wondering she said her voice stronger now whether were doing the right thing starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group .What !said Harry and Ron together .Hermione it was your idea in the first place !said Ron indignantly .I know said Hermione twisting her fingers together .But after talking to Snuffles .But hes all for it !said Harry .Yes said Hermione staring at the window again .Yes thats what made me think maybe it wasnt a good idea after all .Peeves floated over them on his stomach peashooter at the ready automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed .Lets get this straight said Harry angrily as they put their bags back on the floor Sirius agrees with us so you dont think we should do it anymore ?Hermione looked tense and rather miserable .Now staring at her own hands she said Do you honestly trust his judgment ?Yes I do !said Harry at once .Hes always given us great advice !An ink pellet whizzed past them striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear .Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully .You dont think he has become .sort of .reckless .since hes been cooped up in Grimmauld Place ?You dont think hes .kind of .living through us ?What dyou mean ‘living through us ?Harry retorted .I mean .well I think hed love to be forming secret defense societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry .I think hes really frustrated at how little he can do where he is .so I think hes keen to kind of .egg us on .Ron looked utterly perplexed .Sirius is right he said you do sound just like my mother .Hermione bit her lip and did not answer .The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down upon Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head .The weather did not improve as the day wore on so that at seven oclock that evening when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice they were soaked through within minutes their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass .The sky was a deep thundery gray and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms even if they knew the respite was only temporary .They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying .but I bet shed know what wed done Fred said out of the corner of his mouth .If only I hadnt offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday We could try the Fever Fudge George muttered no ones seen that yet Does it work ?inquired Ron hopefully as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building .Well yeah said Fred your temperaturell go right up but you get these massive pusfilled boils too said George and we havent worked out how to get rid of them yet .I cant see any boils said Ron staring at the twins .No well you wouldnt said Fred darkly theyre not in a place we generally display to the public but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the All right everyone listen up said Angelina loudly emerging from the Captains office .I know its not ideal weather but theres a good chance well be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so its a good idea to work out how were going to cope with them .Harry didnt you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm ?Hermione did it said Harry .He pulled out his wand tapped his glasses and said Imperviusl I think we all ought to try that said Angelina .If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility all together come on Imperviusl Okay .Lets go .They all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes shouldered their brooms and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms .They squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds .All right on my whistle shouted Angelina .Harry kicked off from the ground spraying mud in all directions and shot upward the wind pulling him slightly off course .He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it .Unfortunately Angelina did not see this in fact she did not appear to be able to see anything none of them had a clue what the others were doing .The wind was picking up even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing pounding sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake .Angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat .She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time though without any real conviction in her voice .Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed both were bandylegged and winced with every movement .Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he toweled his hair dry .I think a few of mine have ruptured said Fred in a hollow voice .Mine havent said George wincing .Theyre throbbing like mad .feel bigger if anything .OUCH !said Harry .He pressed the towel to his face his eyes screwed tight with pain .The scar on his forehead had seared again more painfully than in months .Whats up ?said several voices .Harry emerged from behind his towel the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses but he could still tell that everyones face was turned toward him .Nothing he muttered I poked myself in the eye thats all .But he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside muffled in their cloaks their hats pulled low over their ears .What happened ?said Ron the moment that Alicia had disappeared through the door .Was it your scar ?Harry nodded .But .Looking scared Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain He he cant be near us now can he ?No Harry muttered sinking onto a bench and rubbing his forehead .Hes probably miles away .It hurt because .hes .angry .Harry had not meant to say that at all and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them yet he knew at once that they were true .He did not know how he knew it but he did Voldemort wherever he was whatever he was doing was in a towering temper .Did you see him ?said Ron looking horrified .Did you .get a vision or something ?Harry sat quite still staring at his feet allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain .A confused tangle of shapes a howling rush of voices He wants something done and its not happening fast enough he said .Again he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth and yet quite certain that they were true .But .how do you know ?said Ron .Harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands pressing down upon them with his palms .Little stars erupted in them .He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him .Is this what it was about last time ?said Ron in a hushed voice .When your scar hurt in Umbridges office ?YouKnowWho was angry ?Harry shook his head .What is it then ?Harry was thinking himself back .He had been looking into Umbridges face .His scar had hurt .and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach .a strange leaping feeling .a happy feeling .But of course he had not recognized it for what it was as he had been feeling so miserable himself .Last time it was because he was pleased he said .Really pleased .He thought .something good was going to happen .And the night before we came back to Hogwarts .He thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Rons bedroom in Grimmauld Place .He was furious .He looked around at Ron who was gaping at him .You could take over from Trelawney mate he said in an awed voice .Im not making prophecies said Harry .No you know what youre doing ?Ron said sounding both scared and impressed .Harry youre reading YouKnowWhos mind .No said Harry shaking his head .Its more like .his mood I suppose .Im just getting flashes of what mood hes in .Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year .He said that when Voldemort was near me or when he was feeling hatred I could tell .Well now Im feeling it when hes pleased too .There was a pause .The wind and rain lashed at the building .Youve got to tell someone said Ron .I told Sirius last time .Well tell him about this time !Cant can I ?said Harry grimly .Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires remember ?Well then Dumbledore Ive just told you he already knows said Harry shortly getting to his feet taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around himself .Theres no point telling him again .Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak watching Harry thoughtfully .Dumbledored want to know he said .Harry shrugged .Cmon .weve still got Silencing Charms to practice They hurried back through the dark grounds sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns not talking .Harry was thinking hard .What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough ?Hes got other plans .plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed .stuff he can only get by stealth .like a weapon .Something he didnt have last time .He had not thought about those words in weeks he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge the injustice of all the Ministry interference .But now they came back to him and made him wonder .Voldemorts anger would make sense if he was no nearer laying hands on the weapon whatever it was .Had the Order thwarted him stopped him from seizing it ?Where was it kept ?Who had it now ?Mimbulus mimbletonia said Rons voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room .It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire .Harry was rather grateful that she was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore too .Ron kept throwing him anxious glances but Harry pulled out his Potions book and set to work to finish his essay though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time that Ron said he was going to bed too had written hardly anything .Midnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvygrass lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it .These plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts where the wizard is desirous of producing hotheadedness and recklessness . .Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place . .moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used . .the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that he knew what Voldemort was feeling . .therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts . .confusing was the word all right why did he know what Voldemort was feeling ?What was this weird connection between them which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily ? .where the wizard is desirous . .how he would like to sleep . .of producing hotheadedness ..It was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flames .The book slipped from Harrys slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug .His head fell sideways .He was walking once more along a windowless corridor his footsteps echoing in the silence .As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement .If he could only open it .enter beyond .He stretched out his hand .His fingertips were inches from it .Harry Potter sir !He awoke with a start .The candles had all been extinguished in the common room but there was something moving close by .Whozair ?said Harry sitting upright in his chair .The fire was almost extinguished the room very dark .Dobby has your owl sir !said a squeaky voice .Dobby ?said Harry thickly peering through the gloom toward the source of the voice .Dobby the houseelf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats .His large pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats that Hermione had ever knitted he was wearing one on top of the other so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig hooting serenely and obviously cured .Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potters owl !said the elf squeakily with a look of positive adoration on his face .Professor GrubblyPlank says she is all well now sir !He sank into a deep bow so that his pencillike nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered onto the arm of Harrys chair .Thanks Dobby !said Harry stroking Hedwigs head and blinking hard trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream .It had been very vivid .Looking back at Dobby he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks so that his feet looked far too big for his body .Er .have you been taking all the clothes Hermiones been leaving out ?Oh no sir said Dobby happily Dobby has been taking some for Winky too sir .Yeah how is Winky ?asked Harry .Dobbys ears drooped slightly .Winky is still drinking lots sir he said sadly his enormous round green eyes large as tennis balls downcast .She still does not care for clothes Harry Potter .Nor do the other houseelves .None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere they finds them insulting sir .Dobby does it all himself sir but Dobby does not mind sir for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight sir he has got his wish !Dobby sank into a deep bow again .But Harry Potter does not seem happy Dobby went on straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry .Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep .Was Harry Potter having bad dreams ?Not really bad said Harry yawning and rubbing his eyes .Ive had worse .The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast orblike eyes .Then he said very seriously his ears drooping Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much much happier now .Harry smiled .You cant help me Dobby but thanks for the offer .He bent and picked up his Potions book .Hed have to try and finish the essay tomorrow .He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand the result of his detention with Umbridge .Wait a moment there is something you can do for me Dobby said Harry slowly .The elf looked around beaming .Name it Harry Potter sir !I need to find a place where twentyeight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers .Especially Harry clenched his hand on the book so that the scars shone pearly white Professor Umbridge .He expected the elfs smile to vanish his ears to droop he expected him to say that this was impossible or else that he would try but his hopes were not high .What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip his ears waggling happily and clap his hands together .Dobby knows the perfect place sir !he said happily .Dobby heard tell of it from the other houseelves when he came to Hogwarts sir .It is known by us as the Come and Go Room sir or else as the Room of Requirement !Why ?said Harry curiously .Because it is a room that a person can only enter said Dobby seriously when they have real need of it .Sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not but when it appears it is always equipped for the seekers needs .Dobby has used it sir said the elf dropping his voice and looking guilty when Winky has been very drunk .He has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there and a nice elfsized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off sir .And Dobby knows Mr Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short sir and and if you really needed a bathroom said Harry suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas would it fill itself with chamber pots ?Dobby expects so sir said Dobby nodding earnestly .It is a most amazing room sir .How many people know about it ?said Harry sitting up straighter in his chair .Very few sir .Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it sir but often they never finds it again for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service sir .It sounds brilliant said Harry his heart racing .It sounds perfect Dobby .When can you show me where it is ?Anytime Harry Potter sir said Dobby looking delighted at Harrys enthusiasm .We could go now if you like !For a moment Harry was tempted to go now he was halfway out of his seat intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when not for the first time a voice very much like Hermiones whispered in his ear reckless .It was after all very late he was exhausted and had Snapes essay to finish .Not tonight Dobby said Harry reluctantly sinking back into his chair .This is really important .I dont want to blow it itll need proper planning .Listen can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there ?Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof .The afternoons Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the stormswept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and to their intense relief Angelina sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was canceled .Good said Harry quietly when she told him because weve found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting .Tonight eight oclock seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls .Can you tell Katie and Alicia ?She looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash .When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice he found Hermione watching him .What ?he said thickly .Well .its just that Dobbys plans arent always that safe .Dont you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm ?This room isnt just some mad idea of Dobbys Dumbledore knows about it too he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball .Hermiones expression cleared .Dumbledore told you about it ?Just in passing said Harry shrugging .Oh well thats all right then said Hermione briskly and she raised no more objections .Together with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hogs Head and telling them where to meet that evening .Somewhat to Harrys disappointment it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first however by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twentyfive people who had turned up in the Hogs Head .At halfpast seven Harry Ron and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand .Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine oclock but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way up to the seventh floor .Hold it said Harry warningly unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase tapping it with his wand and muttering I solemnly swear that I am up to no good .A map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment .Tiny black moving dots labeled with names showed where various people were .Filch is on the second floor said Harry holding the map close to his eyes and scanning it closely and Mrs Norris is on the fourth .And Umbridge ?said Hermione anxiously .In her office said Harry pointing .Okay lets go .They hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmys foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet .Okay said Harry quietly while a motheaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the wouldbe ballet teacher to watch .Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times concentrating hard on what we need .They did so turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall then at the mansize vase on its other side .Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration Hermione was whispering something under her breath Harrys fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him .We need somewhere to learn to fight .he thought .Just give us a place to practice .somewhere they cant find us .Harry said Hermione sharply as they wheeled around after their third walk past .A highly polished door had appeared in the wall .Ron was staring at it looking slightly wary .Harry reached out seized the brass handle pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below .The walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor .A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes Secrecy Sensors and a large cracked FoeGlass that Harry was sure had hung the previous year in the fake Moodys office .These will be good when were practicing Stunning said Ron enthusiastically prodding one of the cushions with his foot .And just look at these books !said Hermione excitedly running a finger along the spines of the large leatherbound tomes .A Compendium of Common Curses and Their CounterActions .The Dark Arts Outsmarted .SelfDefensive Spellwork .wow .She looked around at Harry her face glowing and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right .Harry this is wonderful theres everything we need here !And without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf sank onto the nearest cushion and began to read .There was a gentle knock on the door .Harry looked around Ginny Neville Lavender Parvati and Dean had arrived .Whoa said Dean staring around impressed .What is this place ?Harry began to explain but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again .By the time eight oclock arrived every cushion was occupied .Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent looking at him .Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside .Well said Harry slightly nervously .This is the place weve found for practices and youve er obviously found it okay Its fantastic !said Cho and several people murmured their agreement .Its bizarre said Fred frowning around at it .We once hid from Filch in here remember George ?But it was just a broom cupboard then .Hey Harry whats this stuff ?asked Dean from the rear of the room indicating the Sneakoscopes and the FoeGlass .Dark Detectors said Harry stepping between the cushions to reach them .Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around but you dont want to rely on them too much they can be fooled .He gazed for a moment into the cracked FoeGlass shadowy figures were moving around inside it though none was recognizable .He turned his back on it .Well Ive been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and er He noticed a raised hand .What Hermione ?I think we ought to elect a leader said Hermione .Harrys leader said Cho at once looking at Hermione as though she were mad and Harrys stomach did yet another back flip .Yes but I think we ought to vote on it properly said Hermione unperturbed .It makes it formal and it gives him authority .So everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader ?Everybody put up their hands even Zacharias Smith though he did it very halfheartedly .Er right thanks said Harry who could feel his face burning .And what Hermione ?I also think we ought to have a name she said brightly her hand still in the air .It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity dont you think ?Can we be the AntiUmbridge League ?said Angelina hopefully .Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group ?suggested Fred .I was thinking said Hermione frowning at Fred more of a name that didnt tell everyone what we were up to so we can refer to it safely outside meetings .The Defense Association ?said Cho .The D .A .for short so nobody knows what were talking about ?Yeah the D .A .s good said Ginny .Only lets make it stand for Dumbledores Army because thats the Ministrys worst fear isnt it ?There was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this .All in favor of the D .A .said Hermione bossily kneeling up on her cushion to count .Thats a majority motion passed !She pinned the piece of paper with all of their names on it on the wall and wrote DUMBLEDORES ARMY across the top in large letters .Right said Harry when she had sat down again shall we get practicing then ?I was thinking the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus you know the Disarming Charm .I know its pretty basic but Ive found it really useful Oh please said Zacharias Smith rolling his eyes and folding his arms .I dont think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against YouKnowWho do you ?Ive used it against him said Harry quietly .It saved my life last June .Smith opened his mouth stupidly .The rest of the room was very quiet .But if you think its beneath you you can leave Harry said .Smith did not move .Nor did anybody else .Okay said Harry his mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eyes upon him I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice .It felt very odd to be issuing instructions but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed .Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up .Predictably Neville was left partnerless .You can practice with me Harry told him .Right on the count of three then one two three The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmusl Wands flew in all directions missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air .Harry was too quick for Neville whose wand went spinning out of his hand hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm .Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all but merely causing them to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them .Expelliarmusl said Neville and Harry caught unawares felt his wand fly out of his hand .I DID IT !said Neville gleefully .Ive never done it before I DID IT !Good one !said Harry encouragingly deciding not to point out that in a real duel situation Nevilles opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side .Listen Neville can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing ?Harry moved off into the middle of the room .Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein his own wand would fly out of his hand yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound .Harry did not have to look far for the solution of the mystery however Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back .Sorry Harry said George hastily when Harry caught his eye .Couldnt resist .Harry walked around the other pairs trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong .Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner she was doing very well whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her .Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily giving his partner time to get in under his guard the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them .Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy occasionally sending Justin FinchFletchleys wand spinning out of his hand at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end .Okay stop !Harry shouted .Stop STOP .I need a whistle he thought and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books .He caught it up and blew hard .Everyone lowered their wands .That wasnt bad said Harry but theres definite room for improvement .Zacharias Smith glared at him .Lets try again .He moved off around the room again stopping here and there to make suggestions .Slowly the general performance improved .He avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer .Oh no said Cho rather wildly as he approached .Expelliarmiousl I mean Exnellimellius I oh sorry Marietta !Her curlyhaired friends sleeve had caught fire Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault .You made me nervous I was doing all right before then !Cho told Harry ruefully .That was quite good Harry lied but when she raised her eyebrows he said Well no it was lousy but I know you can do it properly I was watching from over there .She laughed .Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away .Dont mind her Cho muttered .She doesnt really want to be here but I made her come with me .Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge you see her mum works for the Ministry .What about your parents ?asked Harry .Well theyve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too said Cho drawing herself up proudly .But if they think Im not going to fight YouKnow Who after what happened to Cedric She broke off looking rather confused and an awkward silence fell between them Terry Boots wand went whizzing past Harrys ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose .Well my father is very supportive of any anti Ministry action !said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin FinchFletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head .Hes always saying hed believe anything of Fudge I mean the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated !And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him .And then theres his Umgubular Slashkilter Dont ask Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth looking puzzled .She giggled .Hey Harry Hermione called from the other end of the room have you checked the time ?He looked down at his watch and received a shock it was already ten past nine which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being outofbounds .He blew his whistle everybody stopped shouting Expelliarmusl and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor .Well that was pretty good said Harry but weve overrun wed better leave it here .Same time same place next week ?Sooner !said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement .Angelina however said quickly The Quidditch seasons about to start we need team practices too !Lets say next Wednesday night then said Harry and we can decide on additional meetings then .Come on wed better get going .He pulled out the Marauders Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor .He let them all leave in threes and fours watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the Fat Ladys portrait .That was really really good Harry said Hermione when finally it was just her Harry and Ron left .Yeah it was !said Ron enthusiastically as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them .Did you see me disarm Hermione Harry ?Only once said Hermione stung .I got you loads more than you got me I did not only get you once I got you at least three times Well if youre counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand They argued all the way back to the common room but Harry was not listening to them .He had one eye on the Marauders Map but he was also thinking of how Cho had said he made her nervous .THE LION AND THE SERPENT Harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks a glowing secret that supported him through Umbridges classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes .He and the D .A .were resisting her under her very nose doing the very thing that she and the Ministry most feared and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhards book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed Hermione how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings hard effort how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust .He was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for D .A .meetings as they had to accommodate three separate Quidditch teams practices which were often rearranged depending on the weather conditions but Harry was not sorry about this he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable .If anyone was watching them it would be hard to make out a pattern .Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often .She gave each of the members of the D .A .a fake Galleon Ron became very excited when he saw the basket at first convinced that she was actually giving out gold .You see the numerals around the edge of the coins ?Hermione said holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting .The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches .On real Galleons thats just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin .On these fake coins though the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting .The coins will grow hot when the date changes so if youre carrying them in a pocket youll be able to feel them .We take one each and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting hell change the numbers on his coin and because Ive put a Protean Charm on them theyll all change to mimic his .A blank silence greeted Hermione s words .She looked around at all the faces upturned to her rather disconcerted .Well I thought it was a good idea she said uncertainly I mean even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets theres nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon is there ?But .well if you dont want to use them .You can do a Protean Charm ?said Terry Boot .Yes said Hermione .But thats .thats N .E .W .T .standard that is he said weakly .Oh said Hermione trying to look modest .Oh .well .yes I suppose it is .How come youre not in Ravenclaw ?he demanded staring at Hermione with something close to wonder .With brains like yours ?Well the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting said Hermione brightly but it decided on Gryffindor in the end .So does that mean were using the Galleons ?There was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to collect one from the basket .Harry looked sideways at Hermione .You know what these remind me of ?No whats that ?The Death Eaters scars .Voldemort touches one of them and all their scars burn and they know theyve got to join him .Well .yes said Hermione quietly .That is where I got the idea .but youll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members skin .Yeah .I prefer your way said Harry grinning as he slipped his Galleon into his pocket .I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them .Fat chance said Ron who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air .I havent got any real Galleons to confuse it with .As the first Quidditch match of the season Gryffindor versus Slytherin drew nearer their D .A .meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices .The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game .The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome for they of course would be playing both teams over the coming year and the Heads of House of the competing teams though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship were determined to see their sides victory .Harry realized how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match .I think youve got enough to be getting on with at the moment she said loftily .Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly Ive become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study boys and I really dont want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape so use the extra time to practice wont you ?Snape was no less obviously partisan He had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play .He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors .When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth Snape insisted that she must have attempted a HairThickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper Miles Bletchley hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library .Harry felt optimistic about Gryffindors chances they had after all never lost to Malfoys team .Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Woods standard but he was working extremely hard to improve .His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more .On the other hand Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form During one memorable practice he had hung one handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end .The rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan the Irish International Keeper against Polands top Chaser Ladislaw Zamojski .Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud and that they were seriously considering admitting that he was related to them something he assured Ron they had been trying to deny for four years .The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got onto the pitch .Harry of course had endured their snide comments for more than four years so whispers of Hey Potty I heard Warringtons sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday far from chilling his blood made him laugh .Warringtons aims so pathetic Id be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me he retorted which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinsons face .But Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults jeers and intimidation .When Slytherins some of them seventh years and considerably larger than he was muttered as they passed in the corridors Got your bed booked in the hospital wing Weasley ?he did not laugh but turned a delicate shade of green .When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle which he did whenever they were within sight of each other Rons ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too .October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived cold as frozen iron with hard frosts every morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces .The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale pearly gray the mountains around Hogwarts became snowcapped and the temperature in the castle dropped so far that many students wore their thick protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons .The morning of the match dawned bright and cold .When Harry awoke he looked around at Rons bed and saw him sitting bolt upright his arms around his knees staring fixedly into space .You all right ?said Harry .Ron nodded but did not speak .Harry was reminded forcibly of the time that Ron had accidentally put a slug vomiting charm on himself .He looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth .You just need some breakfast Harry said bracingly .Cmon .The Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual .As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise Harry looked around and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing in addition to the usual greenandsilver scarves and hats silver badges in the shape of what seemed to be crowns .For some reason many of them waved at Ron laughing uproariously .Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by but he was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them .They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table where everyone was wearing red and gold but far from raising Rons spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale he collapsed onto the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal .I mustve been mental to do this he said in a croaky whisper .Mental .Dont be thick said Harry firmly passing him a choice of cereals .Youre going to be fine .Its normal to be nervous .Im rubbish croaked Ron .Im lousy .I cant play to save my life .What was I thinking ?Get a grip said Harry sternly .Look at that save you made with your foot the other day even Fred and George said it was brilliant Ron turned a tortured face to Harry .That was an accident he whispered miserably .I didnt mean to do it I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident .Well said Harry recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise a few more accidents like that and the games in the bag isnt it ?Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing redandgold scarves gloves and rosettes .Howre you feeling ?Ginny asked Ron who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them .Hes just nervous said Harry .Well thats a good sign I never feel you perform as well in exams if youre not a bit nervous said Hermione heartily .Hello said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them .Harry looked up Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table .Many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and pointing she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a lifesize lions head which was perched precariously on her head .Im supporting Gryffindor said Luna pointing unnecessarily at her hat .Look what it does .She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand .It opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump .Its good isnt it ?said Luna happily .I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin you know but there wasnt time .Anyway .good luck Ronald !She drifted away .They had not quite recovered from the shock of Lunas hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them accompanied by Katie and Alicia whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey .When youre ready she said were going to go straight down to the pitch check out conditions and change .Well be there in a bit Harry assured her .Rons just got to have some breakfast .It became clear after ten minutes however that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms .As they rose from the table Hermione got up too and taking Harrys arm she drew him to one side .Dont let Ron see whats on those Slytherins badges she whispered urgently .Harry looked questioningly at her but she shook her head warningly Ron had just ambled over to them looking lost and desperate .Good luck Ron said Hermione standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek .And you Harry Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall .He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him looking puzzled as though he was not quite sure what had just happened .He seemed too distracted to notice much around him but Harry cast a curious glance at the crownshaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table and this time he made out the words etched onto them WEASLEY IS OUR KING With an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good he hurried Ron across the entrance hall down the stone steps and out into the icy air .The frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns toward the stadium .There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes .Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked but he was not sure that Ron was listening .Angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered .Harry and Ron pulled on their robes Ron attempted to do his up backtofront for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help and then sat down to listen to the prematch talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch .Okay Eve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin said Angelina consulting a piece of parchment .Last years Beaters Derrick and Bole have left now but it looks as though Montagues replaced them with the usual gorillas rather than anyone who can fly particularly well .Theyre two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle I dont know much about them We do said Harry and Ron together .Well they dont look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another said Angelina pocketing her parchment but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way onto the pitch without signposts .Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold Harry assured her .They could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators stands now .Some people were singing though Harry could not make out the words .He was starting to feel nervous but he knew his butterflies were as nothing to Rons who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again his jaw set and his complexion pale gray .Its time said Angelina in a hushed voice looking at her watch .Cmon everyone .good luck .The team rose shouldered their brooms and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight .A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles .The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them .They too were wearing those silver crownshaped badges .The new captain Montague was built along the same lines as Dudley with massive forearms like hairy hams .Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle almost as large blinking stupidly in the sunlight swinging their new Beaters bats .Malfoy stood to one side the sunlight gleaming on his whiteblond head .He caught Harrys eye and smirked tapping the crownshaped badge on his chest .Captains shake hands ordered the umpire Madam Hooch as Angelina and Montague reached each other .Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelinas fingers though she did not wince .Mount your brooms .Madam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew .The balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off toward the goal hoops .He zoomed higher dodging a Bludger and set off on a wide lap of the pitch gazing around for a glint of gold on the other side of the stadium Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same .And its Johnson Johnson with the Quaffle what a player that girl is Ive been saying it for years but she still wont go out with me JORDAN !yelled Professor McGonagall .Just a fun fact Professor adds a bit of interest and shes ducked Warrington shes passed Montague shes ouch been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe .Montague catches the Quaffle Montague heading back up the pitch and nice Bludger there from George Weasley thats a Bludger to the head for Montague he drops the Quaffle caught by Katie Bell Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnets away Lee Jordans commentary rang through the stadium and Harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd all yelling and booing and singing dodges Warrington avoids a Bludger close call Alicia and the crowd are loving this just listen to them whats that theyre singing ?And as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands Weasley cannot save a thing He cannot block a single ring Thats why Slytherins all sing Weasley is our King .Weasley was born in a bin He always lets the Quaffle in Weasley will make sure we win Weasley is our King .and Alicia passes back to Angelina !Lee shouted and as Harry swerved his insides boiling at what he had just heard he knew Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing .Come on now Angelina looks like shes got just the Keeper to beat !SHE SHOOTS SHE aah .Bletchley the Slytherin Keeper had saved the goal he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron Weasley is our King Weasley is our King He always lets the Quaffle in Weasley is our King .Harry could not help himself Abandoning his search for the Snitch he turned his Firebolt toward Ron a lone figure at the far end of the pitch hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted toward him .and its Warrington with the Quaffle Warrington heading for goal hes out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below Weasley cannot save a thing He cannot block a single ring .so its the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper Weasley brother of Beaters Fred and George and a promising new talent on the team come on Ron !But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end Ron had dived wildly his arms wide and the Quaffle had soared between them straight through Rons central hoop .Slytherin score !came Lees voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below .So thats tennil to Slytherin bad luck Ron .The Slytherins sang even louder WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN .and Gryffindor back in possession and its Katie Bell tanking up the pitch cried Lee valiantly though the singing was now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it .WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN WEASLEY IS OUR KING .Harry WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?screamed Angelina soaring past him to keep up with Katie .GET GOING !Harry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than a minute watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch horrified he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again staring around trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium WEASLEY IS OUR KING WEASLEY IS OUR KING .There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked Malfoy was still circling the stadium just like Harry .They passed midway around the pitch going in opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy singing loudly WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN .and its Warrington again bellowed Lee who passes to Pucey Puceys off past Spinnet come on now Angelina you can take him turns out you cant but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley I mean George Weasley oh who cares one of them anyway and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell er drops it too so thats Montague with the Quaffle Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle and hes off up the pitch come on now Gryffindor block him !Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal hoops willing himself not to look at what was going on at Rons end as he sped past the Slytherin Keeper he heard Bletchley singing along with the crowd below WEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING .and Puceys dodged Alicia again and hes heading straight for goal stop it Ron !Harry did not have to look to see what had happened There was a terrible groan from the Gryffindor end coupled with fresh screams and applause from the Slytherins .Looking down Harry saw the pugfaced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands her back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring THATS WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING WEASLEY IS OUR KING .But twentynil was nothing there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual Harry assured himself bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montagues watch strap .But Ron let in two more goals .There was an edge of panic in Harrys desire to find the Snitch now .If he could just get it soon and finish the game quickly .and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey ducks Montague nice swerve Katie and she throws to Johnson Angelina Johnson takes the Quaffle shes past Warrington shes heading for goal come on now Angelina GRYFFINDOR SCORE !Its fortyten forty ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle .Harry could hear Lunas ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened only thirty points in it that was nothing they could pull back easily .Harry ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch keeping one eye on Malfoy in case he showed signs of having spotted it but Malfoy like him was continuing to soar around the stadium searching fruitlessly .Pucey throws to Warrington Warrington to Montague Montague back to Pucey Johnson intervenes Johnson takes the Quaffle Johnson to Bell this looks good I mean bad Bells hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and its Pucey in possession again .WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN HE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN WEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN But Harry had seen it at last The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch .He dived .In a matter of seconds Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harrys left a greenandsilver blur lying flat on his broom .The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off toward the other side of the stands its change of direction suited Malfoy who was nearer .Harry pulled his Firebolt around he and Malfoy were now neck and neck .Feet from the ground Harry lifted his right hand from his broom stretching toward the Snitch .to his right Malfoys arm extended too reaching groping .It was over in two breathless desperate windswept seconds Harrys fingers closed around the tiny struggling ball Malfoys fingernails scrabbled the back of Harrys hand hopelessly Harry pulled his broom upward holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval .They were saved it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won WHAM A Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forward off his broom luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground having dived so low to catch the Snitch but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch .He heard Madam Hoochs shrill whistle an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls angry yells and jeering a thud then Angelinas frantic voice .Are you all right ?Course I am said Harry grimly taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet .Madam Hooch was zooming toward one of the Slytherin players above him though he could not see who it was at this angle .It was that thug Crabbe said Angelina angrily .He whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw youd got the Snitch but we won Harry we won !Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand Draco Malfoy had landed close by whitefaced with fury he was still managing to sneer .Saved Weasleys neck havent you ?he said to Harry .Ive never seen a worse Keeper .but then he was born in a bin .Did you like my lyrics Potter ?Harry did not answer he turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one yelling and punching the air in triumph all except Ron who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone .We wanted to write another couple of verses !Malfoy called as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry .But we couldnt find rhymes for fat and ugly we wanted to sing about his mother see Talk about sour grapes said Angelina casting Malfoy a disgusted look .we couldnt fit in useless loser either for his father you know Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about .Halfway through shaking Harrys hand they stiffened looking around at Malfoy .Leave it said Angelina at once taking Fred by the arm .Leave it Fred let him yell hes just sore he lost the jumpedup little but you like the Weasleys dont you Potter ?said Malfoy sneering .Spend holidays there and everything dont you ?Cant see how you stand the stink but I suppose when youve been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys hovel smells okay Harry grabbed hold of George meanwhile it was taking the combined efforts of Angelina Alicia and Katie to stop Fred leaping on Malfoy who was laughing openly .Harry looked around for Madam Hooch but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack .Or perhaps said Malfoy leering as he backed away you can remember what your mothers house stank like Potter and Weasleys pigsty reminds you of it Harry was not aware of releasing George all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting at Malfoy .He had completely forgotten the fact that all the teachers were watching All he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible .With no time to draw out his wand he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoys stomach Harry !HARRY !GEORGE !1VO !He could hear girls voices screaming Malfoy yelling George swearing a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him but he did not care not until somebody in the vicinity yelled IMPEDIMENTA !and only when he was knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach .What do you think youre doing ?screamed Madam Hooch as Harry leapt to his feet again it was she who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx .She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other her broom lay abandoned several feet away .Malfoy was curled up on the ground whimpering and moaning his nose bloody George was sporting a swollen lip Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers and Crabbe was cackling in the background .Ive never seen behavior like it back up to the castle both of you and straight to your Head of Houses office !Go !Now Harry and George marched off the pitch both panting neither saying a word to each other .The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps .Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoys jaw looking down he saw the Snitchs silver wings protruding from between his fingers struggling for release .They had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagalls office when she came marching along the corridor behind them .She was wearing a Gryffindor scarf but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode toward them looking livid .In !she said furiously pointing to the door .Harry and George entered .She strode around behind her desk and faced them quivering with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor .Well ?she said .I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition .Two onto one !Explain yourselves !Malfoy provoked us said Harry stiffly .Provoked you ?shouted Professor McGonagall slamming a fist onto her desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off it and burst open littering the floor with Ginger Newts .Hed just lost hadnt he of course he wanted to provoke you !But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two He insulted my parents snarled George .And Harrys mother .But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling did you ?bellowed Professor McGonagall .Have you any idea what youve ?Hem hem .George and Harry both spun around .Dolores Umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad and smiling in the horribly sickly ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent misery .May I help Professor McGonagall ?asked Professor Umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice .Blood rushed into Professor McGonagalls face .Help ?she repeated in a constricted voice .What do you mean ‘help ?Professor Umbridge moved forward into the office still smiling her sickly smile .Why I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority .Harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor McGonagalls nostrils .You thought wrong she said turning her back on Umbridge .Now you two had better listen closely .I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you I do not care if he insulted every family member you possess your behavior was disgusting and I am giving each of you a weeks worth of detention !Do not look at me like that Potter you deserve it !And if either of you ever Hem hem .Professor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for patience as she turned her face toward Professor Umbridge again .Yes ?I think they deserve rather more than detentions said Umbridge smiling still more broadly .Professor McGonagalls eyes flew open .But unfortunately she said with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw it is what I think that counts as they are in my House Dolores .Well actually Minerva simpered Umbridge I think youll find that what I think does count .Now where is it ?Cornelius just sent it .I mean she gave a little false laugh as she rummaged in her handbag the Minister just sent it .Ah yes .She had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said .Hem hem . ‘Educational Decree Number Twenty five .Not another one !exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently .Well yes said Umbridge still smiling .As a matter of fact Minerva it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment .You remember how you overrode me when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to reform ?How you took the case to Dumbledore who insisted that the team be allowed to play ?Well now I couldnt have that .I contacted the Minister at once and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges or she that is to say I would have less authority than common teachers !And you see now dont you Minerva how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team reforming ?Dreadful tempers .Anyway I was reading out our amendment .hem hem .The High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts and the power to alter such punishments sanctions and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members .Signed Cornelius Fudge Minister of Magic Order of Merlin First Class etc .etc .She rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag still smiling .So .I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again she said looking from Harry to George and back again .Harry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand .Ban us ?he said and his voice sounded strangely distant .From playing .ever again ?Yes Mr Potter I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick said Umbridge her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said .You and Mr Weasley here .And I think to be safe this young mans twin ought to be stopped too if his teammates had not restrained him I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr Malfoy as well .I will want their broomsticks confiscated of course I shall keep them safely in my office to make sure there is no infringement of my ban .But I am not unreasonable Professor McGonagall she continued turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice staring at her .The rest of the team can continue playing I saw no signs of violence from any of them .Well .good afternoon to you .And with a look of the utmost satisfaction Umbridge left the room leaving a horrified silence in her wake .Banned said Angelina in a hollow voice late that evening in the common room .Banned .No Seeker and no Beaters .What on earth are we going to do ?It did not feel as though they had won the match at all .Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces the team themselves were slumped around the fire all apart from Ron who had not been seen since the end of the match .Its just so unfair said Alicia numbly .I mean what about Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown ?Has she banned him ?No said Ginny miserably she and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry .He just got lines I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner .And banning Fred when he didnt even do anything !said Alicia furiously pummeling her knee with her fist .Its not my fault I didnt said Fred with a very ugly look on his face .I wouldve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadnt been holding me back .Harry stared miserably at the dark window .Snow was falling .The Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room people were watching its progress as though hypnotized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair trying to catch it .Im going to bed said Angelina getting slowly to her feet .Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream .Maybe Ill wake up tomorrow and find we havent played yet .She was soon followed by Alicia and Katie .Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later glowering at everyone they passed and Ginny went not long after that .Only Harry and Hermione were left beside the fire .Have you seen Ron ?Hermione asked in a low voice .Harry shook his head .I think hes avoiding us said Hermione .Where do you think he ?But at that precise moment there was a creaking sound behind them as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole .He was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair .When he saw Harry and Hermione he stopped dead in his tracks .Where have you been ?said Hermione anxiously springing up .Walking Ron mumbled .He was still wearing his Quidditch things .You look frozen said Hermione .Come and sit down !Ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from Harrys not looking at him .The stolen Snitch zoomed over their heads .Im sorry Ron mumbled looking at his feet .What for ?said Harry .For thinking I can play Quidditch said Ron .Im going to resign first thing tomorrow .If you resign said Harry testily therell only be three players left on the team .And when Ron looked puzzled he said Ive been given a lifetime ban .Sove Fred and George .What ?Ron yelped .Hermione told him the full story Harry could not bear to tell it again .When she had finished Ron looked more anguished than ever .This is all my fault You didnt make me punch Malfoy said Harry angrily .if I wasnt so lousy at Quidditch its got nothing to do with that it was that song that wound me up it wouldve wound anyone up Hermione got up and walked to the window away from the argument watching the snow swirling down against the pane .Look drop it will you !Harry burst out .Its bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything !Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes .After a while he said in a dull voice This is the worst Ive ever felt in my life .Join the club said Harry bitterly .Well said Hermione her voice trembling slightly .I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up .Oh yeah ?said Harry skeptically .Yeah said Hermione turning away from the pitch black snowflecked window a broad smile spreading across her face .Hagrids back .HAGRIDS TALE Harry sprinted up to the boys dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauders Map from his trunk he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls dormitories wearing scarf gloves and one of her own knobbly elf hats .Well its cold out there !she said defensively as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently .They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing then moving slowly and cautiously they proceeded down the many staircases pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs Norris .They were lucky they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like Weasley Is Our King .They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent snowy grounds .With a great leap of his heart Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrids chimney .He set off at a quick march the other two jostling and bumping along behind him and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times a dog started barking frantically inside .Hagrid its us !Harry called through the keyhole .Shoulda known !said a gruff voice .They beamed at one another under the cloak they could tell that Hagrids voice was pleased .Bin home three seconds .Out the way Fang .Out the way yeh dozy dog .The bolt was drawn back the door creaked open and Hagrids head appeared in the gap .Hermione screamed .Merlins beard keep it down !said Hagrid hastily staring wildly over their heads .Under that cloak are yeh ?Well get in get in !Im sorry !Hermione gasped as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them .I just oh Hagrid .Its nuthin its nuthin !said Hagrid hastily shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror .Hagrids hair was matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purpleandblack bruises .There were many cuts on his face and hands some of them still bleeding and he was moving gingerly which made Harry suspect broken ribs .It was obvious that he had only just got home a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door .Hagrid himself twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it .What happened to you ?Harry demanded while Fang danced around them all trying to lick their faces .Told yeh nuthin said Hagrid firmly .Want a cuppa ?Come off it said Ron youre in a right state !Im tellinyeh Im fine said Hagrid straightening up and turning to beam at them all but wincing .Blimey its good ter see you three again had good summers did yeh ?Hagrid youve been attacked !said Ron .Fer the las time its nuthin !said Hagrid firmly .Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ?Ron demanded .You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey Hagrid said Hermione anxiously .Some of those cuts look nasty .Im dealin with it all righ ?said Hagrid repressively .He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it .Underneath was a raw bloody greentinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire .Youre not going to eat that are you Hagrid ?said Ron leaning in for a closer look .It looks poisonous .Its s posed ter look like that its dragon meat Hagrid said .An I didn get it ter eat .He picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face .Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction .Thas better .It helps with the stingin yeh know .So are you going to tell us whats happened to you ?Harry asked .Can Harry .Top secret .Moren me jobs worth ter tell yeh that .Did the giants beat you up Hagrid ?asked Hermione quietly .Hagrids fingers slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily onto his chest .Giants ?said Hagrid catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face .Who said anythin abou giants ?Who yeh bin talkin to ?Whos told yeh what Ive whos said Ive bin eh ?We guessed said Hermione apologetically .Oh yeh did did yeh ?said Hagrid fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak .It was kind of .obvious said Ron .Harry nodded .Hagrid glared at them then snorted threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle which was now whistling .Never known kids like you three fer knowin moren yeh oughta he muttered splashing boiling water into three of his bucketshaped mugs .An Im not complimentin yeh neither .Nosy somed call it .Interferin .But his beard twitched .So you have been to look for giants ?said Harry grinning as he sat down at the table .Hagrid set tea in front of each of them sat down picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face .Yeah all righ he grunted I have .And you found them ?said Hermione in a hushed voice .Well theyre not that difficult ter find ter be honest said Hagrid .Pretty big see .Where are they ?said Ron .Mountains said Hagrid unhelpfully .So why dont Muggles ?They do said Hagrid darkly .Ony their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin accidents aren they ?He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising .Come on Hagrid tell us what youve been up to !said Ron .Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors Hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time a large quantity of spit tea and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid with a soft splat onto the floor .Whadda yeh mean attacked by dementors ?growled Hagrid .Didnt you know ?Hermione asked him wideeyed .I don know anything thats been happenin since I left .I was on a secret mission wasn I didn wan owls followin me all over the place ruddy dementors !Yehre not serious ?Yeah I am they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me WHAT ?and I had to go to a hearing and everything but tell us about the giants first .You were expelled ?Tell us about your summer and Ill tell you about mine .Hagrid glared at him through his one open eye .Harry looked right back an expression of innocent determination on his face .Oh all righ Hagrid said in a resigned voice .He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fangs mouth .Oh Hagrid dont its not hygien Hermione began but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye .He took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said Well we set off righ after term ended Madame Maxime went with you then ?Hermione interjected .Yeah thas right said Hagrid and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak .Yeah it was jus the pair of us .An Ill tell yeh this shes not afraid of roughin it Olympe .Yeh know shes a fine welldressed woman an knowin where we was goin I wondered ow shed feel abou clamberin over boulders an sleepin in caves an tha bu she never complained once .You knew where you were going ?Harry asked .You knew where the giants were ?Well Dumbledore knew an he told us said Hagrid .Are they hidden ?asked Ron .Is it a secret where they are ?Not really said Hagrid shaking his shaggy head .Its jus that mos wizards aren bothered where they are s long as its a good long way away .But where they ares very difficult ter get ter fer humans anyway so we needed Dumbledores instructions .Took us abou a month ter get there A month ?said Ron as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time .But why couldnt you just grab a Portkey or something ?There was an odd expression in Hagrids unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron it was almost pitying .Were bein watched Ron he said gruffly .What dyou mean ?Yeh don understand said Hagrid .The Ministrys keepin an eye on Dumbledore an anyone they reckons in league with him an We know about that said Harry quickly keen to hear the rest of Hagrids story .We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore So you couldnt use magic to get there ?asked Ron looking thunderstruck .You had to act like Muggles all the way ?Well not exactly all the way said Hagrid cagily .We jus had ter be careful cause Olympe an me we stick out a bit Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea .so were not hard ter follow .We was pretendin we was goin on holiday together so we got inter France an we made like we was headin fer where Olympes school is cause we knew we was bein tailed by someone from the Ministry .We had to go slow cause Im not really s posed ter use magic an we knew the Ministryd be lookin fer a reason ter run us in .But we managed ter give the berk tailin us the slip round abou DeeJohn Ooooh Dijon ?said Hermione excitedly .Ive been there on holiday did you see ?She fell silent at the look on Rons face .We chanced a bit o magic after that and it wasn a bad journey .Ran inter a couple o mad trolls on the Polish border an I had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk but apart from tha couldnta bin smoother .An then we reached the place an we started trekkin up through the mountains lookin fer signs of em .We had ter lay off the magic once we got near em .Partly cause they don like wizards an we didn want ter put their backs up too soon and partly cause Dumbledore had warned us YouKnowWho was bound ter be after the giants an all .Said it was odds on hed sent a messenger off ter them already .Told us ter be very careful of drawin attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around .Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea .Go on !said Harry urgently .Found em said Hagrid baldly .Went over a ridge one nigh an there they was spread ou underneath us .Little fires burnin below an huge shadows .It was like watchin bits o the mountain movin .How big are they ?asked Ron in a hushed voice .T3out twenty feet said Hagrid casually .Some o the bigger ones mighta bin twentyfive .And how many were there ?asked Harry .I reckon abou seventy or eighty said Hagrid .Is that all ?said Hermione .Yep said Hagrid sadly eighty left an there was loads once musta bin a hundred diffrent tribes from all over the world .But theyve bin dyin out fer ages .Wizards killed a few o course but mostly they killed each other an now theyre dyin out faster than ever .Theyre not made ter live bunched up together like tha .Dumbledore says its our fault it was the wizards who forced em to go an made em live a good long way from us an they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection .So said Harry you saw them and then what ?Well we waited till morning didn want ter go sneakin up on em in the dark fer our own safety said Hagrid .Bout three in the mornin they fell asleep jus where they was sittin .We didn dare sleep .Fer one thing we wanted ter make sure none of em woke up an came up where we were an fer another the snorin was unbelievable .Caused an avalanche near mornin .Anyway once it was light we wen down ter see em .Just like that ?said Ron looking awestruck .You just walked right into a giant camp ?Well Dumbledored told us how ter do it said Hagrid .Give the Gurg gifts show some respect yeh know .Give the what gifts ?asked Harry .Oh the Gurg means the chief .How could you tell which one was the Gurg ?asked Ron .Hagrid grunted in amusement .No problem he said .He was the biggest the ugliest an the laziest .Sittin there waitin ter be brought food by the others .Dead goats an such like .Name o Karkus .Id put him at twentytwo twenty three feet an the weight of a couple o bull elephants .Skin like rhino hide an all .And you just walked up to him ?said Hermione breathlessly .Well .down ter him where he was lyin in the valley .They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains see beside a mountain lake an Karkus was lyin by the lake roarin at the others ter feed him an his wife .Olympe an I went down the mountainside But didnt they try and kill you when they saw you ?asked Ron incredulously .It was defnitely on some of their minds said Hagrid shrugging but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do which was ter hold our gift up high an keep our eyes on the Gurg an ignore the others .So thas what we did .An the rest of em went quiet an watched us pass an we got right up ter Karkuss feet an we bowed an put our present down in front o him .What do you give a giant ?asked Ron eagerly .Food ?Nah he can get food all righ fer himself said Hagrid .We took him magic .Giants like magic jus dont like us usin it against em .Anyway that firs day we gave him a branch o Gubraithian fire .Hermione said wow softly but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement .A branch of ?Everlasting fire said Hermione irritably you ought to know that by now Professor Flitwicks mentioned it at least twice in class !Well anyway said Hagrid quickly intervening before Ron could answer back Dumbledored bewitched this branch to burn evermore which isn somethin any wizard could do an so I lies it down in the snow by Karkuss feet and says ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore who sends his respectful greetings .And what did Karkus say ?asked Harry eagerly .Nothin said Hagrid .Didn speak English .Youre kidding !Didn matter said Hagrid imperturbably Dumbledore had warned us tha migh happen .Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o giants who knew our lingo an they translated fer us .And did he like the present ?asked Ron .Oh yeah it went down a storm once they understood what it was said Hagrid turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye .Very pleased .So then I said Altars Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift .Why couldnt you speak to them that day ?asked Hermione .Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow said Hagrid .Let em see we kept our promises .Well come back tomorrow with another present an then we do come back with another present gives a good impression see ?An gives them time ter test out the firs present an find out its a good one an get em eager fer more .In any case giants like Karkus overload em with information an theyll kill yeh jus to simplify things .So we bowed outta the way an went off an found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an the followin mornin we went back an this time we found Karkus sittin up waitin fer us lookin all eager .And you talked to him ?Oh yeah .Firs we presented him with a nice battle helmet goblinmade an indestructible yeh know an then we sat down an we talked .What did he say ?Not much said Hagrid .Listened mostly .But there were good signs .Hed heard o Dumbledore heard hed argued against the killin of the last giants in Britain .Karkus seemed ter be quite intrested in what Dumbledore had ter say .An a few o the others specially the ones who had some English they gathered round an listened too .We were hopeful when we left that day .Promised ter come back next day with another present .But that night it all wen wrong .What dyou mean ?said Ron quickly .Well like I say theyre not meant ter live together giants said Hagrid sadly .Not in big groups like that .They can help themselves they half kill each other every few weeks .The men fight each other an the women fight each other the remnants of the old tribes fight each other an thats even without squabbles over food an the best fires an sleepin spots .Yehd think seein as how their whole race is abou finished theyd lay off each other but .Hagrid sighed deeply That night a fight broke out we saw it from the mouth of our cave lookin down on the valley .Went on fer hours yeh wouldn believe the noise .An when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an his head was lyin at the bottom o the lake .Whose head ?gasped Hermione .Karkuss said Hagrid heavily .There was a new Gurg Golgomath .He sighed deeply .Well we hadn bargained on a new Gurg two days after wed made friendly contact with the firs one an we had a funny feelin Golgomath wouldn be so keen ter listen to us but we had ter try .You went to speak to him ?asked Ron incredulously .After youd watched him rip off another giants head ?Course we did said Hagrid we hadn gone all that way ter give up after two days !We wen down with the next present wed meant ter give ter Karkus .I knew it was no go before Id opened me mouth .He was sitting there wearin Karkus s helmet leerin at us as we got nearer .Hes massive one o the biggest ones there .Black hair an matchin teeth an a necklace o bones .Humanlookin bones some of em .Well I gave it a go held out a great roll o dragon skin an said A gift fer the Gurg of the giants Nex thing I knew I was hangin upside down in the air by me feet two of his mates had grabbed me .Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth .How did you get out of that ?asked Harry .Wouldnta done if Olympe hadn bin there said Hagrid .She pulled out her wand an did some o the fastes spellwork Ive ever seen .Ruddy marvelous .Hit the two holdin me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an they dropped me straightaway bu we were in trouble then cause wed used magic against em an thats what giants hate abou wizards .We had ter leg it an we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again .Blimey Hagrid said Ron quietly .So how come its taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days ?asked Hermione .We didn leave after three days !said Hagrid looking outraged .Dumbledore was relyin on us !But youve just said there was no way you could go back !Not by daylight we couldn no .We just had ter rethink a bit .Spent a couple o days lyin low up in the cave an watchin .An wha we saw wasn good .Did he rip off more heads ?asked Hermione sounding squeamish .No said Hagrid .I wish he had .What dyou mean ?I mean we soon found out he didn object ter all wizards just us .Death Eaters ?said Harry quickly .Yep said Hagrid darkly .Couple of em were visitin him evry day bringin gifts ter the Gurg an he wasn dangling them upside down .How dyou know they were Death Eaters ?said Ron .Because I recognized one of em Hagrid growled .Macnair remember him ?Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak ?Maniac he is .Likes killin as much as Golgomath no wonder they were gettin on so well .So Macnairs persuaded the giants to join YouKnow Who ?said Hermione desperately .Hold yer hippogriffs I haven finished me story yet !said Hagrid indignantly who considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place now seemed to be rather enjoying himself .Me an Olympe talked it over an we agreed jus cause the Gurg looked like favorin YouKnowWho didn mean all of em would .We had ter try an persuade some o the others the ones who hadn wanted Golgomath as Gurg .How could you tell which ones they were ?asked Ron .Well they were the ones bein beaten to a pulp weren they ?said Hagrid patiently .The ones with any sense were keepin outta Golgomath s way hidin out in caves roun the gully jus like we were .So we decided wed go pokin round the caves by night an see if we couldn persuade a few o them .You went poking around dark caves looking for giants ?said Ron with awed respect in his voice .Well it wasn the giants who worried us most said Hagrid .We were more concerned abou the Death Eaters .Dumbledore had told us before we wen not ter tangle with em if we could avoid it an the trouble was they knew we was around spect Golgomath told him abou us .At night when the giants were sleepin an we wanted ter be creepin inter the caves Macnair an the other one were sneakin round the mountains lookin fer us .I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin out at them said Hagrid the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard .She was rarin ter attack em .shes somethin when shes roused Olympe .Fiery yeh know .spect its the French in her .Hagrid gazed mistyeyed into the fire .Harry allowed him thirty seconds reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly .So what happened ?Did you ever get near any of the other giants ?What ?Oh .oh yeah we did .Yeah on the third night after Karkus was killed we crept outta the cave wed bin hidin in and headed back down inter the gully keepin our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters .Got inside a few o the caves no go then in abou the sixth one we found three giants hidin .Cave mustve been cramped said Ron .Wasn room ter swing a kneazle said Hagrid .Didnt they attack you when they saw you ?asked Hermione .Probably woulda done if theyd bin in any condition said Hagrid but they was badly hurt all three o them .Golgomaths lot had beaten em unconscious theyd woken up an crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find .Anyway one o them had a bit of English an e translated fer the others an what we had ter say didn seem ter go down too badly .So we kep goin back visitin the wounded .I reckon we had abou six or seven o them convinced at one poin .Six or seven ?said Ron eagerly .Well thats not bad are they going to come over here and start fighting YouKnowWho with us ?But Hermione said What do you mean ‘at one point Hagrid ?Hagrid looked at her sadly .Golgomaths lot raided the caves .The ones tha survived didn wan no more ter to do with us after that .So .so there arent any giants coming ?said Ron looking disappointed .Nope said Hagrid heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face but we did wha we meant ter do we gave em Dumbledores message an some o them heard it an I spect some o themll remember it .Jus maybe them that don want ter stay around Golgomathll move outta the mountains an theres gotta be a chance theyll remember Dumbledores friendly to em .Could be theyll come .Snow was filling up the window now .Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through Fang was drooling with his head in Harrys lap .Hagrid ?said Hermione quietly after a while .Mmm ?Did you .was there any sign of .did you hear anything about your .your .mother while you were there ?Hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and Hermione looked rather scared .Im sorry .I .forget it Dead Hagrid grunted .Died years ago .They told me .Oh .Im .Im really sorry said Hermione in a very small voice .Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders .No need he said shortly .Can remember her much .Wasn a great mother .They were silent again .Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron plainly wanting them to speak .But you still havent explained how you got in this state Hagrid Ron said gesturing toward Hagrids bloodstained face .Or why youre back so late said Harry .Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago Who attacked you ?said Ron .I haven bin attacked !said Hagrid emphatically .I But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door .Hermione gasped her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor Fang yelped .All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway .The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain .Its her Ron whispered .Get under here !Harry said quickly seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak as well .Huddled together they backed away into a corner .Fang was barking madly at the door .Hagrid looked thoroughly confused .Hagrid hide our mugs !Hagrid seized Harrys and Rons mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fangs basket .Fang was now leaping up at the door Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open .Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps .Lips pursed she leaned back so as to see Hagrids face she barely reached his navel .So she said slowly and loudly as though speaking to somebody deaf .Youre Hagrid are you ?Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room her bulging eyes rolling in every direction .Get away she snapped waving her handbag at Fang who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face .Er I don want ter be rude said Hagrid staring at her but who the ruddy hell are you ?My name is Dolores Umbridge .Her eyes were sweeping the cabin .Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood sandwiched between Ron and Hermione .Dolores Umbridge ?Hagrid said sounding thoroughly confused .I thought you were one o them Ministry don you work with Fudge ?I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister yes said Umbridge now pacing around the cabin taking in every tiny detail within from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak .I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Thas brave of yeh said Hagrid theres not manyd take tha job anymore and Hogwarts High Inquisitor said Umbridge giving no sign that she had heard him .Whas that ?said Hagrid frowning .Precisely what I was going to ask said Umbridge pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermiones mug .Oh said Hagrid with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry Ron and Hermione stood hidden oh tha was .was Fang .He broke a mug .So I had ter use this one instead .Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye .Umbridge stood facing him now taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabins .I heard voices she said quietly .I was talkin ter Fang said Hagrid stoutly .And was he talking back to you ?Well .in a manner o speakin said Hagrid looking uncomfortable .I sometimes say Fangs near enough human There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin said Umbridge sleekly .Hermione gasped Harry clapped a hand over her mouth .Luckily Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridges robes and she did not appear to have heard .Well I ony jus got back said Hagrid waving an enormous hand at the haversack .Maybe someone came ter call earlier an I missed em .There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door .Well I .I don know why thatd be .said Hagrid tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry Ron and Hermione stood as though asking for help .Erm .Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin looking around carefully .She bent and peered under the bed .She opened Hagrid s cupboards .She passed within two inches of where Harry Ron and Hermione stood pressed against the wall Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by .After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said What has happened to you ?How did you sustain those injuries ?Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face which in Harrys opinion was a mistake because the blackandpurple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face .Oh I .had a bit of an accident he said lamely .What sort of accident ?II tripped .You tripped she repeated coolly .Yeah thas right .Over .over a friends broomstick .I don fly meself .Well look at the size o me I don reckon theres a broomstick thatd hold me .Friend o mine breeds Abraxan horses I dunno if youve ever seen em big beasts winged yeh know Ive had a bit of a ride on one o them an it was Where have you been ?asked Umbridge cutting coolly through Hagrids babbling .Where ve I . ?Been yes she said .Term started more than two months ago .Another teacher has had to cover your classes .None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts .You left no address .Where have you been ?There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye .Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously .I Ive been away for me health he said .For your health said Umbridge .Her eyes traveled over Hagrids discolored and swollen face dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence .I see .Yeah said Hagrid bit o o fresh air yeh know Yes as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by said Umbridge sweetly .The small patch of Hagrids face that was not black or purple flushed .Well change o scene yeh know Mountain scenery ?said Umbridge swiftly .She knows Harry thought desperately .Mountains ?Hagrid repeated clearly thinking fast .Nope South of France fer me .Bit o sun an .an sea .Really ?said Umbridge .You dont have much of a tan .Yeah .well .sensitive skin said Hagrid attempting an ingratiating smile .Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out .Umbridge looked at him coldly his smile faltered .Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said I shall of course be informing the Minister of your late return .Righ said Hagrid nodding .You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers .So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough .She turned sharply and marched back to the door .Youre inspectin us ?Hagrid echoed blankly looking after her .Oh yes said Umbridge softly looking back at him with her hand on the door handle .The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers Hagrid .Good night .She left closing the door behind her with a snap .Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist .Not yet she breathed in his ear .She might not be gone yet .Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so .Shes goin back ter the castle he said in a low voice .Blimey .inspectin people is she ?Yeah said Harry pulling the cloak off .Trelawneys on probation already .Um .what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class Hagrid ?asked Hermione .Oh don you worry abou that Ive got a great load o lessons planned said Hagrid enthusiastically scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again .Ive bin keepin a couple o creatures saved fer yer O .W .L .year you wait theyre somethin really special .Erm .special in what way ?asked Hermione tentatively .Im not sayin said Hagrid happily .I don want ter spoil the surprise .Look Hagrid said Hermione urgently dropping all pretense Professor Umbridge wont be at all happy if you bring anything to class thats too dangerous Dangerous ?said Hagrid looking genially bemused .Don be silly I wouldn give yeh anythin dangerous !I mean all righ they can look after themselves Hagrid youve got to pass Umbridges inspection and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs stuff like that !said Hermione earnestly .But thas not very interestin Hermione said Hagrid .The stuff Ive gots much more impressive Ive bin bringin em on fer years I reckon Ive got the ony domestic herd in Britain Hagrid .please .said Hermione a note of real desperation in her voice .Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore .Please Hagrid teach us something dull thats bound to come up in our O .W .L .But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a oneeyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner .Lisen its bin a long day an its late he said patting Hermione gently on the shoulder so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud .Oh sorry He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes .Look don you go worryin abou me I promise yeh Ive got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now Im back .Now you lot had better get back up to the castle an don forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh !I dunno if you got through to him said Ron a short while later when having checked that the coast was clear they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went .Then Ill go back again tomorrow said Hermione determinedly .Ill plan his lessons for him if I have to .I dont care if she throws out Trelawney but shes not taking Hagrid !THE EYE OF THE SNAKE Hermione plowed her way back to Hagrids cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning .Harry and Ron wanted to go with her but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again so they grudgingly remained in the common room trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake tobogganing and worst of all bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows .Oy !bellowed Ron finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window OUCH !He withdrew his head sharply his face covered in snow .Its Fred and George he said bitterly slamming the window behind him .Gits .Hermione returned from Hagrids just before lunch shivering slightly her robes damp to the knees .So ?said Ron looking up when she entered .Got all his lessons planned for him ?Well I tried she said dully sinking into a chair beside Harry .She pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip she then pointed this at her robes which began to steam as they dried out .He wasnt even there when I arrived I was knocking for at least half an hour .And then he came stumping out of the forest Harry groaned .The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack .Whats he keeping in there ?Did he say ?asked Harry .No said Hermione miserably .He says he wants them to be a surprise .I tried to explain about Umbridge but he just doesnt get it .He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaeras oh I dont think hes got a chimaera she added at the appalled look on Harry and Rons faces but thats not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs .I dont know how many times I told him hed be better off following GrubblyPlanks plan I honestly dont think he listened to half of what I said .Hes in a bit of a funny mood you know .He still wont say how he got all those injuries .Hagrids reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students .Some like Fred George and Lee roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrids enormous hand others like Parvati and Lavender exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads .Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly Planks lessons and the worst of it was that a very small unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason GrubblyPlanks idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off .It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry Ron and Hermione headed down to Hagrids on Tuesday heavily muffled against the cold .Harry was worried not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them but also about how the rest of the class particularly Malfoy and his cronies would behave if Umbridge was watching them .However the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow toward Hagrid who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest .He did not present a reassuring sight the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding .Harry could not understand this Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing ?As though to complete the ominous picture Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder .Were workin in here today !Hagrid called happily to the approaching students jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him .Bit more sheltered !Anyway they prefer the dark .What prefers the dark ?Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle a trace of panic in his voice .What did he say prefers the dark did you hear ?Harry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered the forest before now he had not been very brave then either .He smiled to himself after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him .Ready ?said Hagrid happily looking around at the class .Right well Ive bin savin a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year .Thought wed go an see these creatures in their natural habitat .Now what were studyin today is pretty rare I reckon Im probably the ony person in Britain whos managed ter train em And youre sure theyre trained are you ?said Malfoy the panic in his voice even more pronounced now .Only it wouldnt be the first time youd brought wild stuff to class would it ?The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too .Course theyre trained said Hagrid scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder .So what happened to your face then ?demanded Malfoy .Mind yer own business !said Hagrid angrily .Now if yehve finished askin stupid questions follow me !He turned and strode straight into the forest .Nobody seemed much disposed to follow .Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione who sighed but nodded and the three of them set off after Hagrid leading the rest of the class .They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow on the ground at all .Hagrid deposited his half a cow with a grunt on the ground stepped back and turned to face his class again most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to tree peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment .Gather roun gather roun said Hagrid encouragingly .Now theyll be attracted by the smell o the meat but Im goin ter give em a call anyway cause theyll like ter know its me .He turned shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird .Nobody laughed most of them looked too scared to make a sound .Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again .A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming .And then as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees .A pair of blank white shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face neck and then skeletal body of a great black winged horse emerged from the darkness .It looked around at the class for a few seconds swishing its long black tail then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs .A great wave of relief broke over Harry .Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures that they were real Hagrid knew about them too .He looked eagerly at Ron but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered Why doesnt Hagrid call again ?Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Rons and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them .There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face and Neville whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail .Oh an here comes another one !said Hagrid proudly as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees folded its leathery wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the meat .Now .put yer hands up who can see em ?Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses Harry raised his hand .Hagrid nodded at him .Yeah .yeah I knew youd be able ter Harry he said seriously .An you too Neville eh ?An Excuse me said Malfoy in a sneering voice but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing ?For answer Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground .The whole class stared at it for a few seconds then several people gasped and Parvati squealed .Harry understood why Bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed .Whats doing it ?Parvati demanded in a terrified voice retreating behind the nearest tree .Whats eating it ?Thestrals said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft oh !of comprehension at Harrys shoulder .Hogwarts has got a whole herd of em in here .Now who knows ?But theyre really really unlucky !interrupted Parvati looking alarmed .Theyre supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them .Professor Trelawney told me once No no no said Hagrid chuckling thas jus superstition that is they aren unlucky theyre dead clever an useful !Course this lot don get a lot o work its mainly jus pullin the school carriages unless Dumbledores takin a long journey an don want ter Apparate an heres another couple look Two more horses came quietly out of the trees one of them passing very close to Parvati who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree saying I think I felt something I think its near me !Don worry it won hurt yeh said Hagrid patiently .Righ now who can tell me why some o you can see them an some cant ?Hermione raised her hand .Go on then said Hagrid beaming at her .The only people who can see thestrals she said are people who have seen death .Thas exactly right said Hagrid solemnly ten points ter Gryffindor .Now thestrals Hem hem .Professor Umbridge had arrived .She was standing a few feet away from Harry wearing her green hat and cloak again her clipboard at the ready .Hagrid who had never heard Umbridge s fake cough before was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral evidently under the impression that it had made the sound .Hem hem .Oh hello !Hagrid said smiling having located the source of the noise .You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning ?said Umbridge in the same loud slow voice she had used with him earlier as though she was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow .Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson ?Oh yeah said Hagrid brightly .Glad yeh found the place all righ !Well as you can see or I dunno can you ?Were doin thestrals today Im sorry ?said Umbridge loudly cupping her hand around her ear and frowning .What did you say ?Hagrid looked a little confused .Er thestralsl he said loudly .Big er winged horses yeh know !He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully .Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard ‘has .to .resort .to .crude .sign .language Well .anyway .said Hagrid turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered .Erm .what was I sayin ? ‘Appears .to .have .poor .short .term .memory muttered Umbridge loudly enough for everyone to hear her .Draco Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early Hermione on the other hand had turned scarlet with suppressed rage .Oh yeah said Hagrid throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridges clipboard but plowing on valiantly .Yeah I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd .Yeah so we started off with a male an five females .This one he patted the first horse to have appeared name o Tenebrus hes my special favorite firs one born here in the forest Are you aware Umbridge said loudly interrupting him that the Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous ?Harrys heart sank like a stone but Hagrid merely chuckled .Thestrals aren dangerous !All righ they might take a bite outta you if yeh really annoy them ‘Shows .signs .of .pleasure .at .idea .of .violence . ‘ muttered Umbridge scribbling on her clipboard again .No come on !said Hagrid looking a little anxious now .I mean a dogll bite if yeh bait it won it but thestrals have jus got a bad reputation because o the death thing people used ter think they were bad omens didn they ?Jus didn understand did they ?Umbridge did not answer she finished writing her last note then looked up at Hagrid and said again very loudly and slowly Please continue teaching as usual .I am going to walk she mimed walking Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter among the students she pointed around at individual members of the class and ask them questions .She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking .Hagrid stared at her clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English .Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now .You hag you evil hag !she whispered as Umbridge walked toward Pansy Parkinson .I know what youre doing you awful twisted vicious Erm .anyway said Hagrid clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson so thestrals .Yeah .Well theres loads o good stuff abou them .Do you find said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks ?Just like Hermione Pansy had tears in her eyes but these were tears of laughter indeed her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles .No .because .well .it sounds .like grunting a lot of the time .Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard .The few unbruised bits of Hagrid s face flushed but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansys answer .Er .yeah .good stuff abou thestrals .Well once theyre tamed like this lot yehll never be lost again . ‘Mazin senses o direction jus tell em where yeh want ter go Assuming they can understand you of course said Malfoy loudly and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles .Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville .You can see the thestrals Longbottom can you ?she said .Neville nodded .Whom did you see die ?she asked her tone indifferent .My .my grandad said Neville .And what do you think of them ?she said waving her stubby hand at the horses who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone .Erm said Neville nervously with a glance at Hagrid .Well theyre .er .okay . ‘Students .are .too .intimidated .to .admit .they .are .frightened .muttered Umbridge making another note on her clipboard .No !said Neville looking upset no Im not scared of them !Its quite all right said Umbridge patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile though it looked more like a leer to Harry .Well Hagrid she turned to look up at him again speaking once more in that loud slow voice I think Ive got enough to be getting along with .You will receive she mimed taking something from the air in front of her the results of your inspection she pointed at the clipboard in ten days time .She held up ten stubby little fingers then her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat she bustled from their midst leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter Hermione actually shaking with fury and Neville looking confused and upset .That foul lying twisting old gargoyle !stormed Hermione half an hour later as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow .You see what shes up to ?Its her thing about halfbreeds all over again shes trying to make out Hagrids some kind of dimwitted troll just because he had a giantess for a mother and oh its not fair that really wasnt a bad lesson at all I mean all right if it had been BlastEnded Skrewts again but thestrals are fine in fact for Hagrid theyre really good !Umbridge said theyre dangerous said Ron .Well its like Hagrid said they can look after themselves said Hermione impatiently and I suppose a teacher like GrubblyPlank wouldnt usually show them to us before N .E .W .T .level but well they are very interesting arent they ?The way some people can see them and some cant !I wish I could .Do you ?Harry asked her quietly .She looked horrorstruck .Oh Harry Im sorry no of course I dont that was a really stupid thing to say Its okay he said quickly dont worry .Im surprised so many people could see them said Ron .Three in a class Yeah Weasley we were just wondering said a malicious voice nearby .Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle were walking along right behind them .Dyou reckon if you saw someone snuff it youd be able to see the Quaffle better ?He Crabbe and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of Weasley Is Our King .Rons ears turned scarlet .Ignore them just ignore them intoned Hermione pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses .December arrived bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth years .Ron and Hermione s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached .They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it said Ron to watch over first and second years spending their break times inside because of the bitter cold And theyre cheeky little snotrags you know we definitely werent that rude when we were in first year said Ron and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels Hes got dung for brains that one said Ron furiously .They were so busy that Hermione had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three .All those poor elves I havent set free yet having to stay over during Christmas because there arent enough hats !Harry who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made bent lower over his History of Magic essay .In any case he did not want to think about Christmas .For the first time in his school career he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts .Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation he felt highly resentful toward the place at the moment .The only thing he really looked forward to were the D .A .meetings and they would have to stop over the holidays as nearly everybody in the D .A .would be spending the time with their families .Hermione was going skiing with her parents something that greatly amused Ron who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains .Ron meanwhile was going home to the Burrow .Harry endured several days of jealousy before Ron said in response to Harry asking how Ron was going to get home for Christmas But youre coming too !Didnt I say ?Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago !Hermione rolled her eyes but Harrys spirits soared The thought of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful only slightly marred by Harrys guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius .He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too but apart from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place he could not help but feel that Mrs Weasley might not want him they were so often at loggerheads .Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mothers old house perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher .Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D .A .meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had because when the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas .He could tell the elf had done it because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling each showing a picture of Harrys face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS !Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered looking dreamy as always .Hello she said vaguely looking around at what remained of the decorations .These are nice did you put them up ?No said Harry it was Dobby the houseelf .Mistletoe said Luna dreamily pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harrys head .He jumped out from under it .Good thinking said Luna very seriously .Its often infested with nargles .Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the arrival of Angelina Katie and Alicia .All three of them were breathless and looked very cold .Well said Angelina dully pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner weve replaced you .Replaced me ?said Harry blankly .You and Fred and George she said impatiently .Weve got another Seeker !Who ?said Harry quickly .Ginny Weasley said Katie .Harry gaped at her .Yeah I know said Angelina pulling out her wand and flexing her arm .But shes pretty good actually .Nothing on you of course she said throwing him a very dirty look but as we cant have you .Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter Did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did ?And what about the Beaters ?he asked trying to keep his voice even .Andrew Kirke said Alicia without enthusiasm and Jack Sloper .Neither of them are brilliant but compared with the rest of the idiots who turned up The arrival of Ron Hermione and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end and within five minutes the room was full enough to prevent him seeing Angelinas burning reproachful looks .Okay he said calling them all to order .I thought this evening we should just go over the things weve done so far because its the last meeting before the holidays and theres no point starting anything new right before a threeweek break Were not doing anything new ?said Zacharias Smith in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room .If Id known that I wouldnt have come .Were all really sorry Harry didnt tell you then said Fred loudly .Several people sniggered .Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach as though he had missed a step going downstairs .We can practice in pairs said Harry .Well start with the Impediment Jinx just for ten minutes then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again .They all divided up obediently Harry partnered Neville as usual .The room was soon full of intermittent cries of Impedimental People froze for a minute or so during which their partners would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx .Neville had improved beyond all recognition .After a while when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others .When he passed Cho she beamed at him he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times .After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again .Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once half the group observed the others for a while then swapped over .Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all .True Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean at whom he had been aiming but it was a much closer miss than usual and everybody else had made enormous progress .At the end of an hour Harry called a halt .Youre getting really good he said beaming around at them .When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff maybe even Patronuses .There was a murmur of excitement .The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas as they went .Feeling cheerful he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away .Ron and Hermione left before he did he hung back a little because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her .No you go on he heard her say to her friend Marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adams apple .He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile .He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak .Instead he heard a hearty sniff .He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room tears pouring down her face .Wha ?He didnt know what to do .She was simply standing there crying silently .Whats up ?he said feebly .She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve .Im sorry she said thickly .I suppose .its just .learning all this stuff .It just makes me .wonder whether .if hed known it all .hed still be alive .Harrys heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel .He ought to have known .She wanted to talk about Cedric .He did know this stuff Harry said heavily .He was really good at it or he could never have got to the middle of that maze .But if Voldemort really wants to kill you you dont stand a chance .She hiccuped at the sound of Voldemorts name but stared at Harry without flinching .You survived when you were just a baby she said quietly .Yeah well said Harry wearily moving toward the door I dunno why nor does anyone else so its nothing to be proud of .Oh dont go !said Cho sounding tearful again .Im really sorry to get all upset like this .I didnt mean to .She hiccuped again .She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy .Harry felt thoroughly miserable .Hed have been so pleased just with a Merry Christmas .I know it must be horrible for you she said mopping her eyes on her sleeve again .Me mentioning Cedric when you saw him die .I suppose you just want to forget about it .Harry did not say anything to this it was quite true but he felt heartless saying it .Youre a rreally good teacher you know said Cho with a watery smile .Ive never been able to Stun anything before .Thanks said Harry awkwardly .They looked at each other for a long moment .Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and at the same time a complete inability to move his feet .Mistletoe said Cho quietly pointing at the ceiling over his head .Yeah said Harry .His mouth was very dry .Its probably full of nargles though .What are nargles ?No idea said Harry .She had moved closer .His brain seemed to have been Stunned .Youd have to ask Loony .Luna I mean .Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh .She was even nearer him now .He could have counted the freckles on her nose .I really like you Harry .He could not think .A tingling sensation was spreading throughout him paralyzing his arms legs and brain .She was much too close .He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes .He returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire nearly everybody else had gone to bed .Hermione was writing a very long letter she had already filled half a roll of parchment which was dangling from the edge of the table .Ron was lying on the hearthrug trying to finish his Transfiguration homework .What kept you ?he asked as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione s .Harry did not answer .He was in a state of shock .Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave .Are you all right Harry ?Hermione asked peering at him over the tip of her quill .Harry gave a halfhearted shrug .In truth he didnt know whether he was all right or not .Whats up ?said Ron hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry .Whats happened ?Harry didnt quite know how to set about telling them and still wasnt sure whether he wanted to .Just as he had decided not to say anything Hermione took matters out of his hands .Is it Cho ?she asked in a businesslike way .Did she corner you after the meeting ?Numbly surprised Harry nodded .Ron sniggered breaking off when Hermione caught his eye .So er what did she want ?he asked in a mock casual voice .She Harry began rather hoarsely he cleared his throat and tried again .She er Did you kiss ?asked Hermione briskly .Ron sat up so fast that he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug .Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry .Well ?he demanded .Harry looked from Rons expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermiones slight frown and nodded .HA !Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timidlooking second years over beside the window jump .A reluctant grin spread over Harrys face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug .Hermione gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter .Well ?Ron said finally looking up at Harry .How was it ?Harry considered for a moment .Wet he said truthfully .Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust it was hard to tell .Because she was crying Harry continued heavily .Oh said Ron his smile fading slightly .Are you that bad at kissing ?Dunno said Harry who hadnt considered this and immediately felt rather worried .Maybe I am .Of course youre not said Hermione absently still scribbling away at her letter .How do you know ?said Ron in a sharp voice .Because Cho spends half her time crying these days said Hermione vaguely .She does it at mealtimes in the loos all over the place .Youd think a bit of kissing would cheer her up said Ron grinning .Ron said Hermione in a dignified voice dipping the point of her quill into her ink pot you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet .Whats that supposed to mean ?said Ron indignantly .What sort of person cries while someones kissing them ?Yeah said Harry slightly desperately who does ?Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face .Dont you understand how Chos feeling at the moment ?she asked .No said Harry and Ron together .Hermione sighed and laid down her quill .Well obviously shes feeling very sad because of Cedric dying .Then I expect shes feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry and she cant work out who she likes best .Then shell be feeling guilty thinking its an insult to Cedrics memory to be kissing Harry at all and shell be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry .And she probably cant work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died so thats all very mixed up and painful .Oh and shes afraid shes going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because shes been flying so badly .A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech then Ron said One person cant feel all that at once theyd explode .Just because youve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesnt mean we all have said Hermione nastily picking up her quill again .She was the one who started it said Harry .I wouldntve she just sort of came at me and next thing shes crying all over me I didnt know what to do Dont blame you mate said Ron looking alarmed at the very thought .You just had to be nice to her said Hermione looking up anxiously .You were werent you ?Well said Harry an unpleasant heat creeping up his face I sort of patted her on the back a bit .Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty .Well I suppose it could have been worse she said .Are you going to see her again ?Ill have to wont I ?said Harry .Weve got D .A .meetings havent we ?You know what I mean said Hermione impatiently .Harry said nothing .Hermione s words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities .He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho Hogsmeade perhaps and being alone with her for hours at a time .Of course she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened .The thought made his stomach clench painfully .Oh well said Hermione distantly buried in her letter once more youll have plenty of opportunities to ask her .What if he doesnt want to ask her ?said Ron who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face .Dont be silly said Hermione vaguely Harrys liked her for ages havent you Harry ?He did not answer .Yes he had liked Cho for ages but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder .Who re you writing the novel to anyway ?Ron asked Hermione trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor .Hermione hitched it up out of sight .Viktor .Krum ?How many other Viktors do we know ?Ron said nothing but looked disgruntled .They sat in silence for another twenty minutes Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossingsout Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment rolling it up carefully and sealing it and Harry staring into the fire wishing more than anything that Siriuss head would appear there and give him some advice about girls .But the fire merely crackled lower and lower until the redhot embers crumbled into ash and looking around Harry saw that they were yet again the last in the common room .Well night said Hermione yawning widely and she set off up the girls staircase .What does she see in Krum ?Ron demanded as he and Harry climbed the boys stairs .Well said Harry considering the matter I spose hes older isnt he .and hes an international Quidditch player .Yeah but apart from that said Ron sounding aggravated .I mean hes a grouchy git isnt he ?Bit grouchy yeah said Harry whose thoughts were still on Cho .They pulled off their robes and put on pajamas in silence Dean Seamus and Neville were already asleep .Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his fourposter instead he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Nevilles bed .If he had known this time last night that in twentyfour hours time he would have kissed Cho Chang .Night grunted Ron from somewhere to his right .Night said Harry .Maybe next time .if there was a next time .shed be a bit happier .He ought to have asked her out she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him .or was she lying in bed still crying about Cedric ?He did not know what to think .Hermiones explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand .Thats what they should teach us here he thought turning over onto his side how girls brains work .itd be more useful than Divination anyway .Neville snuffled in his sleep .An owl hooted somewhere out in the night .Harry dreamed he was back in the D .A .room .Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretenses she said that he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if she showed up .Harry protested .Cho shouted Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog cards look And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air and then turned into Hermione who said You did promise her you know Harry .I think youd better give her something else instead .How about your Firebolt ?And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt because Umbridge had it and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous hed only come to the D .A .room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobbys head .The dream changed .His body felt smooth powerful and flexible .He was gliding between shining metal bars across dark cold stone .He was flat against the floor sliding along on his belly .It was dark yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange vibrant colors .He was turning his head .At first glance the corridor was empty .but no .a man was sitting on the floor ahead his chin drooping onto his chest his outline gleaming in the dark .Harry put out his tongue .He tasted the mans scent on the air .He was alive but drowsing .sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor .Harry longed to bite the man .but he must master the impulse .He had more important work to do .But the man was stirring .a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet and Harry saw his vibrant blurred outline towering above him saw a wand withdrawn from a belt .He had no choice .He reared high from the floor and struck once twice three times plunging his fangs deeply into the mans flesh feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws feeling the warm gush of blood .The man was yelling in pain .then he fell silent .He slumped backward against the wall .Blood was splattering onto the floor .His forehead hurt terribly .It was aching fit to burst .Harry !HARRY !He opened his eyes .Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket he felt as though a whitehot poker was being applied to his forehead .Harryl Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened .There were more figures at the foot of Harrys bed .He clutched his head in his hands the pain was blinding him .He rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress .Hes really ill said a scared voice .Should we call someone ?Harry !Harryl He had to tell Ron it was very important that he tell him .Taking great gulps of air Harry pushed himself up in bed willing himself not to throw up again the pain halfblinding him .Your dad he panted his chest heaving .Your dads .been attacked .What ?said Ron uncomprehendingly .Your dad !Hes been bitten its serious there was blood everywhere .Im going for help said the same scared voice and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory .Harry mate said Ron uncertainly you .you were just dreaming .No !said Harry furiously it was crucial that Ron understand .It wasnt a dream .not an ordinary dream .I was there I saw it .I did it .He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care .The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly .He retched again and Ron leapt backward out of the way .Harry youre not well he said shakily .Nevilles gone for help .Im fine !Harry choked wiping his mouth on his pajamas and shaking uncontrollably .Theres nothing wrong with me its your dad youve got to worry about we need to find out where he is hes bleeding like mad I was it was a huge snake .He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby .Whether one minute passed or ten Harry did not know he simply sat there shaking feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar .Then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs and he heard Nevilles voice again .Over here Professor .Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose .What is it Potter ?Where does it hurt ?He had never been so pleased to see her it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions .Its Rons dad he said sitting up again .Hes been attacked by a snake and its serious I saw it happen .What do you mean you saw it happen ?said Professor McGonagall her dark eyebrows contracting .I dont know .I was asleep and then I was there .You mean you dreamed this ?No !said Harry angrily .Would none of them understand ?I was having a dream at first about something completely different something stupid .and then this interrupted it .It was real I didnt imagine it Mr Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake there was a load of blood he collapsed someones got to find out where he is .Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing .Im not lying and Im not mad !Harry told her his voice rising to a shout .I tell you I saw it happen !I believe you Potter said Professor McGonagall curtly .Put on your dressinggown were going to see the headmaster .ST .MUNGOS HOSPITAL FOR MAGICAL MALADIES AND INJURIES Harry was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back onto his nose .Weasley you ought to come too said Professor McGonagall .They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville Dean and Seamus out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room through the portrait hole and off along the Fat Ladys moonlit corridor .Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment he wanted to run to yell for Dumbledore .Mr Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs Harry tried hard not to think my fangs had been poisonous ?They passed Mrs Norris who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but Professor McGonagall said Shoo !Mrs Norris slunk away into the shadows and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledores office .Fizzing Whizbee said Professor McGonagall .The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator .The three of them stepped onto the moving stairs the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin .Though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room a positive babble of them .It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people .Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off .The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside .The room was in half darkness the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did .The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames .Behind the door a magnificent redandgold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing .Oh its you Professor McGonagall .and .ah .Dumbledore was sitting in a highbacked chair behind his desk he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him .He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purpleandgold dressing gown over a snowywhite nightshirt but seemed wide awake his penetrating lightblue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall .Professor Dumbledore Potter has had a .well a nightmare said Professor McGonagall .He says .It wasnt a nightmare said Harry quickly .Professor McGonagall looked around at Harry frowning slightly .Very well then Potter you tell the headmaster about it . ~ I .well I was asleep .said Harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him but examining his own interlocked fingers .But it wasnt an ordinary dream .it was real .I saw it happen .He took a deep breath Rons dad Mr Weasley has been attacked by a giant snake .The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them slightly ridiculous even comic .There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling .Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore whitefaced and shocked .How did you see this ?Dumbledore asked quietly still not looking at Harry .Well .I dont know said Harry rather angrily what did it matter ?Inside my head I suppose You misunderstand me said Dumbledore still in the same calm tone .I mean .can you remember er where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen ?Were you perhaps standing beside the victim or else looking down on the scene from above ?This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore it was almost as though he knew .I was the snake he said .I saw it all from the snakes point of view .Nobody else spoke for a moment then Dumbledore now looking at Ron who was still wheyfaced said in a new and sharper voice Is Arthur seriously injured ?Yes said Harry emphatically why were they all so slow on the uptake did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side ?And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him ?But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling .Everard ?he said sharply .And you too Dilys !A sallowfaced wizard with short black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps opened their eyes immediately .You were listening ?said Dumbledore .The wizard nodded the witch said Naturally .The man has red hair and glasses said Dumbledore .Everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures as usually happened at Hogwarts neither reappeared one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair .Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls though snoring and drooling most convincingly kept sneaking peeks at him under their eyelids and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked .Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts s most celebrated Heads Dumbledore said now sweeping around Harry Ron and Professor McGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door .Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important Wizarding institutions .As they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere .But Mr Weasley could be anywhere !said Harry .Please sit down all three of you said Dumbledore as though Harry had not spoken .Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes .Professor McGonagall if you could draw up extra chairs .Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it three chairs appeared out of thin air straightbacked and wooden quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harrys hearing .Harry sat down watching Dumbledore over his shoulder .Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkess plumed golden head with one finger .The phoenix awoke immediately .He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright dark eyes .We will need said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird a warning .There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone .Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known carried it over to his desk sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand .The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises .Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top .Dumbledore watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed and after a few seconds the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air .A serpents head grew out of the end of it opening its mouth wide .Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story He looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right but Dumbledore did not look up .Naturally naturally murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise .But in essence divided ?Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question .The smoke serpent however split itself instantly into two snakes both coiling and undulating in the dark air .With a look of grim satisfaction Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand The clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint became a formless haze and vanished .Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes then realizing that Harry was watching them hastily pretend to be sleeping again .Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for but before he could do so there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait panting slightly .Dumbledore !What news ?said Dumbledore at once .I yelled until someone came running said the wizard who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him said Id heard something moving downstairs they werent sure whether to believe me but went down to check you know there are no portraits down there to watch from .Anyway they carried him up a few minutes later .He doesnt look good hes covered in blood I ran along to Elfrida Craggs portrait to get a good view as they left Good said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive then And moments later the silverringletted witch had reappeared in her picture too she sank coughing into her armchair and said Yes theyve taken him to St .Mungos Dumbledore .They carried him past under my portrait .He looks bad .Thank you said Dumbledore .He looked around at Professor McGonagall .Minerva I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children .Of course .Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron who was now looking terrified .And Dumbledore what about Molly ?said Professor McGonagall pausing at the door .That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching said Dumbledore .But she may already know .that excellent clock of hers .Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told not the time but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members and with a pang he thought that Mr Weasleys hand must even now be pointing at mortal peril .But it was very late .Mrs Weasley was probably asleep not watching the clock .And he felt cold as he remembered Mrs Weasleys boggart turning into Mr Weasleys lifeless body his glasses askew blood running down his face .But Mr Weasley wasnt going to die .He couldnt .Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron .He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully upon his desk .He raised his wand and murmured Portus for a moment the kettle trembled glowing with an odd blue light then it quivered to a rest as solidly black as ever .Dumbledore marched over to another portrait this time of a cleverlooking wizard with a pointed beard who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore s voice when he attempted to rouse him .Phineas .Phineas .And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep they were shifting around in their frames the better to watch what was happening .When the cleverlooking wizard continued to feign sleep some of them shouted his name too .Phineas !Phineas !PHINEAS !He could not pretend any longer he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide .Did someone call ?I need you to visit your other portrait again Phineas said Dumbledore .IVe got another message .Visit my other portrait ?said Phineas in a reedy voice giving a long fake yawn his eyes traveling around the room and focusing upon Harry .Oh no Dumbledore I am too tired tonight .Something about Phineas s voice was familiar to Harry .Where had he heard it before ?But before he could think the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest .Insubordination sir !roared a corpulent rednosed wizard brandishing his fists .Dereliction of duty !We are honorbound to give service to the present Headmaster of Hogwarts !cried a fraillooking old wizard whom Harry recognized as Dumbledores predecessor Armando Dippet .Shame on you Phineas !Shall I persuade him Dumbledore ?called a gimlet eyed witch raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod .Oh very well said the wizard called Phineas eyeing this wand slightly apprehensively though he may well have destroyed my picture by now hes done most of the family Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait said Dumbledore and Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas s voice before issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place .You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife children and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly .Do you understand ?Arthur Weasley injured wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay recited Phineas in a bored voice .Yes yes .very well .He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment that the study door opened again .Fred George and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall all three of them looking disheveled and shocked still in their night things .Harry whats going on ?asked Ginny who looked frightened .Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix said Dumbledore before Harry could speak .He has been taken to St .Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries .I am sending you back to Siriuss house which is much more convenient for the hospital than the Burrow .You will meet your mother there .Howre we going ?asked Fred looking shaken .Floo powder ?No said Dumbledore Floo powder is not safe at the moment the Network is being watched .You will be taking a Portkey .He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk .We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back .I wish to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor .It is Fawkess warning said Dumbledore catching the feather as it fell .She must know youre out of your beds .Minerva go and head her off tell her any story Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan .He says hell be delighted said a bored voice behind Dumbledore the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner .My greatgreatgrandson has always had odd taste in houseguests .Come here then Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys .And quickly before anyone else joins us Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledores desk .You have all used a Portkey before ?asked Dumbledore and they nodded each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle .Good .On the count of three then .one .two .It happened in a fraction of a second In the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said three Harry looked up at him they were very close together and Dumbledores clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harrys face .At once Harrys scar burned whitehot as though the old wound had burst open again and unbidden unwanted but terrifyingly strong there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt for that instant that he would like nothing better than to strike to bite to sink his fangs into the man before him .three .He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel the ground vanished from beneath his feet his hand was glued to the kettle he was banging into the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind the kettle pulling them onward and then His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said Back again the blood traitor brats is it true their fathers dying . ?OUT !roared a second voice .Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve Grimmauld Place .The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper .Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth Sirius was hurrying toward them all looking anxious .He was unshaven and still in his day clothes there was also a slightly Mundunguslike whiff of stale drink about him .Whats going on ?he said stretching out a hand to help Ginny up .Phineas Nigellus said Arthurs been badly injured Ask Harry said Fred .Yeah I want to hear this for myself said George .The twins and Ginny were staring at him .Kreachers footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside .It was Harry began this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore .I had a a kind of vision .And he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked rather than from behind the snakes own eyes .Ron who was still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak .When Harry had finished Fred George and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment .Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks .Well if they were going to blame him for just seeing the attack he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time .Is Mum here ?said Fred turning to Sirius .She probably doesnt even know whats happened yet said Sirius .The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere .I expect Dumbledores letting Molly know now .Weve got to go to St .Mungos said Ginny urgently .She looked around at her brothers they were of course still in their pajamas .Sirius can you lend us cloaks or anything ?Hang on you cant go tearing off to St .Mungos !said Sirius .Course we can go to St .Mungos if we want said Fred with a mulish expression hes our dad !And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know ?What does that matter ?said George hotly .It matters because we dont want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away !said Sirius angrily .Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information ?Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything .Ron was still whitefaced and silent .Ginny said Somebody else could have told us .We could have heard it somewhere other than Harry .Like who ?said Sirius impatiently .Listen your dads been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened you could seriously damage the Orders We dont care about the dumb Order !shouted Fred .Its our dad dying were talking about !yelled George .Your father knew what he was getting into and he wont thank you for messing things up for the Order !said Sirius angrily in his turn .This is how it is this is why youre not in the Order you dont understand there are things worth dying for !Easy for you to say stuck here !bellowed Fred .I dont see you risking your neck !The little color remaining in Siriuss face drained from it .He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred but when he spoke it was in a voice of determined calm .I know its hard but weve all got to act as though we dont know anything yet .Weve got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right ?Fred and George still looked mutinous .Ginny however took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it .Harry looked at Ron who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug and they sat down too .The twins glared at Sirius for another minute then took seats on either side of Ginny .Thats right said Sirius encouragingly come on lets all .lets all have a drink while were waiting .Accio Butterbeeri He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying toward them out of the pantry skidded along the table scattering the debris of Siriuss meal and stopped neatly in front of the six of them .They all drank and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table .Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands .His stomach was full of horrible hot bubbling guilt .They would not be here if it were not for him they would all still be asleep in bed .And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr Weasley was found because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr Weasley in the first place .Dont be stupid you havent got fangs he told himself trying to keep calm though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking .You were lying in bed you werent attacking anyone .But then what just happened in Dumbledores office ?he asked himself .I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too .He put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant to so that it slopped over onto the table .No one took any notice .Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as they gave cries of shock a scroll of parchment fell with a thud onto the table accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather .Fawkes !said Sirius at once snatching up the parchment .Thats not Dumbledores writing it must be a message from your mother here He thrust the letter into Georges hand who ripped it open and read aloud Dad is still alive .I am setting out for St .Mungos now .Stay where you are .I will send news as soon as I can .Mum .George looked around the table .Still alive .he said slowly .But that makes it sound .He did not need to finish the sentence .It sounded to Harry too as though Mr Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death .Still exceptionally pale Ron stared at the back of his mothers letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him .Fred pulled the parchment out of Georges hands and read it for himself then looked up at Harry who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling .If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it .Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed but without any real conviction and the Weasleys looks of disgust were answer enough .They mostly sat in silence around the table watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax now and then raising bottles to their lips speaking only to check the time to wonder aloud what was happening and to reassure one another that if there was bad news they would know straightaway for Mrs Weasley must long since have arrived at St .Mungos .Fred fell into a doze his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder .Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair but her eyes were open Harry could see them reflecting the firelight .Ron was sitting with his head in his hands whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell .And he and Sirius looked at each other every so often intruders upon the family grief waiting .waiting .And then at ten past five in the morning by Rons watch the kitchen door swung open and Mrs Weasley entered the kitchen .She was extremely pale but when they all turned to look at her Fred Ron and Harry halfrising from their chairs she gave a wan smile .Hes going to be all right she said her voice weak with tiredness .Hes sleeping .We can all go and see him later .Bills sitting with him now hes going to take the morning off work .Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face .George and Ginny got up walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her .Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one .Breakfast !said Sirius loudly and joyfully jumping to his feet .Wheres that accursed houseelf ?Kreacher !KREACHER !But Kreacher did not answer the summons .Oh forget it then muttered Sirius counting the people in front of him .So its breakfast for lets see seven .Bacon and eggs I think and some tea and toast Harry hurried over to the stove to help .He did not want to intrude upon the Weasleys happiness and he dreaded the moment when Mrs Weasley would ask him to recount his vision .However he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug .I dont know what would have happened if it hadnt been for you Harry she said in a muffled voice .They might not have found Arthur for hours and then it would have been too late but thanks to you hes alive and Dumbledores been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was youve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise look at poor Sturgis .Harry could hardly stand her gratitude but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night .Sirius said that he was very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr Weasley was in hospital .Oh Sirius Im so grateful .They think hell be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer .Of course that might mean were here for Christmas .The more the merrier !said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs Weasley beamed at him threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast .Sirius Harry muttered unable to stand it a moment longer .Can I have a quick word ?Er now ?He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed .Without preamble Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr Weasley .When he paused for breath Sirius said Did you tell Dumbledore this ?Yes said Harry impatiently but he didnt tell me what it meant .Well he doesnt tell me anything anymore .Im sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about said Sirius steadily .But thats not all said Harry in a voice only a little above a whisper .Sirius I .I think Im going mad .Back in Dumbledores office just before we took the Portkey .for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake I felt like one my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore Sirius I wanted to attack him He could only see a sliver of Siriuss face the rest was in darkness .It must have been the aftermath of the vision thats all said Sirius .You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and It wasnt that said Harry shaking his head .It was like something rose up inside me like theres a snake inside me You need to sleep said Sirius firmly .Youre going to have breakfast and then go upstairs to bed and then you can go and see Arthur after lunch with the others .Youre in shock Harry youre blaming yourself for something you only witnessed and its lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died .Just stop worrying .He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry leaving Harry standing alone in the dark .Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping .He went up to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes Harry sat fully clothed hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable determined not to fall into a doze terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake to find that he had attacked Ron or else slithered through the house after one of the others .When Ron woke up Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too .Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St .Mungos .Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts and they greeted Tonks and Mad Eye who had turned up to escort them across London gleefully laughing at the bowler hat MadEye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him truthfully that Tonks whose hair was short and bright pink again would attract far less attention on the underground .Tonks was very interested in Harrys vision of the attack on Mr Weasley something he was not remotely interested in discussing .There isnt any Seer blood in your family is there ?she inquired curiously as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart of the city .No said Harry thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted .No said Tonks musingly no I suppose its not really prophecy youre doing is it ?I mean youre not seeing the future youre seeing the present .Its odd isnt it ?Useful though .Harry did not answer fortunately they got out at the next stop a station in the very heart of London and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks who was leading the way .They all followed her up the escalator Moody clunking along at the back of the group his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat clutching his wand .Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him trying to deflect more questions about his dream he asked MadEye where St .Mungos was hidden .Not far from here grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad storelined street packed with Christmas shoppers .He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat .Wasnt easy to find a good location for a hospital .Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldnt have it underground like the Ministry unhealthy .In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here .Theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd .He seized Harrys shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets .Here we go said Moody a moment later .They had arrived outside a large oldfashioned red brick department store called Purge and Dowse Ltd .The place had a shabby miserable air the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew standing at random and modeling fashions at least ten years out of date .Large signs on all the dusty doors read CLOSED FOR REFURBISHMENT .Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed Its never open that place .Right said Tonks beckoning them forward to a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eyelashes were hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore dress .Everybody ready ?They nodded clustering around her Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass looking up at the very ugly dummy and said her breath steaming up the glass Wotcher .Were here to see Arthur Weasley .For a split second Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of glass when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers .Then he reminded himself that dummies could not hear anyway .Next second his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod beckoned its jointed finger and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs Weasley by the elbows stepped right through the glass and vanished .Fred George and Ron stepped after them Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd .s nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them .Cmon growled Moody giving Harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water emerging quite warm and dry on the other side .There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood .They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs some looking perfectly normal and perusing out of date copies of Witch Weekly others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests .The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises .A sweatyfaced witch in the center of the front row who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet kept letting off a highpitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth and a grubbylooking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and with each clang his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady .Witches and wizards in limegreen robes were walking up and down the rows asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridges .Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests a wand and bone crossed .Are they doctors ?he asked Ron quietly .Doctors ?said Ron looking startled .Those Muggle nutters that cut people up ?Nah theyre Healers .Over here !called Mrs Weasley over the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked inquiries .The wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like A CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE ANTIDONTS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER .There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets that was labelled DILYS DERWENT ST .MUNGOS HEALER 17221741 HEADMISTRESS OF HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY I74II768 Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party as though counting them when Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished .Meanwhile at the front of the queue a young wizard was performing an odd onthespot jig and trying in between yelps of pain to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk .Its these ouch shoes my brother gave me ow theyre eating my OUCH feet look at them there must be some kind of AARGH jinx on them and I cant aaRGH get them off He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals .The shoes dont prevent you reading do they ?said the blonde witch irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk .You want Spell Damage fourth floor .Just like it says on the floor guide .Next !The wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way the Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide ARTIFACT ACCIDENTS Ground Floor Cauldron explosion wand backfiring broom crashes etc .CREATUREINDUCED INJURIES First Floor Bites stings burns embedded spines etc .MAGICAL BUGS Second Floor Contagious maladies e .g .dragon pox vanishing sickness scrofungulus POTION AND PLANT POISONING ..Third Floor Rashes regurgitation uncontrollable giggling etc .SPELL DAMAGE Fourth Floor Unliftable jinxes hexes and incorrectly applied charms etc .VISITORS TEAROOM AND HOSPITAL SHOP .Fifth Floor If you are unsure where to go incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here our Welcome Witch will be pleased to help .A very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now .Im here to see Broderick Bode !he wheezed .Ward fortynine but Im afraid youre wasting your time said the witch dismissively Hes completely addled you know still thinks hes a teapot .Next !A harassedlooking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large feathery wings that had sprouted right out the back of her romper suit .Fourth floor said the witch in a bored voice without asking and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon .Next !Mrs Weasley moved forward to the desk .Hello she said .My husband Arthur Weasley was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning could you tell us ?Arthur Weasley ?said the witch running her finger down a long list in front of her .Yes first floor second door on the right Dai Llewellyn ward .Thank you said Mrs Weasley .Come on you lot .They followed through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling looking like giant soapsuds .More witches and wizards in limegreen robes walked in and out of the doors they passed a foulsmelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door and every now and then they heard distant wailing .They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the CreatureInduced Injuries corridor where the second door on the right bore the words DANGEROUS DAI LLEWELLYN WARD SERIOUS BITES .Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten HealerinCharge Hippocrates Smethwyck Trainee Healer Augustus Pye .Well wait outside Molly Tonks said .Arthur wont want too many visitors at once .It ought to be just the family first .MadEye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall his magical eye spinning in all directions .Harry drew back too but Mrs Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying Dont be silly Harry Arthur wants to thank you .The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door .Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling .The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather viciouslooking wizard on the wall captioned URQUHART RACKHARROW 16121697 INVENTOR OF THE ENTRAIL EXPELLING CURSE .There were only three patients .Mr Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window .Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed .He looked around as they walked toward him and seeing whom it was beamed .Hello !he called throwing the Prophet aside .Bill just left Molly had to get back to work but he says hell drop in on you later .How are you Arthur ?asked Mrs Weasley bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face .Youre still looking a bit peaky .I feel absolutely fine said Mr Weasley brightly holding out his good arm to give Ginny a hug .If they could only take the bandages off Id be fit to go home .Why cant they take them off Dad ?asked Fred .Well I start bleeding like mad every time they try said Mr Weasley cheerfully reaching across for his wand which lay on his bedside cabinet and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all .It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snakes fangs that keeps wounds open .Theyre sure theyll find an antidote though they say theyve had much worse cases than mine and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a BloodReplenishing Potion every hour .But that fellow over there he said dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling .Bitten by a werewolf poor chap .No cure at all .A werewolf ?whispered Mrs Weasley looking alarmed .Is he safe in a public ward ?Shouldnt he be in a private room ?Its two weeks till full moon Mr Weasley reminded her quietly .Theyve been talking to him this morning the Healers you know trying to persuade him hell be able to lead an almost normal life .I said to him didnt mention names of course but I said I knew a werewolf personally very nice man who finds the condition quite easy to manage .What did he say ?asked George .Said hed give me another bite if I didnt shut up said Mr Weasley sadly .And that woman over there he indicated the only other occupied bed which was right beside the door wont tell the Healers what bit her which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally .Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg very nasty smell when they take off the dressings .So you going to tell us what happened Dad ?asked Fred pulling his chair closer to the bed .Well you already know dont you ?said Mr Weasley with a significant smile at Harry .Its very simple Id had a very long day dozed off got sneaked up on and bitten .Is it in the Prophet you being attacked ?asked Fred indicating the newspaper Mr Weasley had cast aside .No of course not said Mr Weasley with a slightly bitter smile the Ministry wouldnt want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got Arthur !said Mrs Weasley warningly .got er me Mr Weasley said hastily though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say .So where were you when it happened Dad ?asked George .Thats my business said Mr Weasley though with a small smile .He snatched up the Daily Prophet shook it open again and said I was just reading about Willy Widdershinss arrest when you arrived .You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer ?One of his jinxes backfired the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in When you say you were ‘on duty Fred interrupted in a low voice what were you doing ?You heard your father whispered Mrs Weasley we are not discussing this here !Go on about Willy Widdershins Arthur Well dont ask me how but he actually got off on the toilet charge said Mr Weasley grimly .I can only suppose gold changed hands You were guarding it werent you ?said George quietly .The weapon ?The thing YouKnow Whos after ?George be quiet !snapped Mrs Weasley .Anyway said Mr Weasley in a raised voice this time Willys been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles and I dont think hell be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St .Mungos for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification .Just think of it Muggles in St .Mungos !I wonder which ward theyre in ?And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost .Didnt you say YouKnow Whos got a snake Harry ?asked Fred looking at his father for a reaction .A massive one ?You saw it the night he returned didnt you ?Thats enough said Mrs Weasley crossly .MadEye and Tonks are outside Arthur they want to come and see you .And you lot can wait outside she added to her children and Harry .You can come and say goodbye afterward .Go on .They trooped back into the corridor .MadEye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them .Fred raised his eyebrows .Fine he said coolly rummaging in his pockets be like that .Dont tell us anything .Looking for these ?said George holding out what looked like a tangle of fleshcolored string .You read my mind said Fred grinning .Lets see if St .Mungos puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors shall we ?He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other .Fred and George handed them around .Harry hesitated to take one .Go on Harry take it !You saved Dads life if anyones got the right to eavesdrop on him its you .Grinning in spite of himself Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done .Okay go !Fred whispered .The fleshcolored strings wriggled like long skinny worms then snaked under the door .For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing then he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him . .they searched the whole area but they couldnt find the snake anywhere it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you Arthur .But You KnowWho cant have expected a snake to get in can he ?I reckon he sent it as a lookout growled Moody cause hes not had any luck so far has he ?No I reckon hes trying to get a clearer picture of what hes facing and if Arthur hadnt been there the beast wouldve had much more time to look around .So Potter says he saw it all happen ?Yes said Mrs Weasley .She sounded rather uneasy .You know Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this .Yeah well said Moody theres something funny about the Potter kid we all know that .Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning whispered Mrs Weasley .Course hes worried growled Moody .The boys seeing things from inside YouKnow Whos snake .Obviously Potter doesnt realize what that means but if You Know Whos possessing him Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face .He looked around at the others .They were all staring at him the strings still trailing from their ears looking suddenly fearful .CHRISTMAS ON THE CLOSED WARD Was this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harrys eyes ?Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them afraid perhaps that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet with catlike slits for pupils ?Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrells head and he ran his hand over the back of his own wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull .He felt dirty contaminated as though he were carrying some deadly germ unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort .He had not merely seen the snake he had been the snake he knew it now .And then a truly terrible thought occurred to him a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents .Whats he after apart from followers ?Stuff he can only get by stealth .like a weapon .Something he didnt have last time .Im the weapon Harry thought and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins chilling him bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel .Im the one Voldemorts trying to use thats why theyve got guards around me everywhere I go its not for my protection its for other peoples only its not working they cant have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts .I did attack Mr Weasley last night it was me Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me listening to my thoughts right now .Are you all right Harry dear ?whispered Mrs Weasley leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel .You dont look very well .Are you feeling sick ?They were all watching him .He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance .Harry dear are you sure youre all right ?said Mrs Weasley in a worried voice as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place .You look ever so pale .Are you sure you slept this morning ?You go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours sleep before dinner all right ?He nodded here was a readymade excuse not to talk to any of the others which was precisely what he wanted so when she opened the front door he proceeded straight past the trolls leg umbrella stand and up the stairs and hurried into his and Rons bedroom .Here he began to pace up and down past the two beds and Phineas Nigelluss empty portrait his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas .How had he become a snake ?Perhaps he was an Animagus .No he couldnt be he would know .perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus .Yes thought Harry that would fit he would turn into a snake of course .and when hes possessing me then we both transform .That still doesnt explain how come I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes though .But then Voldemort s about the most powerful wizard in the world apart from Dumbledore its probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that .And then with a terrible stab of panic he thought but this is insane if Voldemorts possessing me Im giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now !Hell know whos in the Order and where Sirius is .and Ive heard loads of stuff I shouldnt have everything Sirius told me the first night I was here .There was only one thing for it He would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway .He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others which would keep them safe over the holidays at least .But no that wouldnt do there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure what if it was Seamus Dean or Neville next time ?He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigelluss empty frame .A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach .He had no alternative He was going to have to return to Privet Drive cut himself off from other wizards entirely .Well if he had to do it he thought there was no point hanging around .Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected he strode over to his trunk slammed the lid shut and locked it then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts well her cage would be one less thing to carry he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway toward the door when a sneaky voice said Running away are we ?He looked around .Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame watching Harry with an amused expression on his face .Not running away no said Harry shortly dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room .I thought said Phineas Nigellus stroking his pointed beard that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave ?It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house .We Slytherins are brave yes but not stupid .For instance given the choice we will always choose to save our own necks .Its not my own neck Im saving said Harry tersely tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven motheaten carpet right in front of the door .Oh I see said Phineas Nigellus still stroking his beard .This is no cowardly flight you are being noble .Harry ignored him .His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore .Harry spun around .What is it ?Stay where you are .I havent moved !said Harry his hand still upon the doorknob .So whats the message ?I have just given it to you dolt said Phineas Nigellus smoothly .Dumbledore says ‘Stay where you are .Why ?said Harry eagerly dropping the end of his trunk .Why does he want me to stay ?What else did he say ?Nothing whatsoever said Phineas Nigellus raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent .Harrys temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass .He was exhausted he was confused beyond measure he had experienced terror relief and then terror again in the last twelve hours and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him !So thats it is it ?he said loudly .Stay there ?Thats all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too !Just stay put while the grownups sort it out Harry !We wont bother telling you anything though because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it !You know said Phineas Nigellus even more loudly than Harry this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher !Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything .Has it not occurred to you my poor puffedup popinjay that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you ?Have you never paused while feeling harddoneby to note that following Dumbledore s orders has never yet led you into harm ?No .No like all young people you are quite sure that you alone feel and think you alone recognize danger you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning .He is planning something to do with me then ?said Harry swiftly .Did I say that ?said Phineas Nigellus idly examining his silk gloves .Now if you will excuse me I have better things to do than to listen to adolescent agonizing .Good day to you .And he strolled into his frame and out of sight .Fine go then !Harry bellowed at the empty frame .And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing !The empty canvas remained silent .Fuming Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed then threw himself facedown upon the motheaten covers his eyes shut his body heavy and aching .He felt he had journeyed miles and miles .It seemed impossible that less than twentyfour hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe .He was so tired .He was scared to sleep .yet he did not know how long he could fight it .Dumbledore had told him to stay .That must mean he was allowed to sleep .But he was scared .What if it happened again . ?He was sinking into shadows .It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start .He was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door past rough stone walls torches and an open doorway onto a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left .He reached the black door but could not open it .He stood gazing at it desperate for entry .Something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond .A prize beyond his dreams .If only his scar would stop prickling .then he would be able to think more clearly .Harry said Rons voice from far far away Mum says dinners ready but shell save you something if you want to stay in bed .Harry opened his eyes but Ron had already left the room .He doesnt want to be on his own with me Harry thought .Not after what he heard Moody say .He supposed none of them would want him there anymore now that they knew what was inside him .He would not go down to dinner he would not inflict his company upon them .He turned over onto his other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep waking much later in the early hours of the morning with his insides aching with hunger and Ron snoring in the next bed .Squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch over him in case he attacked somebody else .The feeling of being unclean intensified .He half wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore and stayed .If this was how life was going to be in Grimmauld Place from now on maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all .Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations .Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood he was actually singing carols apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas .Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where he was sitting alone watching the sky outside the windows growing whiter threatening snow all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him as they were bound to be doing .When he heard Mrs Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her .It was around six oclock in the evening that the doorbell rang and Mrs Black started screaming again .Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriffs room where he was hiding trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats .It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later .I know youre in there said Hermiones voice .Will you please come out ?I want to talk to you .What are you doing here ?Harry asked her pulling open the door as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the strawstrewn floor for any fragments of rat he might have dropped .I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad .Well to tell the truth skiings not really my thing said Hermione .So Ive come for Christmas .There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold .But dont tell Ron that I told him its really good because he kept laughing so much .Anyway Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed but Ive told them that everyone whos serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study .They want me to do well theyll understand .Anyway she said briskly lets go to your bedroom Rons mums lit a fire in there and shes sent up sandwiches .Harry followed her back to the second floor .When he entered the bedroom he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them sitting on Rons bed .I came on the Knight Bus said Hermione airily pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak .Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off .Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose even though Dumbledore told her Mr Weasley was in St .Mungos and hed given you all permission to visit .So She sat down next to Ginny and the two girls and Ron looked up at Harry .Howre you feeling ?asked Hermione .Fine said Harry stiffly .Oh dont lie Harry she said impatiently .Ron and Ginny say youve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St .Mungos .They do do they ?said Harry glaring at Ron and Ginny .Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed .Well you have !she said .And you wont look at any of us !Its you lot who wont look at me !said Harry angrily .Maybe youre taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other suggested Hermione the corners of her mouth twitching .Very funny snapped Harry turning away .Oh stop feeling all misunderstood said Hermione sharply .Look the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears Yeah ?growled Harry his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside .All been talking about me have you ?Well Im getting used to it .We wanted to talk to you Harry said Ginny but as youve been hiding ever since we got back I didnt want anyone to talk to me said Harry who was feeling more and more nettled .Well that was a bit stupid of you said Ginny angrily seeing as you dont know anyone but me whos been possessed by YouKnowWho and I can tell you how it feels .Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him .Then he turned on the spot to face her .I forgot he said .Lucky you said Ginny coolly .Im sorry Harry said and he meant it .So .so do you think Im being possessed then ?Well can you remember everything youve been doing ?Ginny asked .Are there big blank periods where you dont know what youve been up to ?Harry racked his brains .No he said .Then YouKnowWho hasnt ever possessed you said Ginny simply .When he did it to me I couldnt remember what Id been doing for hours at a time .Id find myself somewhere and not know how I got there .Harry hardly dared believe her yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself .That dream I had about your dad and the snake though Harry youve had these dreams before Hermione said .You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year .This was different said Harry shaking his head .I was inside that snake .It was like I was the snake .What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London ?One day said Hermione sounding thoroughly exasperated youll read Hogwarts A History and perhaps that will remind you that you cant Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts .Even Voldemort couldnt just make you fly out of your dormitory Harry .You didnt leave your bed mate said Ron .I saw you thrashing around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up .Harry started pacing up and down the room again thinking .What they were all saying was not only comforting it made sense .Without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth .Im not the weapon after all thought Harry .His heart swelled with happiness and relief and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door toward Buckbeaks room singing God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs at the top of his voice .How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas ?Siriuss delight at having the house full again and especially at having Harry back was infectious .He was no longer their sullen host of the summer now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much if not more than they would have done at Hogwarts and he worked tirelessly in the runup to Christmas Day cleaning and decorating with their help so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable .The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets a great Christmas tree obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies blocked Siriuss family tree from view and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards .Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own rather larger pile .Good haul this year he informed Harry through a cloud of paper .Thanks for the Broom Compass its excellent beats Hermiones shes got me a homework planner Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermiones handwriting on it .She had given him too a book that resembled a diary except that it said things like Do it today or later youll pay every time he opened a page .Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts which had superb moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described .Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D .A .Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off .Tonkss present was a small working model of a Firebolt which Harry watched fly around the room wishing he still had his fullsize version Ron had given him an enormous box of EveryFlavor Beans Mr and Mrs Weasley the usual handknitted jumper and some mince pies and Dobby a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself .He had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better that way when with a loud crack Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed .Merry Christmas said George .Dont go downstairs for a bit .Why not ?said Ron .Mums crying again said Fred heavily .Percy sent back his Christmas jumper .Without a note added George .Hasnt asked how Dad is or visited him or anything .We tried to comfort her said Fred moving around the bed to look at Harrys portrait .Told her Percys nothing more than a humongous pile of rat droppings didnt work said George helping himself to a Chocolate Frog .So Lupin took over .Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast I reckon .Whats that supposed to be anyway ?asked Fred squinting at Dobbys painting .Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes .Its Harry !said George pointing at the back of the picture .Says so on the back !Good likeness said Fred grinning .Harry threw his new homework diary at him it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily If youve dotted the is and crossed the ts then you may do whatever you pleasel They got up and dressed they could hear various inhabitants of the house calling Merry Christmas to each other .On their way downstairs they met Hermione .Thanks for the book Harry !she said happily .Ive been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages !And that perfume is really unusual Ron .No problem said Ron .Whos that for anyway ?he added nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying .Kreacher said Hermione brightly .It had better not be clothes !said Ron warningly .You know what Sirius said Kreacher knows too much we cant set him free !It isnt clothes said Hermione although if I had my way Id certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag .No its a patchwork quilt I thought it would brighten up his bedroom .What bedroom ?said Harry dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Siriuss mother .Well Sirius says its not so much a bedroom more a kind of den said Hermione .Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen .Mrs Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there .She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold when she wished them Merry Christmas and they all averted their eyes .So this is Kreachers bedroom ?said Ron strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open .Yes said Hermione now sounding a little nervous .Er .I think wed better knock .Ron rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply .He must be sneaking around upstairs he said and without further ado pulled open the door .Urgh .Harry peered inside .Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and oldfashioned boiler but in the foots space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest .A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night .Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese .In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved magpielike from Siriuss purge of the house and he had also managed to retrieve the silverframed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer .Their glass might be shattered but still the little blackandwhite people inside them peered haughtily up at him including he felt a little jolt in his stomach the dark heavylidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledores Pensieve Bellatrix Lestrange .By the looks of it hers was Kreacher s favorite photograph he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape .I think Ill just leave his present here said Hermione laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly .Hell find it later thatll be fine .Come to think of it said Sirius emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately ?I havent seen him since the night we came back here said Harry .You were ordering him out of the kitchen .Yeah .said Sirius frowning .You know I think thats the last time I saw him too .He must be hiding upstairs somewhere .He couldnt have left could he ?said Harry .I mean when you said ‘out maybe he thought you meant get out of the house ?No no houseelves cant leave unless theyre given clothes theyre tied to their familys house said Sirius .They can leave the house if they really want to Harry contradicted him .Dobby did he left the Malfoys to give me warnings two years ago .He had to punish himself afterward but he still managed it .Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment then said Ill look for him later I expect Ill find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mothers old bloomers or something .Of course he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died .But I mustnt get my hopes up .Fred George and Ron laughed Hermione however looked reproachful .Once they had had their Christmas lunch the Weasleys and Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr Weasley another visit escorted by MadEye and Lupin .Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle having managed to borrow a car for the occasion as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day .The car which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of its owner had had a similar Enlarging Spell put upon it as the Weasleys old Ford Anglia although normally proportioned outside ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably .Mrs Weasley hesitated at the point of getting inside Harry knew that her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of traveling without magic finally the cold outside and her childrens pleading triumphed and she settled herself into the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace .The journey to St .Mungos was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads .A small trickle of witches and wizards were creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital .Harry and the others got out of the car and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them they strolled casually toward the window where the dummy in green nylon stood then one by one stepped through the glass .The reception area looked pleasantly festive The crystal orbs that illuminated St .Mungos had been turned to red and gold so that they became gigantic glowing Christmas baubles holly hung around every doorway and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner each topped with a gleaming gold star .It was less crowded than the last time they had been there although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril .Family argument eh ?smirked the blonde witch behind the desk .Youre the third Ive seen today .Spell Damage fourth floor .They found Mr Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face .Everything all right Arthur ?asked Mrs Weasley after they had all greeted Mr Weasley and handed over their presents .Fine fine said Mr Weasley a little too heartily .You er havent seen Healer Smethwyck have you ?No said Mrs Weasley suspiciously why ?Nothing nothing said Mr Weasley airily starting to unwrap his pile of gifts .Well everyone had a good day ?What did you all get for Christmas ?Oh Harry this is absolutely wonderful For he had just opened Harrys gift of fusewire and screwdrivers .Mrs Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr Weasleys answer .As her husband leaned over to shake Harrys hand she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt .Arthur she said with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap youve had your bandages changed .Why have you had your bandages changed a day early Arthur ?They told me they wouldnt need doing until tomorrow .What ?said Mr Weasley looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest .No no its nothing its I He seemed to deflate under Mrs Weasleys piercing gaze .Well now dont get upset Molly but Augustus Pye had an idea .Hes the Trainee Healer you know lovely young chap and very interested in .um .complementary medicine .I mean some of these old Muggle remedies .well theyre called stitches Molly and they work very well on on Muggle wounds Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl .Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him grinning .Do you mean to tell me said Mrs Weasley her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies ?Not messing about Molly dear said Mr Weasley imploringly .It was just just something Pye and I thought wed try only most unfortunately well with these particular kinds of wounds it doesnt seem to work as well as wed hoped Meaning ?Well .well I dont know whether you know what what stitches are ?It sounds as though youve been trying to sew your skin back together said Mrs Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter but even you Arthur wouldnt be that stupid I fancy a cup of tea too said Harry jumping to his feet .Hermione Ron and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him .As it swung closed behind them they heard Mrs Weasley shriek WHAT DO YOU MEAN THATS THE GENERAL IDEA ?Typical Dad said Ginny shaking her head as they set off up the corridor .Stitches .I ask you .Well you know they do work well on nonmagical wounds said Hermione fairly .I suppose something in that snakes venom dissolves them or something .I wonder where the tearoom is ?Fifth floor said Harry remembering the sign over the Welcome Witchs desk .They walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutallooking Healers .As they climbed it the various Healers called out to them diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies .Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit .And whats that supposed to be ?he asked angrily as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits shoving the occupants out of the way .Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin young master that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now Watch who youre calling gruesome !said Ron his ears turning red .The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad bind it tight about your throat stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels eyes I have not got spattergroit !But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage young master Theyre freckles !said Ron furiously .Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone !He rounded on the others who were all keeping determinedly straight faces .What floors this ?I think its the fifth said Hermione .Nah its the fourth said Harry one more But as he stepped onto the landing he came to an abrupt halt staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE .A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass .He had wavy blond hair bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth .Blimey !said Ron also staring at the man .Oh my goodness said Hermione suddenly sounding breathless .Professor Lockhart !Their exDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved toward them wearing a long lilac dressing gown .Well hello there !he said .I expect youd like my autograph would you ?Hasnt changed much has he ?Harry muttered to Ginny who grinned .Er how are you Professor ?said Ron sounding slightly guilty .It had been Rons malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockharts memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place though as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Rons memories at the time Harrys sympathy was limited .Im very well indeed thank you !said Lockhart exuberantly pulling a rather battered peacockfeather quill from his pocket .Now how many autographs would you like ?I can do joinedup writing now you know !Er we dont want any at the moment thanks said Ron raising his eyebrows at Harry who asked Professor should you be wandering around the corridors ?Shouldnt you be in a ward ?The smile faded slowly from Lockharts face .For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry then he said Havent we met ?Er .yeah we have said Harry .You used to teach us at Hogwarts remember ?Teach ?repeated Lockhart looking faintly unsettled .Me ?Did I ?And then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming .Taught you everything you know I expect did I ?Well how about those autographs then ?Shall we say a round dozen you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out !But just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice said Gilderoy you naughty boy where have you wandered off to ?A motherly looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor smiling warmly at Harry and the others .Oh Gilderoy youve got visitors !How lovely and on Christmas Day too !Do you know he never gets visitors poor lamb and I cant think why hes such a sweetie arent you ?Were doing autographs !Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile .They want loads of them wont take no for an answer !I just hope weve got enough photographs !Listen to him said the Healer taking Lockharts arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious twoyearold .He was rather well known a few years ago we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be coming back a little bit .Will you step this way ?Hes in a closed ward you know he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents the doors usually kept locked .not that hes dangerous !But she lowered her voice to a whisper bit of a danger to himself bless him .Doesnt know who he is you see wanders off and cant remember how to get back .It is nice of you to have come to see him Er said Ron gesturing uselessly at the floor above actually we were just er But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them and Rons feeble mutter of going to have a cup of tea trailed away into nothingness .They looked at one another rather hopelessly and then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor .Lets not stay long Ron said quietly .The Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey ward and muttered Alohomora .The door swung open and she led the way inside keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoys arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed .This is our longterm resident ward she informed Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny in a low voice .For permanent spell damage you know .Of course with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck we can produce some improvement .Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself and weve seen a real improvement in Mr Bode he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well though he isnt speaking any language we recognize yet .Well I must finish giving out the Christmas presents Ill leave you all to chat .Harry looked around this ward bore unmistakable signs of being a permanent home to its residents .They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr Weasleys ward the wall around Gilderoys headboard for instance was papered with pictures of himself all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals .He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed childish writing .The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs toward him seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly .You can put them in envelopes he said to Ginny throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them .I am not forgotten you know no I still receive a very great deal of fan mail .Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly .I just wish I knew why .He paused looking faintly puzzled then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigor .I suspect it is simply my good looks .A sallowskinned mournfullooking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him .Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year although fortunately the damage in her case had not been permanent .At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy .Here you are Agnes said the Healer brightly to the furryfaced woman handing her a small pile of Christmas presents .See not forgotten are you ?And your sons sent an owl to say hes visiting tonight so thats nice isnt it ?Agnes gave several loud barks .And look Broderick youve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month theyll brighten things up wont they ?said the Healer bustling along to the mumbling man setting a rather ugly plant with long swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand .And oh Mrs Longbottom are you leaving already ?Harrys head spun round .The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds a formidablelooking old witch wearing a long green dress a motheaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakably a stuffed vulture and trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed Neville .With a sudden rush of understanding Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be .He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned but Ron had looked up at the sound of the name Longbottom too and before Harry could stop him had called Neville Neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him .Its us Neville !said Ron brightly getting to his feet .Have you seen ?Lockharts here !Whove you been visiting ?Friends of yours Neville dear ?said Nevilles grandmother graciously bearing down upon them all .Neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here .A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them .Ah yes said his grandmother looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shriveled clawlike hand for him to shake .Yes yes I know who you are of course .Neville speaks most highly of you .Er thanks said Harry shaking hands .Neville did not look at him but stared at his own feet the color deepening in his face all the while .And you two are clearly Weasleys Mrs Longbottom continued proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn .Yes I know your parents not well of course but fine people fine people .and you must be Hermione Granger ?Hermione looked rather startled that Mrs Longbottom knew her name but shook hands all the same .Yes Nevilles told me all about you .Helped him out of a few sticky spots havent you ?Hes a good boy she said casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville but he hasnt got his fathers talent Im afraid to say .And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly .What ?said Ron looking amazed Harry wanted to stamp on Rons foot but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes .Is that your dad down the end Neville ?Whats this ?said Mrs Longbottom sharply .Havent you told your friends about your parents Neville ?Neville took a deep breath looked up at the ceiling and shook his head .Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation .Well its nothing to be ashamed of !said Mrs Longbottom angrily .You should be proud Neville proud .They didnt give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them you know !Im not ashamed said Neville very faintly still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others .Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds .Well youve got a funny way of showing it !said Mrs Longbottom .My son and his wife she said turning haughtily to Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny were tortured into insanity by YouKnow Whos followers .Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths .Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Nevilles parents and looked mortified .They were Aurors you know and very well respected within the Wizarding community Mrs Longbottom went on .Highly gifted the pair of them .I yes Alice dear what is it ?Nevilles mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress .She no longer had the plump happy looking face Harry had seen in Moodys old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix .Her face was thin and worn now her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair which had turned white was wispy and deadlooking .She did not seem to want to speak or perhaps she was not able to but she made timid motions toward Neville holding something in her outstretched hand .Again ?said Mrs Longbottom sounding slightly weary .Very well Alice dear very well Neville take it whatever it is .But Neville had already stretched out his hand into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper .Very nice dear said Nevilles grandmother in a falsely cheery voice patting his mother on the shoulder .But Neville said quietly Thanks Mum .His mother tottered away back up the ward humming to herself .Neville looked around at the others his expression defiant as though daring them to laugh but Harry did not think hed ever found anything less funny in his life .Well wed better get back sighed Mrs Longbottom drawing on long green gloves .Very nice to have met you all .Neville put that wrapper in the bin she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now .But as they left Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into his pocket .The door closed behind them .I never knew said Hermione who looked tearful .Nor did I said Ron rather hoarsely .Nor me whispered Ginny .They all looked at Harry .I did he said glumly .Dumbledore told me but I promised I wouldnt mention it .thats what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for using the Cruciatus Curse on Nevilles parents until they lost their minds .Bellatrix Lestrange did that ?whispered Hermione horrified .That woman Kreachers got a photo of in his den ?There was a long silence broken by Lockharts angry voice .Look I didnt learn joinedup writing for nothing you know !OCCLUMENCY Kreacher it transpired had been lurking in the attic .Sirius said he had found him up there covered in dust no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard .Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story it made Harry uneasy .Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual though once or twice Harry caught the houseelf staring avidly at him always looking quickly away when he saw that Harry had noticed .Harry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over .As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer he became more and more prone to what Mrs Weasley called fits of the sullens in which he would become taciturn and grumpy often withdrawing to Buckbeaks room for hours at a time .His gloom seeped through the house oozing under doorways like some noxious gas so that all of them became infected by it .Harry did not want to leave Sirius all alone again with only Kreacher for company .In fact for the first time in his life he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts .Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence .Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer Dumbledore remained as remote as ever in fact if it had not been for the D .A .Harry felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged him to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place .Then on the very last day of the holidays something happened that made Harry positively dread his return to school .Harry dear said Mrs Weasley poking her head into his and Rons bedroom where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione Ginny and Crookshanks could you come down to the kitchen ?Professor Snape would like a word with you .Harry did not immediately register what she had said one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Rons and he was egging it on enthusiastically .Squash him squash him hes only a pawn you idiot sorry Mrs Weasley what did you say ?Professor Snape dear .In the kitchen .Hed like a word .Harrys mouth fell open in horror .He looked around at Ron Hermione and Ginny all of whom were gaping back at him .Crookshanks whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour leapt gleefully upon the board and set the pieces running for cover squealing at the top of their voices .Snape ?said Harry blankly .Professor Snape dear said Mrs Weasley reprovingly .Now come on quickly he says he cant stay long .Whats he want with you ?said Ron looking unnerved as Mrs Weasley withdrew from the room .You havent done anything have you ?No !said Harry indignantly racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place .Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T ?He pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table glaring in opposite directions .The silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike .A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius .Er said Harry to announce his presence .Snape looked around at him his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair .Sit down Potter .You know said Sirius loudly leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling I think Id prefer it if you didnt give orders here Snape .Its my house you see .An ugly flush suffused Snape s pallid face .Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius facing Snape across the table .I was supposed to see you alone Potter said Snape the familiar sneer curling his mouth but Black Im his godfather said Sirius louder than ever .I am here on Dumbledores orders said Snape whose voice by contrast was becoming more and more quietly waspish but by all means stay Black I know you like to feel .involved .Whats that supposed to mean ?said Sirius letting his chair fall back onto all four legs with a loud bang .Merely that I am sure you must feel ah frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful Snape laid a delicate stress on the word for the Order .It was Siriuss turn to flush .Snape s lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry .The headmaster has sent me to tell you Potter that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term .Study what ?said Harry blankly .Snapes sneer became more pronounced .Occlumency Potter .The magical defense of the mind against external penetration .An obscure branch of magic but a highly useful one .Harrys heart began to pump very fast indeed .Defense against external penetration ?But he was not being possessed they had all agreed on that .Why do I have to study Occlu thing ?he blurted out .Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea said Snape smoothly .You will receive private lessons once a week but you will not tell anybody what you are doing least of all Dolores Umbridge .You understand ?Yes said Harry .Whos going to be teaching me ?Snape raised an eyebrow .I am he said .Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting .Extra lessons with Snape what on earth had he done to deserve this ?He looked quickly around at Sirius for support .Why cant Dumbledore teach Harry ?asked Sirius aggressively .Why you ?I suppose because it is a headmasters privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks said Snape silkily .I assure you I did not beg for the job .He got to his feet .I will expect you at six oclock on Monday evening Potter .My office .If anybody asks you are taking Remedial Potions .Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them .He turned to leave his black traveling cloak billowing behind him .Wait a moment said Sirius sitting up straighter in his chair .Snape turned back to face them sneering .I am in rather a hurry Black .unlike you I do not have unlimited leisure time .Ill get to the point then said Sirius standing up .He was rather taller than Snape who Harry noticed had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand .If I hear youre using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time youll have me to answer to .How touching Snape sneered .But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father ?Yes I have said Sirius proudly .Well then youll know hes so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him Snape said sleekly .Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward Snape pulling out his wand as he went Snape whipped out his own .They were squaring up to each other Sirius looking livid Snape calculating his eyes darting from Siriuss wand tip to his face .Sirius !said Harry loudly but Sirius appeared not to hear him .Ive warned you Snivellus said Sirius his face barely a foot from Snape s I dont care if Dumbledore thinks youve reformed I know better Oh but why dont you tell him so ?whispered Snape .Or are you afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mothers house for six months very seriously ?Tell me how is Lucius Malfoy these days ?I expect hes delighted his lapdogs working at Hogwarts isnt he ?Speaking of dogs said Snape softly did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside ?Clever idea Black getting yourself seen on a safe station platform .gave you a castiron excuse not to leave your hidey hole in future didnt it ?Sirius raised his wand .NO !Harry yelled vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them Sirius dont Are you calling me a coward ?roared Sirius trying to push Harry out of the way but Harry would not budge .Why yes I suppose I am said Snape .Harry get out of it !snarled Sirius pushing him out of the way with his free hand .The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family plus Hermione came inside all looking very happy with Mr Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas covered by a mackintosh .Cured !he announced brightly to the kitchen at large .Completely cured !He and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold gazing at the scene in front of them which was also suspended in midaction both Sirius and Snape looking toward the door with their wands pointing into each others faces and Harry immobile between them a hand stretched out to each of them trying to force them apart .Merlins beard said Mr Weasley the smile sliding off his face whats going on here ?Both Sirius and Snape lowered their wands .Harry looked from one to the other .Each wore an expression of utmost contempt yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses .Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across the kitchen passing the Weasleys without comment .At the door he looked back .Six oclock Monday evening Potter .He was gone .Sirius glared after him his wand at his side .But whats been going on ?asked Mr Weasley again .Nothing Arthur said Sirius who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance .Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends .With what looked like an enormous effort he smiled .So .youre cured ?Thats great news really great .Yes isnt it ?said Mrs Weasley leading her husband forward into a chair .Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end found an antidote to whatever that snakes got in its fangs and Arthurs learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine havent you dear ?she added rather menacingly .Yes Molly dear said Mr Weasley meekly .That nights meal should have been a cheerful one with Mr Weasley back amongst them Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and Georges jokes or offering everyone more food his face fell back into a moody brooding expression .Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and MadEye who had dropped in to offer Mr Weasley their congratulations he wanted to talk to Sirius to tell him that he should not listen to a word Snape said that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place but he had no opportunity to do so and wondered occasionally eyeing the ugly look on Siriuss face whether he would have dared to even if he had the chance .Instead he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape .Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort said Hermione at once .Well you wont be sorry not to have them anymore will you ?Extra lessons with Snape ?said Ron sounding aghast .Id rather have the nightmares !They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry Ron and Hermione arrived there next morning .The adults seemed to have been midway through a whispered conversation when the door opened all of them looked around hastily and fell silent .After a hurried breakfast they pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly gray January morning .Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest he did not want to say goodbye to Sirius .He had a bad feeling about this parting he did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid Harry was worried that Snapes accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place .Before he could think of what to say however Sirius had beckoned him to his side .I want you to take this he said quietly thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harrys hands .What is it ?Harry asked .A way of letting me know if Snapes giving you a hard time .No dont open it in here !said Sirius with a wary look at Mrs Weasley who was trying to persuade the twins to wear handknitted mittens .I doubt Molly would approve but I want you to use it if you need me all right ?Okay said Harry stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket but he knew he would never use whatever it was .It would not be he Harry who lured Sirius from his place of safety no matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlumency classes .Lets go then said Sirius clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly and before Harry could say anything else they were heading upstairs stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door surrounded by Weasleys .Goodbye Harry take care said Mrs Weasley hugging him .See you Harry and keep an eye out for snakes for me !said Mr Weasley genially shaking his hand .Right yeah said Harry distractedly .It was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful he turned looked into his godfathers face and opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief onearmed hug .He said gruffly Look after yourself Harry and next moment Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air with Tonks today heavily disguised as a tall tweedy woman with irongray hair chivvying him down the steps .The door of number twelve slammed shut behind them .They followed Lupin down the front steps .As he reached the pavement Harry looked around .Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways squeezing it out of sight one blink later it had gone .Come on the quicker we get on the bus the better said Tonks and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square .Lupin flung out his right arm .BANG .A violently purple tripledecker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost which jumped backward out of its way .A thin pimply jugeared youth in a purple uniform leapt down onto the pavement and said Welcome to the Yes yes we know thank you said Tonks swiftly .On on get on And she shoved Harry forward toward the steps past the conductor who goggled at Harry as he passed .Ere its Arry !If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion muttered Tonks menacingly now shunting Ginny and Hermione forward .Ive always wanted to go on this thing said Ron happily joining Harry on board and looking around .It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads .Now in the early morning it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows .Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet grumbling and somebodys shopping bag had slid the length of the bus an unpleasant mixture of frog spawn cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor .Looks like well have to split up said Tonics briskly looking around for empty chairs .Fred George and Ginny if you just take those seats at the back .Remus can stay with you .She Harry Ron and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck where there were two chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back .Stan Shunpike the conductor followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back .Heads turned as Harry passed and when he sat down he saw all the faces flick back to the front again .As Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each the bus set off again swaying ominously .It rumbled around Grimmauld Square weaving on and off the pavement then with another tremendous BANG they were all flung backward Rons chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon who had been on his lap burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon Hermiones shoulder instead .Harry who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket looked out of the window they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway .Just outside Birmingham said Stan happily answering Harrys unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor .You keepin well then Arry ?I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer but it werent never nuffink very nice .I said to Ern I said ‘e didnt seem like a nutter when we met im just goes to show dunnit ?He handed over their tickets and continued to gaze enthralled at Harry apparently Stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they were famous enough to be in the paper .The Knight Bus swayed alarmingly overtaking a line of cars on the inside .Looking toward the front of the bus Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder .BANG .Chairs slid backward again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends .Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges .From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills then to a windswept road between highrise flats each time with a loud BANG .Ive changed my mind muttered Ron picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time I never want to ride on here again .Listen its Ogwarts stop after this said Stan brightly swaying toward them .That bossy woman up front oo got on with you shes given us a little tip to move you up the queue .Were just gonna let Madam Marsh off first though There was more retching from downstairs followed by a horrible spattering sound .Shes not feeling er best .A few minutes later the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision .They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck .The bus moved on again gathering speed until BANG .They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade .Harry caught a glimpse of the Hogs Head down its side street the severed boars head sign creaking in the wintry wind .Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus .At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts .Lupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage and then got off to say goodbye .Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them noses flat against the windows .Youll be safe once youre in the grounds said Tonks casting a careful eye around at the deserted road .Have a good term okay ?Look after yourselves said Lupin shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last .And listen .He lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged lastminute goodbyes with Tonks Harry I know you dont like Snape but he is a superb Occlumens and we all Sirius included want you to learn to protect yourself so work hard all right ?Yeah all right said Harry heavily looking up into Lupins prematurely lined face .See you then .The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunks .Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime .Harry glanced back when they reached the oak front doors the Knight Bus had already gone and he halfwished given what was coming the following day that he was still on board .Harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening .His morning Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation as Snape was as unpleasant as ever and Harrys mood was further lowered by the fact that members of the D .A .were continually approaching him in the corridors between classes asking hopefully whether there would be a meeting that night .Ill let you know when the next one is Harry said over and over again but I cant do it tonight Ive got to go to er Remedial Potions .You take Remedial Potions ?asked Zacharias Smith superciliously having cornered Harry in the entrance hall after lunch .Good Lord you must be terrible Snape doesnt usually give extra lessons does he ?As Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion Ron glared after him .Shall I jinx him ?I can still get him from here he said raising his wand and taking aim between Smiths shoulder blades .Forget it said Harry dismally .Its what everyones going to think isnt it ?That Im really stup Hi Harry said a voice behind him .He turned around and found Cho standing there .Oh said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably .Hi .Well be in the library Harry said Hermione firmly and she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase .Had a good Christmas ?asked Cho .Yeah not bad said Harry .Mine was pretty quiet said Cho .For some reason she was looking rather embarrassed .Erm .theres another Hogsmeade trip next month did you see the notice ?What ?Oh no I havent checked the notice board since I got back .Yes its on Valentines Day .Right said Harry wondering why she was telling him this .Well I suppose you want to ?Only if you do she said eagerly .Harry stared .He had been about to say I suppose you want to know when the next D .A .meeting is ?but her response did not seem to fit .I er he said .Oh its okay if you dont she said looking mortified .Dont worry .IIll see you around .She walked away .Harry stood staring after her his brain working frantically .Then something clunked into place .Cho !Hey CHO !He ran after her catching her halfway up the marble staircase .Er dyou want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentines Day ?Oooh yes !she said blushing crimson and beaming at him .Right .well .thats settled then said Harry and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all he headed off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons walking in a rather bouncy way himself .By six oclock that evening however even the glow of having successfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward Snapes office .He paused outside the door when he reached it wishing he were almost anywhere else then taking a deep breath knocked and entered .It was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants suspended in variously colored potions .In a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry not without reason of robbing .Harrys attention was drawn toward the desk however where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight .Harry recognized it at once Dumbledores Pensieve .Wondering what on earth it was doing here he jumped when Snapes cold voice came out of the corner .Shut the door behind you Potter .Harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself as he did so .When he turned back to face the room Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk .Harry sat down and so did Snape his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry dislike etched in every line of his face .Well Potter you know why you are here he said .The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency .I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions .Right said Harry tersely .This may not be an ordinary class Potter said Snape his eyes narrowed malevolently but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘sir or ‘Professor at all times .Yes .sir said Harry .Now Occlumency .As I told you back in your dear godfathers kitchen this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence .And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it sir ?said Harry looking directly into Snapes dark cold eyes and wondering whether he would answer .Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously Surely even you could have worked that out by now Potter ?The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency Whats that ?Sir ?It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another persons mind He can read minds ?said Harry quickly his worst fears confirmed .You have no subtlety Potter said Snape his dark eyes glittering .You do not understand fine distinctions .It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potionmaker .Snape paused for a moment apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting Harry before continuing Only Muggles talk of ‘mind reading .The mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure .Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls to be perused by any invader .The mind is a complex and manylayered thing Potter .or at least most minds are .He smirked .It is true however that those who have mastered Legilimency are able under certain conditions to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly .The Dark Lord for instance almost always knows when somebody is lying to him .Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection .Whatever Snape said Legilimency sounded like mind reading to Harry and he did not like the sound of it at all .So he could know what were thinking right now ?Sir ?The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them said Snape .Time and space matter in magic Potter .Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency .Well then why do I have to learn Occlumency ?Snape eyed Harry tracing his mouth with one long thin finger as he did so .The usual rules do not seem to apply with you Potter .The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord .The evidence suggests that at times when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable when you are asleep for instance you are sharing the Dark Lords thoughts and emotions .The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue .He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord .Harrys heart was pumping fast again .None of this added up .But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it ?he asked abruptly .I dont like it much but its been useful hasnt it ?I mean .I saw that snake attack Mr Weasley and if I hadnt Professor Dumbledore wouldnt have been able to save him would he ?Sir ?Snape stared at Harry for a few moments still tracing his mouth with his finger .When he spoke again it was slowly and deliberately as though he weighed every word .It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently .Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser .However the vision you had shortly before Christmas The one with the snake and Mr Weasley ?Do not interrupt me Potter said Snape in a dangerous voice .As I was saying .the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lords thoughts I saw inside the snakes head not his !I thought I just told you not to interrupt me Potter ?But Harry did not care if Snape was angry at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business .He had moved forward in his chair so that without realizing it he was perched on the very edge tense as though poised for flight .How come I saw through the snakes eyes if its Voldemorts thoughts Im sharing ?Do not say the Dark Lords name spat Snape .There was a nasty silence .They glared at each other across the Pensieve .Professor Dumbledore says his name said Harry quietly .Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard Snape muttered .While he may feel secure enough to use the name .the rest of us .He rubbed his left forearm apparently unconsciously on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin .I just wanted to know Harry began again forcing his voice back to politeness why You seem to have visited the snakes mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment snarled Snape .He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too .And Vol he realized I was there ?It seems so said Snape coolly .How do you know ?said Harry urgently .Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing or ?I told you said Snape rigid in his chair his eyes slits to call me ‘sir .Yes sir said Harry impatiently but how do you know ?It is enough that we know said Snape repressively .The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings .He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse that is to say he has realized that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return And he might try and make me do things ?asked Harry .Sir ?he added hurriedly .He might said Snape sounding cold and unconcerned .Which brings us back to Occlumency .Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and Harry tensed in his chair but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair .When he withdrew it some silvery substance came away stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve where it swirled silvery white neither gas nor liquid .Twice more Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin then without offering any explanation of his behavior he picked up the Pensieve carefully removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready .Stand up and take out your wand Potter .Harry got to his feet feeling nervous .They faced each other with the desk between them .You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me or defend yourself in any other way you can think of said Snape .And what are you going to do ?Harry asked eyeing Snape s wand apprehensively .I am about to attempt to break into your mind said Snape softly .We are going to see how well you resist .I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse .You will find that similar powers are needed for this .Brace yourself now .LegilimensV Snape had struck before Harry was ready before Harry had even begun to summon any force of resistance the office swam in front of his eyes and vanished image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings .He was five watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle and his heart was bursting with jealousy .He was nine and Ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing below on the lawn .He was sitting under the Sorting Hat and it was telling him he would do well in Slytherin .Hermione was lying in the hospital wing her face covered with thick black hair .A hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake .Cho Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe .No said a voice in Harrys head as the memory of Cho drew nearer youre not watching that youre not watching it its private He felt a sharp pain in his knee .Snape s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape s desk .He looked up at Snape who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist .There was an angry weal there like a scorch mark .Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex ?asked Snape coolly .No said Harry bitterly getting up from the floor .I thought not said Snape contemptuously .You let me get in too far .You lost control .Did you see everything I saw ?Harry asked unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer .Flashes of it said Snape his lip curling .To whom did the dog belong ?My Aunt Marge Harry muttered hating Snape .Well for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been said Snape raising his wand once more .You managed to stop me eventually though you wasted time and energy shouting .You must remain focused .Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand .Im trying said Harry angrily but youre not telling me how !Manners Potter said Snape dangerously .Now I want you to close your eyes .Harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told .He did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced him carrying a wand .Clear your mind Potter said Snape s cold voice .Let go of all emotion .But Harrys anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom .Let go of his anger ?He could as easily detach his legs .Youre not doing it Potter .You will need more discipline than this .Focus now .Harry tried to empty his mind tried not to think or remember or feel .Lets go again .on the count of three .one two three Legilimensl A great black dragon was rearing in front of him .His father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror .Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him .NOOOOOOO !He was on his knees again his face buried in his hands his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull .Get up !said Snape sharply .Get up !You are not trying you are making no effort you are allowing me access to memories you fear handing me weapons !Harry stood up again his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard .Snape looked paler than usual and angrier though not nearly as angry as Harry was .I am making an effort he said through clenched teeth .I told you to empty yourself of emotion !Yeah ?Well Im finding that hard at the moment Harry snarled .Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord !said Snape savagely .Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves who cannot control their emotions who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily weak people in other words they stand no chance against his powers !He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease Potter !I am not weak said Harry in a low voice fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment .Then prove it !Master yourself !spat Snape .Control your anger discipline your mind !We shall try again !Get ready now !Legilimens He was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letter box shut .A hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds toward him .He was running along a windowless passage with Mr Weasley .They were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor .Harry expected to go through it .but Mr Weasley led him off to the left down a flight of stone steps .I KNOW !I KNOW !He was on all fours again on Snapes office floor his scar was prickling unpleasantly but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant .He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at him his wand raised .It looked as though this time Snape had lifted the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back .What happened then Potter ?he asked eyeing Harry intently .I saw I remembered Harry panted .Ive just realized .Realized what ?asked Snape sharply .Harry did not answer at once he was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as he rubbed his forehead .He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months without once realizing that it was a real place .Now seeing the memory again he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry .It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries and Mr Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemorts snake .He looked up at Snape .Whats in the Department of Mysteries ?What did you say ?Snape asked quietly and Harry saw with deep satisfaction that Snape was unnerved .I said whats in the Department of Mysteries sir ?Harry said .And why said Snape slowly would you ask such a thing ?Because said Harry watching Snape closely for a reaction that corridor Ive just seen Ive been dreaming about it for months Ive just recognized it it leads to the Department of Mysteries .and I think Voldemort wants something from I have told you not to say the Dark Lords name They glared at each other .Harrys scar seared again but he did not care .Snape looked agitated .When he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned .There are many things in the Department of Mysteries Potter few of which you would understand and none of which concern you do I make myself plain ?Yes Harry said still rubbing his prickling scar which was becoming more painful .I want you back here same time on Wednesday and we will continue work then .Fine said Harry .He was desperate to get out of Snape s office and find Ron and Hermione .You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep empty it make it blank and calm you understand ?Yes said Harry who was barely listening .And be warned Potter .I shall know if you have not practiced .Right Harry mumbled .He picked up his schoolbag swung it over his shoulder and hurried toward the office door .As he opened it he glanced back at Snape who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head .Harry left without another word closing the door carefully behind him his scar still throbbing painfully .Harry found Ron and Hermione in the library where they were working on Umbridges most recent ream of homework .Other students nearly all of them fifth years sat at lamplit tables nearby noses close to books quills scratching feverishly while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker .The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pinces shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books .Harry felt shivery his scar was still aching he felt almost feverish .When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite .He was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual .How did it go ?Hermione whispered and then looking concerned Are you all right Harry ?Yeah .fine .I dunno said Harry impatiently wincing as pain shot through his scar again .Listen .Ive just realized something .And he told them what he had just seen and deduced .So .so are you saying .whispered Ron as Madam Pince swept past squeaking slightly that the weapon the thing YouKnow Whos after is in the Ministry of Magic ?In the Department of Mysteries its got to be Harry whispered .I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and its definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him .Hermione let out a long slow sigh .Of course she breathed .Of course what ?said Ron rather impatiently .Ron think about it .Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic .It must have been that one its too much of a coincidence !How come Sturgis was trying to break in when hes on our side ?said Ron .Well I dont know Hermione admitted .That is a bit odd .So whats in the Department of Mysteries ?Harry asked Ron .Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it ?I know they call the people who work in there ‘Unspeakables said Ron frowning .Because no one really seems to know what they do in there .Weird place to have a weapon .Its not weird at all it makes perfect sense said Hermione .It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing I expect .Harry are you sure youre all right ?For Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it .Yeah .fine .he said lowering his hands which were trembling .I just feel a bit .I dont like Occlumency much .I expect anyone would feel shaky if theyd had their mind attacked over and over again said Hermione sympathetically .Look lets get back to the common room well be a bit more comfortable there .But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise .Headless Hats !shouted George as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students .Two Galleons each watch Fred now !Fred swept the hat onto his head beaming .For a second he merely looked rather stupid then both hat and head vanished .Several girls screamed but everyone else was roaring with laughter .And off again !shouted George and Freds hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder then his head reappeared as he swept the pinkfeathered hat from it again .How do those hats work then ?said Hermione distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George .I mean obviously its some kind of Invisibility Spell but its rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object .Id imagine the charm wouldnt have a very long life though .Harry did not answer he was still feeling ill .Im going to have to do this tomorrow he muttered pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it .Well write it in your homework planner then !said Hermione encouragingly .So you dont forget !Harry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively .Dont leave it till later you big secondrateri chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridges homework .Hermione beamed at it .I think 111 go to bed said Harry stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got .He walked across the common room dodging George who tried to put a Headless Hat on him and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys dormitories .He was feeling sick again just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right .He opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head .He did not know where he was whether he was standing or lying down he did not even know his own name .Maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears .He was happier than he had been in a very long time .Jubilant ecstatic triumphant .A wonderful wonderful thing had happened .Harry ?HARRY !Someone had hit him around the face .The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain .The happiness was draining out of him but the laughter continued .He opened his eyes and as he did so he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth .The moment he realized this it died away Harry lay panting on the floor staring up at the ceiling the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly .Ron was bending over him looking very worried .What happened ?he said .I .dunno .Harry gasped sitting up again .Hes really happy .really happy .YouKnowWho is ?Something goods happened mumbled Harry .He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr Weasley and felt very sick .Something hes been hoping for .The words came just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room as though a stranger was speaking them through Harrys mouth yet he knew they were true .He took deep breaths willing himself not to vomit all over Ron .He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time .Hermione told me to come and check on you said Ron in a low voice helping Harry to his feet .She says your defenses will be low at the moment after Snapes been fiddling around with your mind .Still I suppose itll help in the long run wont it ?He looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him toward bed .Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening his scar still prickling painfully .He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his minds resistance rather than strengthening it and he wondered with a feeling of great trepidation what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years .THE BEETLE AT BAY Harrys question was answered the very next morning .When Hermiones Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out gazed for a moment at the front page and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her .What ?said Harry and Ron together .For an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten blackandwhite photographs that filled the whole of the front page nine showing wizards faces and the tenth a witchs .Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures looking insolent .Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban .Antonin Dolohov read the legend beneath a wizard with a long pale twisted face who was sneering up at Harry convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett .Augustus Rookwood said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture looking bored convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He WhoMustNotBeNamed .But Harrys eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch .Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page .She had long dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture though he had seen it sleek thick and shining .She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes an arrogant disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth .Like Sirius she retained vestiges of great good looks but something perhaps Azkaban had taken most of her beauty .Bellatrix Lestrange convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom .Hermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures which Harry concentrating on Bellatrix had not yet read .MASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS RALLYING POINT FOR OLD DEATH EATERS Black ?said Harry loudly .Not ?Shhh whispered Hermione desperately .Not so loud just read it !The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban .Speaking to reporters in his private office Cornelius Fudge Minister of Magic confirmed that ten high security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals .We find ourselves most unfortunately in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped said Fudge last night .Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated .An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help and we must remember that Black as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps .We think it likely that these individuals who include Blacks cousin Bellatrix Lestrange have rallied around Black as their leader .We are however doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious .On no account should any of these individuals be approached .There you are Harry said Ron looking awestruck .Thats why he was happy last night .I dont believe this snarled Harry Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius ?What other options does he have ?said Hermione bitterly .He can hardly say ‘Sorry everyone Dumbledore warned me this might happen the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort stop whimpering Ron ‘and now Voldemorts worst supporters have broken out too .I mean hes spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars hasnt he ?Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall .He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione .There they all were talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemorts ranks .He glanced up at the staff table .It was a different story here Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation both looking extremely grave .Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon .Meanwhile at the far end of the table Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge .For once her pouchy toads eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students .She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently .Oh my said Hermione wonderingly still staring at the newspaper .What now ?said Harry quickly he was feeling jumpy .Its .horrible said Hermione looking shaken .She folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to Harry and Ron .TRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER St .Mungos Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode 49 was discovered dead in his bed strangled by a pottedplant .Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr Bode who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death .Healer Miriam Strout who was in charge of Mr Bodes ward at the time of the incident has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement St .Mungos deeply regrets the death of Mr Bode whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident .We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout busy over the Christmas period overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr Bodes bedside table .As his speech and mobility improved Healer Strout encouraged Mr Bode to look after the plant himself unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom but a cutting of Devils Snare which when touched by the convalescent Mr Bode throttled him instantly .St .Mungos is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward .Bode .said Ron .Bode .It rings a bell .We saw him Hermione whispered .In St .Mungos remember ?He was in the bed opposite Lockharts just lying there staring at the ceiling .And we saw the Devils Snare arrive .She the Healer said it was a Christmas present .Harry looked back at the story .A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat .How come we didnt recognize Devils Snare . ?Weve seen it before .we couldve stopped this from happening .Who expects Devils Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant ?said Ron sharply .Its not our fault whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame !They must be a real prat why didnt they check what they were buying ?Oh come on Ron !said Hermione shakily I dont think anyone could put Devils Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it ?This this was murder .A clever murder as well .If the plant was sent anonymously hows anyone ever going to find out who did it ?Harry was not thinking about Devils Snare .He was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing and the sallowfaced man who had got in on the Atrium level .I met Bode he said slowly .I saw him at the Ministry with your dad .Rons mouth fell open .Ive heard Dad talk about him at home !He was an Unspeakable he worked in the Department of Mysteries !They looked at one another for a moment then Hermione pulled the newspaper back toward her closed it glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front then leapt to her feet .Where are you going ?said Ron startled .To send a letter said Hermione swinging her bag onto her shoulder .It .well I dont know whether .but its worth trying .and Im the only one who can I hate it when she does that grumbled Ron as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own slower way out of the Great Hall .Would it kill her to tell us what shes up to for once ?Itd take her about ten more seconds hey Hagrid !Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass .He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose .All righ you two ?he said trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace .Are you okay Hagrid ?asked Harry following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws .Fine fine said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightenedlooking Professor Vector who was passing .Jus busy yeh know usual stuff lessons ter prepare couple o salamanders got scale rot an Im on probation he mumbled .Youre on probation ?said Ron very loudly so that many students passing looked around curiously .Sorry I mean youre on probation ?he whispered .Yeah said Hagrid .Sno moren I expected ter tell yeh the truth .Yeh migh notve picked up on it bu that inspection didn go too well yeh know .anyway he sighed deeply .Bes go an mb a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tailsll be hangin off em next .See yeh Harry .Ron .He trudged away out the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds .Harry watched him go wondering how much more bad news he could stand .The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days but to Harrys indignation hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it indeed some people Draco Malfoy prominent among them seemed positively gleeful .As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St .Mungos Harry Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared .There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now the ten escaped Death Eaters whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers .Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts just as Sirius Black had done .Those who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemorts reign of terror were legendary .There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors Susan Bones who had an uncle aunt and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry .And I dont know how you stand it its horrible she said bluntly dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort .It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers voices .They sounded curious rather than hostile now and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophets version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress .In their confusion and fear these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year .It was not only the students mood that had changed .It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low urgent whispers in the corridors breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching .They obviously cant talk freely in the staffroom anymore said Hermione in a low voice as she Harry and Ron passed Professors McGonagall Flitwick and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day .Not with Umbridge there .Reckon they know anything new ?said Ron gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers .If they do were not going to hear about it are we ?said Harry angrily .Not after Decree .What number are we on now ?For new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS Teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach .The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twentysix .Signed Dolores Jane Umbridge HIGH INQUISITOR This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students .Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class .Exploding Snaps got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor !Thats not information relating to your subject !When Harry next saw Lee the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly .Harry recommended essence of murtlap .Harry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved Fudges nose .It seemed however to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control .She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first .Every single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard .She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room interrupting Professor Trelawneys increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology insisting that she predict students answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn .Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain several times he passed her in the corridors in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room muttering wildly to herself wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry .If he had not been so worried about Hagrid he would have felt sorry for her but if one of them was to be ousted out of a job there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain .Unfortunately Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney .Though he seemed to be following Hermiones advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a crup a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail since before Christmas he also seemed to have lost his nerve .He was oddly distracted and jumpy in lessons losing the thread of what he was saying while talking to the class answering questions wrongly and glancing anxiously at Umbridge all the time .He was also more distant with Harry Ron and Hermione than he had ever been before expressly forbidding them to visit him after dark .If she catches yeh itll be all of our necks on the line he told them flatly and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings .It seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living visits to Hagrids house letters from Sirius his Firebolt and Quidditch .He took his revenge the only way he had redoubling his efforts for the D .A .Harry was pleased to see that all of them even Zacharias Smith had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville .The news of his parents attackers escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him .He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St .Mungos and taking their lead from him they had kept quiet about it too .Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers escape in fact he barely spoke during D .A .meetings anymore but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse Harry taught them his plump face screwed up in concentration apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents working harder than anyone else in the room .He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville .In fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D .A .meetings .Harrys sessions with Snape which had started badly enough were not improving on the contrary Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson .Before he had started studying Occlumency his scar had prickled occasionally usually during the night or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemorts thoughts or moods that he experienced every now and then .Nowadays however his scar hardly ever stopped prickling and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar .He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemorts mood and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape .What was more he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night dreams that always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door .Maybe its a bit like an illness said Hermione looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron .A fever or something .It has to get worse before it gets better .Its lessons with Snape that are making it worse said Harry flatly .Im getting sick of my scar hurting and Im getting bored walking down that corridor every night .He rubbed his forehead angrily .I just wish the door would open Im sick of standing staring at it Thats not funny said Hermione sharply .Dumbledore doesnt want you to have dreams about that corridor at all or he wouldnt have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency .Youre just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons .I am working !said Harry nettled .You try it sometime Snape trying to get inside your head its not a bundle of laughs you know !Maybe .said Ron slowly .Maybe what ?said Hermione rather snappishly .Maybe its not Harrys fault he cant close his mind said Ron darkly .What do you mean ?said Hermione .Well maybe Snape isnt really trying to help Harry .Harry and Hermione stared at him .Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other .Maybe he said again in a lower voice hes actually trying to open Harrys mind a bit wider .make it easier for YouKnow Shut up Ron said Hermione angrily .How many times have you suspected Snape and when have you ever been right ?Dumbledore trusts him he works for the Order that ought to be enough .He used to be a Death Eater said Ron stubbornly .And weve never seen proof that he really swapped sides .Dumbledore trusts him Hermione repeated .And if we cant trust Dumbledore we cant trust anyone .With so much to worry about and so much to do startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working until past midnight secret D .A .meetings and regular classes with Snape January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast .Before Harry knew it February had arrived bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year .Harry had had very little time to spare on conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together but suddenly found himself facing a Valentines Day spent entirely in her company .On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully .He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls .Hedwig was not there not that he had expected her but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down .And about time !If it hadnt come today .she said eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment .Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face .Listen Harry she said looking up at him .This is really important .Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday ?Well .I dunno said Harry dubiously .Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her .We never said what we were going to do .Well bring her along if you must said Hermione urgently .But will you come ?Well .all right but why ?I havent got time to tell you now Ive got to answer this quickly And she hurried out of the Great Hall the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other .Are you coming ?Harry asked Ron but he shook his head looking glum .I cant come into Hogsmeade at all Angelina wants a full days training .Like its going to help were the worst team Ive ever seen .You should see Sloper and Kirke theyre pathetic even worse than I am .He heaved a great sigh .I dunno why Angelina wont just let me resign .Its because youre good when youre on form thats why said Harry irritably .He found it very hard to be sympathetic to Rons plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff .Ron seemed to notice Harrys tone because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterward .Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet Cho feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about .She was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long ponytail .Harrys feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked toward her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they looked swinging at his sides .Hi said Cho slightly breathlessly .Hi said Harry .They stared at each other for a moment then Harry said Well er shall we go then ?Oh yes .They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch occasionally catching each others eye and grinning shiftily but not talking to each other .Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awkward .It was a fresh breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them .You really miss it dont you ?said Cho .He looked around and saw her watching him .Yeah sighed Harry .I do .Remember the first time we played against each other in the third year ?she asked him .Yeah said Harry grinning .You kept blocking me .And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to said Cho smiling reminiscently .I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree is that right ?Nah it was Puddlemere United I saw him at the World Cup last year .Oh I saw you there too remember ?We were on the same campsite .It was really good wasnt it ?The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates .Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her no more difficult in fact than talking to Ron and Hermione and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them including Pansy Parkinson .Potter and Chang !screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles .Urgh Chang I dont think much of your taste .At least Diggory was goodlooking !They sped up talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake .Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch and Cho slightly flushed was watching her feet .So .where dyou want to go ?Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade .The High Street was full of students ambling up and down peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements .Oh .I dont mind said Cho shrugging .Um .shall we just have a look in the shops or something ?They wandered toward Dervish and Banges .A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it .They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped Death Eaters .The poster By Order of the Ministry of Magic offered a thousandGalleon reward to any witch or wizard with information relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured .Its funny isnt it said Cho in a low voice also gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters .Remember when that Sirius Black escaped and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him ?And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there arent dementors anywhere .Yeah said Harry tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestranges face to glance up and down the High Street .Yeah it is weird .He was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby but now he came to think of it their absence was highly significant .They had not only let the Death Eaters escape they were not bothering to look for them .It looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now .The ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed .It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshafts cold heavy drops of water kept hitting Harrys face and the back of his neck .Um .dyou want to get a coffee ?said Cho tentatively as the rain began to fall more heavily .Yeah all right said Harry looking around .Where ?Oh theres a really nice place just up here havent you ever been to Madam Puddifoots ?she said brightly and she led him up a side road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before .It was a cramped steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows .Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridges office .Cute isnt it ?said Cho happily .Er .yeah said Harry untruthfully .Look shes decorated it for Valentines Day !said Cho indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small circular tables occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants .aah .They sat down at the last remaining table which was situated in the steamy window .Roger Davies the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl .They were holding hands .The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable particularly when looking around the tea shop he saw that it was full of nothing but couples all of them holding hands .Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand .What can I get you mdears ?said Madam Puddifoot a very stout woman with a shiny black bun squeezing between their table and Roger Daviess with great difficulty .Two coffees please said Cho .In the time it took for their coffees to arrive Roger Davies and his girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl .Harry wished they wouldnt he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete .He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window but it was so steamed up he could not see the street outside .To postpone the moment when he had to look at Cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub .After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D .A .meetings it did not last very long .Silence fell again .Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say .Er .listen dyou want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime ?Im meeting Hermione Granger there .Cho raised her eyebrows .Youre meeting Hermione Granger ?Today ?Yeah .Well she asked me to so I thought I would .Dyou want to come with me ?She said it wouldnt matter if you did .Oh .well .that was nice of her .But Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all on the contrary her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding .A few more minutes passed in total silence Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup .Next door Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips .Chos hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it .Just do it he told himself as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest .Just reach out and grab it .Amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair .But just as he moved his hand forward Cho took hers off the table .She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression .He asked me out you know she said in a quiet voice .A couple of weeks ago .Roger .I turned him down though .Harry who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table could not think why she was telling him this .If she wished she were sitting at the table next door being heartily kissed by Roger Davies why had she agreed to come out with him ?He said nothing .Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink .I came in here with Cedric last year said Cho .In the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said Harrys insides had become glacial .He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads .Chos voice was rather higher when she spoke again .Ive been meaning to ask you for ages .Did Cedric did he mmmention me at all before he died ?This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss and least of all with Cho .Well no he said quietly .There there wasnt time for him to say anything .Erm .so .dyou .dyou get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays ?You support the Tornados right ?His voice sounded falsely bright and cheery .To his horror he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again just as they had been after the last D .A .meeting before Christmas .Look he said desperately leaning in so that nobody else could overhear lets not talk about Cedric right now .Lets talk about something else .But this apparently was quite the wrong thing to say .I thought she said tears spattering down onto the table .I thought youd uuunderstand !I need to talk about it !Surely you nneed to talk about it ttoo !I mean you saw it happen ddidnt you ?Everything was going nightmarishly wrong Roger Davies girlfriend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying .Well I have talked about it Harry said in a whisper to Ron and Hermione but Oh youll talk to Hermione Granger !she said shrilly her face now shining with tears and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare .But you wont talk to me !Pperhaps it would be best if we just .just ppaid and you went and met up with Hermione GGranger like you obviously want to !Harry stared at her utterly bewildered as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it .Cho ?he said weakly wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho .Go on leave !she said now crying into the napkin .I dont know why you asked me out in the first place if youre going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me .How many are you meeting after Hermione ?Its not like that !said Harry and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed which he realized a split second too late was a mistake .Cho sprang to her feet .The whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now .Ill see you around Harry she said dramatically and hiccuping slightly she dashed to the door wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain .Cho !Harry called after her but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle .There was total silence within the tea shop .Every eye was upon Harry .He threw a Galleon down onto the table shook pink confetti out of his eyes and followed Cho out of the door .It was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen .He simply did not understand what had happened half an hour ago they had been getting along fine .Women !he muttered angrily sloshing down the rainwashed street with his hands in his pockets .What did she want to talk about Cedric for anyway ?Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe ?He turned right and broke into a splashy run and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks .He knew he was too early to meet Hermione but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time .He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around .Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner looking morose .Hi Hagrid !he said when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him .Hagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognized him .Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises .Oh its you Harry said Hagrid .You all righ ?Yeah Im fine lied Harry in fact next to this battered and mournfullooking Hagrid he felt he did not have much to complain about .Er are you okay ?Me ?said Hagrid .Oh yeah Im grand Harry grand .He gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard which was the size of a large bucket and sighed .Harry did not know what to say to him .They sat side by side in silence for a moment .Then Hagrid said abruptly In the same boat you an me aren we Harry ?Er said Harry .Yeah .Ive said it before .Both outsiders like said Hagrid nodding wisely .An both orphans .Yeah .both orphans .He took a great swig from his tankard .Makes a diffrence havin a decent family he said .Me dad was decent .An your mum an dad were decent .If theyd lived life woulda bin diffrent eh ?Yeah .I spose said Harry cautiously .Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood .Family said Hagrid gloomily .Whatever yeh say bloods important .And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye .Hagrid said Harry unable to stop himself where are you getting all these injuries ?Eh ?said Hagrid looking startled .Wha injuries ?All those !said Harry pointing at Hagrid s face .Oh .thas jus normal bumps an bruises Harry said Hagrid dismissively .I got a rough job .He drained his tankard set it back upon the table and got to his feet .Ill be seeinyeh Harry .Take care now .And he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain .Harry watched him go feeling miserable .Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something but he seemed determined not to accept help .What was going on ?But before Harry could think about the matter any further he heard a voice calling his name .Harry !Harry over here !Hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room .He got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub .He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter ex journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermiones least favorite people in the world .Youre early !said Hermione moving along to give him room to sit down .I thought you were with Cho I wasnt expecting you for another hour at least !Cho ?said Rita at once twisting around in her seat to stare avidly at Harry .A girl ?She snatched up her crocodileskin handbag and groped within it .Its none of your business if Harrys been with a hundred girls Hermione told Rita coolly .So you can put that away right now .Rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid green quill from her bag .Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap she snapped her bag shut again .What are you up to ?Harry asked sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione .Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived said Rita taking a large slurp of her drink .I suppose Im allowed to talk to him am I ?she shot at Hermione .Yes I suppose you are said Hermione coldly .Unemployment did not suit Rita .The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face .The scarlet paint on her twoinch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses .She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth Pretty girl is she Harry ?One more word about Harrys love life and the deals off and thats a promise said Hermione irritably .What deal ?said Rita wiping her mouth on the back of her hand .You havent mentioned a deal yet Miss Prissy you just told me to turn up .Oh one of these days .She took a deep shuddering breath .Yes yes one of these days youll write more horrible stories about Harry and me said Hermione indifferently .Find someone who cares why dont you ?Theyve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help said Rita shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper How has that made you feel Harry ?Betrayed ?Distraught ?Misunderstood ?He feels angry of course said Hermione in a hard clear voice .Because hes told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Ministers too much of an idiot to believe him .So you actually stick to it do you that HeWho MustNotBeNamed is back ?said Rita lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag .You stand by all this garbage Dumbledores been telling everybody about You KnowWho returning and you being the sole witness ?I wasnt the sole witness snarled Harry .There were a dozenodd Death Eaters there as well .Want their names ?Id love them breathed Rita now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen .A great bold headline ‘Potter Accuses .A subheading ‘Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us .And then beneath a nice big photograph of you ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of YouKnowWhos attack Harry Potter 1 5 caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters .The QuickQuotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face .But of course she said lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione Little Miss Perfect wouldnt want that story out there would she ?As a matter of fact said Hermione sweetly thats exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want .Rita stared at her .So did Harry .Luna on the other hand sang Weasley Is Our King dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick .You want me to report what he says about HeWho MustNotBeNamed ?Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice .Yes I do said Hermione .The true story .All the facts .Exactly as Harry reports them .Hell give you all the details hell tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there hell tell you what Voldemort looks like now oh get a grip on yourself she added contemptuously throwing a napkin across the table for at the sound of Voldemorts name Rita had jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself .Rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat still staring at Hermione .Then she said baldly The Prophet wouldnt print it .In case you havent noticed nobody believes his cockandbull story .Everyone thinks hes delusional .Now if you let me write the story from that angle We dont need another story about how Harrys lost his marbles !said Hermione angrily .Weve had plenty of those already thank you !I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth !Theres no market for a story like that said Rita coldly .You mean the Prophet wont print it because Fudge wont let them said Hermione irritably .Rita gave Hermione a long hard look .Then leaning forward across the table toward her she said in a businesslike tone All right Fudge is leaning on the Prophet but it comes to the same thing .They wont print a story that shows Harry in a good light .Nobody wants to read it .Its against the public mood .This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough .People just dont want to believe YouKnow Whos back .So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear does it ?said Hermione scathingly .Rita sat up straight again her eyebrows raised and drained her glass of firewhisky .The Prophet exists to sell itself you silly girl she said coldly .My dad thinks its an awful paper said Luna chipping into the conversation unexpectedly .Sucking on her cocktail onion she gazed at Rita with her enormous protuberant slightly mad eyes .He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know .He doesnt care about making money .Rita looked disparagingly at Luna .Im guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter ?she said .Twentyfive Ways to Mingle with Muggles and the dates of the next Bring andFly Sale ?No said Luna dipping her onion back into her gillywater hes the editor of The Quibbler .Rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked around in alarm .‘Important stories he thinks the public needs to know ?she said witheringly .I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag .Well this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit isnt it ?said Hermione pleasantly .Luna says her fathers quite happy to take Harrys interview .Thats wholl be publishing it .Rita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great whoop of laughter .The Quibbleii she said cackling .You think people will take him seriously if hes published in The Quibbler ?Some people wont said Hermione in a level voice .But the Daily Prophets version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it .I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isnt a better explanation of what happened and if theres an alternative story available even if it is published in a she glanced sideways at Luna in a well an unusual magazine I think they might be rather keen to read it .Rita did not say anything for a while but eyed Hermione shrewdly her head a little to one side .All right lets say for a moment Ill do it she said abruptly .What kind of fee am I going to get ?I dont think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine said Luna dreamily .They do it because its an honor and of course to see their names in print .Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione .Im supposed to do this for free ?Well yes said Hermione calmly taking a sip of her drink .Otherwise as you very well know I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus .Of course the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insiders account of life in Azkaban .Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione s drink and thrust it up her nose .I dont suppose Ive got any choice have I ?said Rita her voice shaking slightly .She opened her crocodile bag once more withdrew a piece of parchment and raised her QuickQuotes Quill .Daddy will be pleased said Luna brightly .A muscle twitched in Ritas jaw .Okay Harry ?said Hermione turning to him .Ready to tell the public the truth ?I suppose said Harry watching Rita balancing the QuickQuotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them .Fire away then Rita said Hermione serenely fishing a cherry out of the bottom of her glass .SEEN AND UNFORESEEN Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Ritas interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of CrumpleHorned Snorkacks .And of course thatll be a very important story so Harrys might have to wait for the following issue said Luna .Harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when Voldemort had returned .Rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth .He wondered how people would react to the story .He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about CrumpleHorned Snorkacks .But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something whether it worked or not .Cant wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public said Dean sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night .Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chickenandham pie on Deans other side but Harry knew he was listening .Its the right thing to do Harry said Neville who was sitting opposite him .He was rather pale but went on in a low voice It must have been .tough .talking about it .Was it ?Yeah mumbled Harry but people have got to know what Voldemorts capable of havent they ?Thats right said Neville nodding and his Death Eaters too .People should know .Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato .Seamus looked up but when he caught Harrys eye he looked quickly back at his plate again .After a while Dean Seamus and Neville departed for the common room leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice .Cho Chang walked into the hall with her friend Marietta .Harrys stomach gave an unpleasant lurch but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him .Oh I forgot to ask you said Hermione brightly glancing over at the Ravenclaw table what happened on your date with Cho ?How come you were back so early ?Er .well it was .said Harry pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble toward him and helping himself to seconds a complete fiasco now that you mention it .And he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop . .so then he finished several minutes later as the final bit of crumble disappeared she jumps up right and says ‘111 see you around Harry and runs out of the place !He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione .I mean what was all that about ?What was going on ?Hermione glanced over at the back of Chos head and sighed .Oh Harry she said sadly .Well Im sorry but you were a bit tactless .Me tactless ?said Harry outraged .One minute we were getting on fine next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop how was I supposed to feel about that ?Well you see said Hermione with the patient air of one explaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler you shouldnt have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date .But but spluttered Harry but you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along how was I supposed to do that without telling her ?You should have told her differently said Hermione still with that maddeningly patient air .You should have said it was really annoying but Id made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks and you really didnt want to go youd much rather spend the whole day with her but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please please come along with you and hopefully youd be able to get away more quickly ?And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too Hermione added as an afterthought .But I dont think youre ugly said Harry bemused .Hermione laughed .Harry youre worse than Ron .Well no youre not she sighed as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy .Look you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me so she tried to make you jealous .It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her .Is that what she was doing ?said Harry as Ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach toward himself .Well wouldnt it have been easier if shed just asked me whether I liked her better than you ?Girls dont often ask questions like that said Hermione .Well they should !said Harry forcefully .Then I couldve just told her I fancy her and she wouldnt have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying !Im not saying what she did was sensible said Hermione as Ginny joined them just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled .Im just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time .You should write a book Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them .Yeah said Harry fervently looking over at the Ravenclaw table .Cho had just got up still not looking at him she left the Great Hall .Feeling rather depressed he looked back at Ron and Ginny .So how was Quidditch practice ?It was a nightmare said Ron in a surly voice .Oh come on said Hermione looking at Ginny Im sure it wasnt that Yes it was said Ginny .It was appalling .Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it .Ron and Ginny went off for baths after dinner Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework .Harry had been struggling with a new star chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up .Ron and Ginny not here ?asked Fred looking around as he pulled up a chair and when Harry shook his head he said Good .We were watching their practice .Theyre going to be slaughtered .Theyre complete rubbish without us .Come on Ginnys not bad said George fairly sitting down next to Fred .Actually I dunno how she got so good seeing how we never let her play with us .Shes been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you werent looking said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books .Oh said George looking mildly impressed .Well thatd explain it .Has Ron saved a goal yet ?asked Hermione peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms .Well he can do it if he doesnt think anyones watching him said Fred rolling his eyes .So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday .He got up again and moved restlessly to the window staring out across the dark grounds .You know Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for .Hermione cast him a stern look .Youve got exams coming !Told you already were not fussed about N .E .W .T .s said Fred .The Snackboxes are ready to roll we found out how to get rid of those boils just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them Lee put us onto it .George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky .I dunno if I even want to watch this match .If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself .Kill him more like said Fred firmly .Thats the trouble with Quidditch said Hermione absentmindedly once again bent over her Rune translation it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the Houses .She looked up to find her copy of Spellmans Syllabary and caught Fred George and Harry looking at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces .Well it does !she said impatiently .Its only a game isnt it ?Hermione said Harry shaking his head youre good on feelings and stuff but you just dont understand about Quidditch .Maybe not she said darkly returning to her translation again but at least my happiness doesnt depend on Rons goalkeeping ability .And though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either .The very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twentytwo minutes of agony .It was hard to say what the worst thing was Harry thought it was a closerun contest between Rons fourteenth failed save Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle .The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerbys nose so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty .Good catch Harry told Ginny back in the common room where the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral .I was lucky she shrugged .It wasnt a very fast Snitch and Summerbys got a cold he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment .Anyway once youre back on the team Ginny Ive got a lifelong ban .Youre banned as long as Umbridge is in the school Ginny corrected him .Theres a difference .Anyway once youre back I think Ill try out for Chaser .Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goalscoring to Seeking anyway .Harry looked over at Ron who was hunched in a corner staring at his knees a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand .Angelina still wont let him resign Ginny said as though reading Harrys mind .She says she knows hes got it in him .Harry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team .Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of Weasley Is Our King sung with great gusto by the Slytherins who were now favorites to win the Quidditch Cup .Fred and George wandered over .I havent got the heart to take the mickey out of him even said Fred looking over at Rons crumpled figure .Mind you .when he missed the fourteenth He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright doggypaddle .Well Ill save it for parties eh ?Ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this .Out of respect for his feelings Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to .Sure enough when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible .Harry got into bed thinking about the match .It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines .He was quite impressed by Ginnys performance but he felt that if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner .There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirkes ankle if she hadnt hesitated she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor .Umbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione .Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him her wide toads mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile .The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark .After a few minutes however he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson .He tried for a moment or two but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them .Slowly Rons snores died away replaced by the sound of deep slow breathing .It took Harry much longer to get to sleep his body was tired but it took his brain a long time to close down .He dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes .He watched them happily for a while then decided to go and find the other members of the D .A .But when he left the room he found himself facing not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall .He turned his head slowly to the left .There at the far end of the windowless passage was a plain black door .He walked toward it with a sense of mounting excitement .He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last and find the way to open it .He was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the righthand side .The door was ajar .He stretched out his hand to push it wide and Ron gave a loud rasping genuine snore and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness to open a door that was hundreds of miles away .He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt .He knew he should not have seen the door but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron .If he could have saved his snore for just another minute .k k k They entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning .Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet Nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters who despite many reported sightings had still not been caught .She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice as he had only received one note during the entire year he was sure when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him that it had made a mistake .Who re you after ?he asked it languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipients name and address Harry Potter Great Hall Hogwarts School Frowning he made to take the letter from the owl but before he could do so three four five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position treading in the butter knocking over the salt and each attempting to give him their letters first .Whats going on ?Ron asked in amazement as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forward to watch as another seven owls landed amongst the first ones screeching hooting and flapping their wings .Harry !said Hermione breathlessly plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long cylindrical package .I think I know what this means open this one first !Harry ripped off the brown packaging .Out rolled a tightly furled copy of Marchs edition of The Quibbler .He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover .In large red letters across his picture were the words HARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST THE TRUTH ABOUT HEWHOMUSTNOTBE NAMED AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN Its good isnt it ?said Luna who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between Fred and Ron .It came out yesterday I asked Dad to send you a free copy .I expect all these she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry are letters from readers .Thats what I thought said Hermione eagerly Harry dyou mind if we ?Help yourself said Harry feeling slightly bemused .Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes .This ones from a bloke who thinks youre off your rocker said Ron glancing down his letter .Ah well This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St .Mungos said Hermione looking disappointed and crumpling up a second .This one looks okay though said Harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley .Hey she says she believes me !This ones in two minds said Fred who had joined in the letteropening with enthusiasm .Says you dont come across as a mad person but he really doesnt want to believe YouKnow Whos back so he doesnt know what to think now .Blimey what a waste of parchment .Heres another one youve convinced Harry !said Hermione excitedly . ‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly .Little though I want to think that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has returned I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth .Oh this is wonderful !Another one who thinks youre barking said Ron throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder but this one says youve got her converted and she now thinks youre a real hero shes put in a photograph too wow What is going on here ?said a falsely sweet girlish voice .Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes .Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna her bulging toads eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry .Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly .Why have you got all these letters Mr Potter ?she asked slowly .Is that a crime now ?said Fred loudly .Getting mail ?Be careful Mr Weasley or I shall have to put you in detention said Umbridge .Well Mr Potter ?Harry hesitated but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridges attention .People have written to me because I gave an interview said Harry .About what happened to me last June .For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this .He had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before but when he looked Dumbledore seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick .An interview ?repeated Umbridge her voice thinner and higher than ever .What do you mean ?I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them said Harry .Here And he threw the copy of The Quibbler at her .She caught it and stared down at the cover .Her pale doughy face turned an ugly patchy violet .When did you do this ?she asked her voice trembling slightly .Last Hogsmeade weekend said Harry .She looked up at him incandescent with rage the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers .There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you Mr Potter she whispered .How you dare .how you could .She took a deep breath .I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies .The message apparently has still not sunk in .Fifty points from Gryffindor and another weeks worth of detentions .She stalked away clutching The Quibbler to her chest the eyes of many students following her .By midmorning enormous signs had been put up all over the school not just on House notice boards but in the corridors and classrooms too .BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS Any student found in possession of the magazine The Quibbler will be expelled .The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twentyseven .Signed Dolores Jane Umbridge HIGH INQUISITOR For some reason every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure .What exactly are you so happy about ?Harry asked her .Oh Harry dont you see ?Hermione breathed .If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview it was banning it !And it seemed that Hermione was quite right .By the end of that day though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview at each other Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes .And then they spotted me and obviously they know I know you so they were bombarding me with questions Hermione told Harry her eyes shining and Harry I think they believe you I really do I think youve finally got them convinced !Meanwhile Professor Umbridge was stalking the school stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets .Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler but the students were several steps ahead of her .The pages carrying Harrys interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again .Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it .The teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twentysix but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same .Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of Charms said Shh and hurried away and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class and a very disapproving Umbridge that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all but would live to a ripe old age become Minister of Magic and have twelve children .But what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day .Before he knew what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear Im really really sorry .That interview was so brave .it made me cry .He was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it but very glad they were on speaking terms again and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again .And unbelievably no sooner had he arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as good happened Seamus stepped out of the queue to face him .I just wanted to say he mumbled squinting at Harrys left knee I believe you .And Ive sent a copy of that magazine to me mam .If anything more was needed to complete Harrys happiness it was Malfoy Crabbe and Goyles reactions .He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library together with a weedylooking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott .They looked around at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment and Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe .Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this He had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters .And the best bit is whispered Hermione gleefully as they left the library they cant contradict you because they cant admit theyve read the article !To cap it all Luna told him over dinner that no copy of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster .Dads reprinting !she told Harry her eyes popping excitedly .He cant believe it he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple Horned Snorkacks !Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night daringly Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall so that Harrys giant head gazed down upon the proceedings occasionally saying things like The Ministry are morons and Eat dung Umbridge in a booming voice .Hermione did not find this very amusing she said it interfered with her concentration and ended up going to bed early out of irritation .Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two especially when the talking spell had started to wear off so that it merely shouted disconnected words like Dung and Umbridge at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice .In fact it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again .To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time he announced that he too needed an early night .The dormitory was empty when he reached it .He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed it felt soothing against his scar .Then he undressed and got into bed wishing his headache would go away .He also felt slightly sick .He rolled over onto his side closed his eyes and fell asleep almost at once .He was standing in a dark curtained room lit by a single branch of candles .His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him .They were long fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large pale spiders against the dark velvet of the chair .Beyond the chair in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles knelt a man in black robes .I have been badly advised it seems said Harry in a high cold voice that pulsed with anger .Master I crave your pardon .croaked the man kneeling on the floor .The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight .He seemed to be trembling .I do not blame you Rookwood said Harry in that cold cruel voice .He relinquished his grip upon the chair and walked around it closer to the man cowering upon the floor until he stood directly over him in the darkness looking down from a far greater height than usual .You are sure of your facts Rookwood ?asked Harry .Yes My Lord yes .I used to work in the department after after all .Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it .Bode could never have taken it Master .Bode would have known he could not .Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against Malfoys Imperius Curse .Stand up Rookwood whispered Harry .The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey .His face was pockmarked the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight .He remained a little stooped when standing as though halfway through a bow and he darted terrified looks up at Harrys face .You have done well to tell me this said Harry .Very well .I have wasted months on fruitless schemes it seems .But no matter .We begin again from now .You have Lord Voldemorts gratitude Rookwood .My Lord .yes My Lord gasped Rookwood his voice hoarse with relief .I shall need your help .I shall need all the information you can give me .Of course My Lord of course .anything .Very well .you may go .Send Avery to me .Rookwood scurried backward bowing and disappeared through a door .Left alone in the dark room Harry turned toward the wall .A cracked agespotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows .Harry moved toward it .His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness .A face whiter than a skull .red eyes with slits for pupils .NOOOOOOOOO !What ?yelled a voice nearby .Harry flailed around madly became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed .For a few seconds he did not know where he was he was convinced that he was about to see the white skulllike face looming at him out of the dark again then Rons voice spoke very near to him .Will you stop acting like a maniac and I can get you out of here !Ron wrenched the hangings apart and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight as he lay flat on his back his scar searing with pain .Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed one arm was out of his robes .Has someone been attacked again ?asked Ron pulling Harry roughly to his feet .Is it Dad ?Is it that snake ?No everyones fine gasped Harry whose forehead felt as though it was on fire again .Well .Avery isnt .Hes in trouble .He gave him the wrong information .Hes really angry .Harry groaned and sank shaking onto his bed rubbing his scar .But Rookwoods going to help him now .Hes on the right track again .What are you talking about ?said Ron sounding scared .Dyou mean .did you just see YouKnow Who ?I was YouKnowWho said Harry and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they were no longer deathly white and longfingered .He was with Rookwood hes one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban remember ?Rookwoods just told him Bode couldnt have done it .Done what ?Remove something .He said Bode would have known he couldnt have done it .Bode was under the Imperius Curse .I think he said Malfoys dad put it on him .Bode was bewitched to remove something ?Ron said .But Harry thats got to be The weapon Harry finished the sentence for him .I know .The dormitory door opened Dean and Seamus came in .Harry swung his legs back into bed .He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter .Did you say murmured Ron putting his head close to Harrys on the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table that you were You KnowWho ?Yeah said Harry quietly .Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water .Harry saw it spill over his chin onto his chest .Harry he said as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily pulling off their robes and talking youve got to tell I havent got to tell anyone said Harry shortly .I wouldnt have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency .Im supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out .Thats what they want .By they he meant Dumbledore .He got back into bed and rolled over onto his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Rons mattress creak as he lay back down too .His scar began to burn he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise .Somewhere he knew Avery was being punished .Harry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened .They wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard .Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember .When he had finished she said nothing at all for a few moments but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard .So thats why they killed him she said quietly withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last .When Bode tried to steal this weapon something funny happened to him .I think there must be defensive spells on it or around it to stop people from touching it .Thats why he was in St .Mungos his brain had gone all funny and he couldnt talk .But remember what the Healer told us ?He was recovering .And they couldnt risk him getting better could they ?I mean the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift .Once hed got his voice back hed explain what hed been doing wouldnt he ?They would have known hed been sent to steal the weapon .Of course it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him .Never out of the Ministry is he ?He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing said Harry .In the hang on .he said slowly .He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day !Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing but what if Sturgis gasped Hermione looking thunderstruck .Sorry ?said Ron looking bewildered .Sturgis Podmore said Hermione breathlessly .Arrested for trying to get through a door .Lucius Malfoy got him too .I bet he did it the day you saw him there Harry .Sturgis had Moodys Invisibility Cloak right ?So what if he was standing guard by the door invisible and Malfoy heard him move or guessed he was there or just did the Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there ?So when Sturgis next had an opportunity probably when it was his turn on guard duty again he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort Ron be quiet but he got caught and sent to Azkaban .She gazed at Harry .And now Rookwoods told Voldemort how to get the weapon ?I didnt hear all the conversation but thats what it sounded like said Harry .Rookwood used to work there .Maybe Voldemortll send Rookwood to do it ?Hermione nodded apparently still lost in thought .Then quite abruptly she said But you shouldnt have seen this at all Harry .What ?he said taken aback .Youre supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing said Hermione suddenly stern .I know I am said Harry .But Well I think we should just try and forget what you saw said Hermione firmly .And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on .Harry was so angry with her that he did not talk to her for the rest of the day which proved to be another bad one .When people were not discussing the escaped Death Eaters in the corridors today they were laughing at Gryffindors abysmal performance in their match against Hufflepuff the Slytherins were singing Weasley Is Our King so loudly and frequently that by sundown Filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation .The week did not improve as it progressed Harry received two more Ds in Potions was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in which he had seen Voldemort though he did not bring it up with Ron and Hermione again because he did not want another tellingoff from Hermione .He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it but that was out of the question so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind .Unfortunately the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been .Get up Potter .A couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood Harry was to be found yet again kneeling on the floor of Snapes office trying to clear his head .He had just been forced yet again to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realized he still had most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school .That last memory said Snape .What was it ?I dont know said Harry getting wearily to his feet .He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth .You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet ?No said Snape softly .I mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room .Its .nothing said Harry .Snapes dark eyes bored into Harrys .Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency Harry blinked and looked away .How do that man and that room come to be inside your head Potter ?said Snape .It said Harry looking everywhere but at Snape it was just a dream I had .A dream repeated Snape .There was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a purple liquid in its jar .You do know why we are here dont you Potter ?said Snape in a low dangerous voice .You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job ?Yes said Harry stiffly .Remind me why we are here Potter .So I can learn Occlumency said Harry now glaring at a dead eel .Correct Potter .And dim though you may be Harry looked back at Snape hating him I would have thought that after two months worth of lessons you might have made some progress .How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had ?Just that one lied Harry .Perhaps said Snape his dark cold eyes narrowing slightly perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams Potter .Maybe they make you feel special important ?No they dont said Harry his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand .That is just as well Potter said Snape coldly because you are neither special nor important and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters .No thats your job isnt it ?Harry shot at him .He had not meant to say it it had burst out of him in temper .For a long moment they stared at each other Harry convinced he had gone too far .But there was a curious almost satisfied expression on Snapes face when he answered .Yes Potter he said his eyes glinting .That is my job .Now if you are ready we will start again .He raised his wand .One two three LegilimensV A hundred dementors were swooping toward Harry across the lake in the grounds .He screwed up his face in concentration .They were coming closer .He could see the dark holes beneath their hoods .yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him his eyes fixed upon Harrys face muttering under his breath .And somehow Snape was growing clearer and the dementors were growing fainter .Harry raised his own wand .Protegol Snape staggered his wand flew upward away from Harry and suddenly Harrys mind was teeming with memories that were not his a hooknosed man was shouting at a cowering woman while a small darkhaired boy cried in a corner .A greasyhaired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom pointing his wand at the ceiling shooting down flies .A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick ENOUGH !Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest he took several staggering steps backward hit some of the shelves covering Snapes walls and heard something crack .Snape was shaking slightly very white in the face .The back of Harrys robes were damp .One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion .Reparo hissed Snape and the jar sealed itself once more .Well Potter .that was certainly an improvement .Panting slightly Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson almost as though checking that they were still there .I dont remember telling you to use a Shield Charm .but there is no doubt that it was effective .Harry did not speak he felt that to say anything might be dangerous .He was sure he had just broken into Snapes memories that he had just seen scenes from Snapes childhood and it was unnerving to think that the crying little boy who had watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes .Lets try again shall we ?said Snape .Harry felt a thrill of dread He was about to pay for what had just happened he was sure of it .They moved back into position with the desk between them Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time .On the count of three then said Snape raising his wand once more .One two Harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind for Snape had already cried Legilimens He was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mysteries past the blank stone walls past the torches the plain black door was growing ever larger he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it he was feet from it and he could see that chink of faint blue light again The door had flown open !He was through it at last inside a blackwalled blackfloored circular room lit with blueflamed candles and there were more doors all around him he needed to go on but which door ought he to take ?POTTER !Harry opened his eyes .He was flat on his back again with no memory of having gotten there he was also panting as though he really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room .Explain yourself !said Snape who was standing over him looking furious .I .dunno what happened said Harry truthfully standing up .There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish .Ive never seen that before .I mean I told you Ive dreamed about the door .but its never opened before .You are not working hard enough !For some reason Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before when Harry had seen into his own memories .You are lazy and sloppy Potter it is small wonder that the Dark Lord Can you tell me something sir ?said Harry firing up again .Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord Ive only ever heard Death Eaters call him that Snape opened his mouth in a snarl and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room .Snapes head jerked upward he was gazing at the ceiling .What the ?he muttered .Harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the entrance hall .Snape looked around at him frowning .Did you see anything unusual on your way down here Potter ?Harry shook his head .Somewhere above them the woman screamed again .Snape strode to his office door his wand still held at the ready and swept out of sight .Harry hesitated for a moment then followed .The screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall they grew louder as Harry ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dungeons .When he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed .Students had come flooding out of the Great Hall where dinner was still in progress to see what was going on .Others had crammed themselves onto the marble staircase .Harry pushed forward through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring some of them looking shocked others even frightened .Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the hall she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick .Professor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other looking utterly mad .Her hair was sticking up on end her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams .Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her one of them upside down it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her .Professor Trelawney was staring apparently terrified at something Harry could not see but that seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs .No !she shrieked .NO !This cannot be happening .It cannot .I refuse to accept it !You didnt realize this was coming ?said a high girlish voice sounding callously amused and Harry moving slightly to his right saw that Trelawneys terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge .Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections and lack of any improvement would make it inevitable you would be sacked ?You ccant !howled Professor Trelawney tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses you ccant sack me !Ive bbeen here sixteen years !HHogwarts is mmy hhome !It was your home said Professor Umbridge and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink sobbing uncontrollably onto one of her trunks until an hour ago when the Minister of Magic countersigned the order for your dismissal .Now kindly remove yourself from this hall .You are embarrassing us .But she stood and watched with an expression of gloating enjoyment as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned rocking backward and forward on her trunk in paroxysms of grief .Harry heard a sob to his left and looked around .Lavender and Parvati were both crying silently their arms around each other .Then he heard footsteps .Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes .There there Sibyll .Calm down .Blow your nose on this .Its not as bad as you think now .You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts .Oh really Professor McGonagall ?said Umbridge in a deadly voice taking a few steps forward .And your authority for that statement is . ?That would be mine said a deep voice .The oak front doors had swung open .Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance .What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night .Leaving the doors wide behind him he strode forward through the circle of onlookers toward the place where Professor Trelawney sat tearstained and trembling upon her trunk Professor McGonagall alongside her .Yours Professor Dumbledore ?said Umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh .Im afraid you do not understand the position .I have here she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of Magic .Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twentythree the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect place upon probation and sack any teacher she that is to say I feel is not performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic .I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch .I have dismissed her .To Harrys very great surprise Dumbledore continued to smile .He looked down at Professor Trelawney who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk and said You are quite right of course Professor Umbridge .As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers .You do not however have the authority to send them away from the castle .I am afraid he went on with a courteous little bow that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts .At this Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccup was barely hidden .No no Ill ggo Dumbledore !I shshall 1leave Hogwarts and sseek my fortune elsewhere No said Dumbledore sharply .It is my wish that you remain Sibyll .He turned to Professor McGonagall .Might I ask you to escort Sibyll back upstairs Professor McGonagall ?Of course said McGonagall .Up you get Sibyll .Professor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawneys other arm .Together they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs .Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them his wand held out before him he squeaked Locomotor trunksl and Professor Trelawneys luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear .Professor Umbridge was standing stockstill staring at Dumbledore who continued to smile benignly .And what she said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all around the entrance hall are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings ?Oh that wont be a problem said Dumbledore pleasantly .You see I have already found us a new Divination teacher and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor .Youve found ?said Umbridge shrilly .Youve found ?Might I remind you Dumbledore that under Educational Decree Twentytwo the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if and only if the headmaster is unable to find one said Dumbledore .And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded .May I introduce you ?He turned to face the open front doors through which night mist was now drifting .Harry heard hooves .There was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther backward some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer .Through the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest whiteblond hair and astonishingly blue eyes the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse .This is Firenze said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge .I think you 11 find him suitable .THE CENTAUR AND THE SNEAK Ill bet you wish you hadnt given up Divination now dont you Hermione ?asked Parvati smirking .It was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon .They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning .Not really said Hermione indifferently who was reading the Daily Prophet Ive never really liked horses .She turned a page of the newspaper scanning its columns .Hes not a horse hes a centaur !said Lavender sounding shocked .A gorgeous centaur .sighed Parvati .Either way hes still got four legs said Hermione coolly .Anyway I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone ?We are !Lavender assured her .We went up to her office to see her we took her some daffodils not the honking ones that Sprouts got nice ones .How is she ?asked Harry .Not very good poor thing said Lavender sympathetically .She was crying and saying shed rather leave the castle forever than stay here if Umbridge is still here and I dont blame her .Umbridge was horrible to her wasnt she ?Ive got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible said Hermione darkly .Impossible said Ron who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon .She cant get any worse than shes been already .You mark my words shes going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her said Hermione closing the newspaper .Especially another parthuman .You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze .After breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class and Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall heading for Divination .Arent we going up to North Tower ?asked Ron looking puzzled as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase .Parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him .How dyou expect Firenze to climb that ladder ?Were in classroom eleven now it was on the notice board yesterday .Classroom eleven was situated in the groundfloor corridor leading off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall .Harry knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom .When he entered it right behind Ron and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing he was therefore momentarily stunned .What the ?The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft dappled green light .The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests looking rather nervous .In the middle of the room where there were no trees stood Firenze .Harry Potter he said holding out a hand when Harry entered .Er hi said Harry shaking hands with the centaur who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile .Er good to see you .And you said the centaur inclining his whiteblond head .It was foretold that we would meet again .Harry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof shaped bruise on Firenzes chest .As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor he saw that they were all looking at him with awe apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze whom they seemed to find intimidating .When the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket Firenze gestured around the room .Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us said Firenze when everyone had settled down in imitation of my natural habitat .I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden Forest which was until Monday my home .but this is not possible .Please er sir said Parvati breathlessly raising her hand why not ?Weve been in there with Hagrid were not frightened !It is not a question of your bravery said Firenze but of my position .I can no longer return to the forest .My herd has banished me .Herd ?said Lavender in a confused voice and Harry knew she was thinking of cows .What oh !Comprehension dawned on her face .There are more of you ?she said stunned .Did Hagrid breed you like the thestrals ?asked Dean eagerly .Firenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean who seemed to realize at once that he had said something very offensive .I didnt I meant sorry he finished in a hushed voice .Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans said Firenze quietly .There was a pause then Parvati raised her hand again .Please sir .why have the other centaurs banished you ?Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore said Firenze .They see this as a betrayal of our kind .Harry remembered how nearly four years ago the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his back calling him a common mule .He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest .Let us begin said Firenze .He swished his long palomino tail raised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it slowly and as he did so the light in the room dimmed so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight and stars emerged upon the ceiling .There were oohs and gasps and Ron said audibly Blimey !Lie back upon the floor said Firenze in his calm voice and observe the heavens .Here is written for those who can see the fortune of our races .Harry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling .A twinkling red star winked at him from overhead .I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy said Firenzes calm voice and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens .Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries .Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us .Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us !said Parvati excitedly raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back .Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that and when it makes an angle to Saturn like now she drew a right angle in the air above her that means that people need to be extra careful when handling hot things That said Firenze calmly is human nonsense .Parvatis hand fell limply to her side .Trivial hurts tiny human accidents said Firenze as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor .These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe and are unaffected by planetary movements .Professor Trelawney began Parvati in a hurt and indignant voice .is a human said Firenze simply .And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind .Harry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati .She looked very offended as did several of the people surrounding her .Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen I do not know continued Firenze and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them but she wastes her time in the main on the self flattering nonsense humans call fortunetelling .I however am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs which is impersonal and impartial .We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there .It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing .Firenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry .In the past decade the indications have been that Wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars .Mars bringer of battle shines brightly above us suggesting that the fight must break out again soon .How soon centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves by the observation of fume and flame .It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended .They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this that it took centaurs years and years to become competent and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly .He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had .His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew but rather to impress upon them that nothing not even centaurs knowledge was foolproof .Hes not very definite on anything is he ?said Ron in a low voice as they put out their mallowsweet fire .I mean I could do with a few more details about this war were about to have couldnt you ?The bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped Harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the castle quite convinced that he was really in the forest .The class filed out looking slightly perplexed Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called Harry Potter a word please .Harry turned .The centaur advanced a little toward him .Ron hesitated .You may stay Firenze told him .But close the door please .Ron hastened to obey .Harry Potter you are a friend of Hagrids are you not ?said the centaur .Yes said Harry .Then give him a warning from me .His attempt is not working .He would do better to abandon it .His attempt is not working ?Harry repeated blankly .And he would do better to abandon it said Firenze nodding .I would warn Hagrid myself but I am banished it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now Hagrid has troubles enough without a centaurs battle .But whats Hagrid attempting to do ?said Harry nervously .Firenze looked at Harry impassively .Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service said Firenze and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures .I shall not betray his secret .But he must be brought to his senses .The attempt is not working .Tell him Harry Potter .Good day to you .The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated .As a dull March blurred into a squally April his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again .Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenzes warning to Hagrid .At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after class one day .When he passed on Firenzes message Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy blackened eyes apparently taken aback .Then he seemed to pull himself together .Nice bloke Firenze he said gruffly but he don know what hes talkin abou on this .The attemps cornin on fine .Hagrid whatre you up to ?asked Harry seriously .Because youve got to be careful Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me shes on a roll .If youre doing anything you shouldnt be Theres things more importan than keepin a job said Hagrid though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor .Don worry abou me Harry jus get along now theres a good lad .Harry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle .Meanwhile as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them the O .W .L .s were drawing ever nearer .All the fifth years were suffering from stress to some degree but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now .If it had not been for the D .A .lessons Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy .He sometimes felt that he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow D .A .members and saw how far they had come .Indeed Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the D .A .received Outstanding in their Defense Against the Dark Arts O .W .L .s .They had finally started work on Patronuses which everybody had been very keen to practice though as Harry kept reminding them producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different to producing it when confronted by something like a dementor .Oh dont be such a killjoy said Cho brightly watching her silvery swanshaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter .Theyre so pretty !Theyre not supposed to be pretty theyre supposed to protect you said Harry patiently .What we really need is a boggart or something thats how I learned I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor But that would be really scary !said Lavender who was shooting puffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand .And I still cant do it !she added angrily .Neville was having trouble too .His face was screwed up in concentration but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip .Youve got to think of something happy Harry reminded him .Im trying said Neville miserably who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat .Harry I think Im doing it !yelled Seamus who had been brought along to his first ever D .A .meeting by Dean .Look ah its gone .But it was definitely something hairy Harry !Hermiones Patronus a shining silver otter was gamboling around her .They are sort of nice arent they ?she said looking at it fondly .The door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed again Harry looked around to see who had entered but there did not seem to be anybody there .It was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent .Next thing he knew something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee .He looked down and saw to his very great astonishment Dobby the houseelf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hats .Hi Dobby !he said .What are you whats wrong ?For the elfs eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking .The members of the D .A .closest to Harry had fallen silent now Everybody in the room was watching Dobby .The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist leaving the room looking much darker than before .Harry Potter sir .squeaked the elf trembling from head to foot Harry Potter sir .Dobby has come to warn you .but the houseelves have been warned not to tell .He ran headfirst at the wall Harry who had some experience of Dobbys habits of selfpunishment made to seize him but Dobby merely bounced off the stone cushioned by his eight hats .Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy .Whats happened Dobby ?Harry asked grabbing the elfs tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself .Harry Potter .she .she .Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist Harry seized that too .Whos ‘she Dobby ?But he thought he knew surely only one she could induce such fear in Dobby ?The elf looked up at him slightly crosseyed and mouthed wordlessly .Umbridge ?asked Harry horrified .Dobby nodded then tried to bang his head off Harrys knees Harry held him at bay .What about her ?Dobby she hasnt found out about this about us about the D .A .He read the answer in the elfs stricken face .His hands held fast by Harry the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor .Is she coming ?Harry asked quietly .Dobby let out a howl and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor .Yes Harry Potter yes !Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf .WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?Harry bellowed .RUN !They all pelted toward the exit at once forming a scrum at the door then people burst through Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories .It was only ten to nine if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery which were both nearer Harry come on !shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out .He scooped up Dobby who was still attempting to do himself serious injury and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue .Dobby this is an order get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and if she asks you whether you warned me lie and say no !said Harry .And I forbid you to hurt yourself !he added dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him .Thank you Harry Potter !squeaked Dobby and he streaked off .Harry glanced left and right the others were all moving so fast that he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished .He started to run right there was a boys bathroom up ahead he could pretend hed been in there all the time if he could just reach it aaRGH !Something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt .Someone behind him was laughing .He rolled over onto his back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragonshaped vase .Trip Jinx Potter !he said .Hey Professor PROFESSOR !Ive got one !Umbridge came bustling around the far corner breathless but wearing a delighted smile .Its him !she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor .Excellent Draco excellent oh very good fifty points to Slytherin !Ill take him from here .Stand up Potter !Harry got to his feet glaring at the pair of them .He had never seen Umbridge looking so happy .She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and turned beaming broadly to Malfoy .You hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them Draco she said .Tell the others to look in the library anybody out of breath check the bathrooms Miss Parkinson can do the girls ones off you go and you she added in her softest most dangerous voice as Malfoy walked away .You can come with me to the headmasters office Potter .They were at the stone gargoyle within minutes .Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught .He thought of Ron Mrs Weasley would kill him and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her O .W .L .s .And it had been Seamuss very first meeting .and Neville had been getting so good .Fizzing Whizbee sang Umbridge and the stone gargoyle jumped aside the wall behind split open and they ascended the moving stone staircase .They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker but Umbridge did not bother to knock she strode straight inside still holding tight to Harry .The office was full of people .Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk his expression serene the tips of his long fingers together .Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him her face extremely tense .Cornelius Fudge Minister of Magic was rocking backward and forward on his toes beside the fire apparently immensely pleased with the situation .Kingsley Shacklebolt and a toughlooking wizard Harry did not recognize with very short wiry hair were positioned on either side of the door like guards and the freckled bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands apparently poised to take notes .The portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not shamming sleep tonight .All of them were watching what was happening below alert and serious .As Harry entered a few flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors ears .Harry pulled himself free of Umbridges grasp as the door swung shut behind them .Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction upon his face .Well he said .Well well well .Harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster .His heart drummed madly inside him but his brain was oddly cool and clear .He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower said Umbridge .There was an indecent excitement in her voice the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall .The Malfoy boy cornered him .Did he did he ?said Fudge appreciatively .I must remember to tell Lucius .Well Potter .I expect you know why you are here ?Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes His mouth had opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of Dumbledores face .Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder but as Harry stared at him he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side .Harry changed direction mid word .Yeh no .I beg your pardon ?said Fudge .No said Harry firmly .You dont know why you are here ?No I dont said Harry .Fudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink .So you have no idea said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office ?You are not aware that you have broken any school rules ?School rules ?said Harry .No .Or Ministry decrees ?amended Fudge angrily .Not that Im aware of said Harry blandly .His heart was still hammering very fast .It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudges blood pressure rising but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them .If somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the D .A .then he the leader might as well be packing his trunk right now .So its news to you is it said Fudge his voice now thick with anger that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school ?Yes it is said Harry hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto his face .I think Minister said Umbridge silkily from beside him we might make better progress if I fetch our informant .Yes yes do said Fudge nodding and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room .Theres nothing like a good witness is there Dumbledore ?Nothing at all Cornelius said Dumbledore gravely inclining his head .There was a wait of several minutes in which nobody looked at each other then Harry heard the door open behind him .Umbridge moved past him into the room gripping by the shoulder Chos curlyhaired friend Marietta who was hiding her face in her hands .Dont be scared dear dont be frightened said Professor Umbridge softly patting her on the back its quite all right now .You have done the right thing .The minister is very pleased with you .Hell be telling your mother what a good girl youve been .Mariettas mother Minister she added looking up at Fudge is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation .Floo Network office shes been helping us police the Hogwarts fires you know .Jolly good jolly good !said Fudge heartily .Like mother like daughter eh ?Well come on now dear look up dont be shy lets hear what youve got to galloping gargoyles !As Marietta raised her head Fudge leapt backward in shock nearly landing himself in the fire .He cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke and Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes but not before the whole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word SNEAK .Never mind the spots now dear said Umbridge impatiently just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister But Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically .Oh very well you silly girl Ill tell him snapped Umbridge .She hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said Well Minister Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me .She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor sometimes known as the Room of Requirement I would find out something to my advantage .I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there .Unfortunately at that point this hex she waved impatiently at Mariettas concealed face came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more .Well now said Fudge fixing Marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look .It is very brave of you my dear coming to tell Professor Umbridge you did exactly the right thing .Now will you tell me what happened at this meeting ?What was its purpose ?Who was there ?But Marietta would not speak .She merely shook her head again her eyes wide and fearful .Havent we got a counterjinx for this ?Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently gesturing at Mariettas face .So she can speak freely ?I have not yet managed to find one Umbridge admitted grudgingly and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermiones jinxing ability .But it doesnt matter if she wont speak I can take up the story from here .You will remember Minister that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hogs Head in Hogsmeade And what is your evidence for that ?cut in Professor McGonagall .I have testimony from Willy Widdershins Minerva who happened to be in the bar at the time .He was heavily bandaged it is true but his hearing was quite unimpaired said Umbridge smugly .He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me Oh so thats why he wasnt prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets !said Professor McGonagall raising her eyebrows .What an interesting insight into our justice system !Blatant corruption !roared the portrait of the corpulent rednosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledores desk .The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day no sir they did not !Thank you Fortescue that will do said Dumbledore softly .The purpose of Potters meeting with these students continued Professor Umbridge was to persuade them to join an illegal society whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for schoolage I think you 11 find youre wrong there Dolores said Dumbledore quietly peering at her over the half moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose .Harry stared at him .He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he said in the Hogs Head there was simply no escaping it .Oho !said Fudge bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again .Yes do lets hear the latest cockandbull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble !Go on then Dumbledore go on Willy Widdershins was lying was he ?Or was it Potters identical twin in the Hogs Head that day ?Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible dementors ?Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh .Oh very good Minister very good !Harry could have kicked him .Then he saw to his astonishment that Dumbledore was smiling gently too .Cornelius I do not deny and nor I am sure does Harry that he was in the Hogs Head that day nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group .I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was at that time illegal .If you remember the Ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harrys Hogsmeade meeting so he was not breaking any rules in the Hogs Head at all .Percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy .Fudge remained motionless in midbounce his mouth hanging open .Umbridge recovered first .Thats all very fine Headmaster she said smiling sweetly .But we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twentyfour .If the first meeting was not illegal all those that have happened since most certainly are .Well said Dumbledore surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers they certainly would be if they had continued after the decree came into effect .Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued ?As Dumbledore spoke Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something .He could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side a gentle something like a draft or bird wings but looking down he saw nothing there .Evidence ?repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike smile .Have you not been listening Dumbledore ?Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here ?Oh can she tell us about six months worth of meetings ?said Dumbledore raising his eyebrows .I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight .Miss Edgecombe said Umbridge at once tell us how long these meetings have been going on dear .You can simply nod or shake your head Im sure that wont make the spots worse .Have they been happening regularly over the last six months ?Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach .This was it they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside .Just nod or shake your head dear Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta .Come on now that wont activate the jinx further .Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Mariettas face .Only her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe .Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight but her eyes looked oddly blank .And then to Harrys utter amazement Marietta shook her head .Umbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta .I dont think you understood the question did you dear ?Im asking whether youve been going to these meetings for the past six months ?You have havent you ?Again Marietta shook her head .What do you mean by shaking your head dear ?said Umbridge in a testy voice .I would have thought her meaning was quite clear said Professor McGonagall harshly .There have been no secret meetings for the past six months .Is that correct Miss Edgecombe ?Marietta nodded .But there was a meeting tonight !said Umbridge furiously .There was a meeting Miss Edgecombe you told me about it in the Room of Requirement !And Potter was the leader was he not Potter organized it Potter why are you shaking your head girl ?Well usually when a person shakes their head said McGonagall coldly they mean ‘no .So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans Professor Umbridge seized Marietta pulled her around to face her and began shaking her very hard .A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet his wand raised .Kingsley started forward and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned .I cannot allow you to manhandle my students Dolores said Dumbledore and for the first time he looked angry .You want to calm yourself Madam Umbridge said Kingsley in his deep slow voice .You dont want to get yourself into trouble now .No said Umbridge breathlessly glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley .I mean yes youre right Shacklebolt I I forgot myself .Marietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her .She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridges sudden attack nor relieved by her release .She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes staring straight ahead of her .A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsleys whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into Harrys mind .Dolores said Fudge with the air of trying to settle something once and for all the meeting tonight the one we know definitely happened Yes said Umbridge pulling herself together yes .well Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor accompanied by certain trustworthy students so as to catch those in the meeting redhanded .It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival however because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction .It does not matter however .I have all their names here Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind .We needed evidence and the room provided And to Harrys horror she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirements wall and handed it to Fudge .The moment I saw Potters name on the list I knew what we were dealing with she said softly .Excellent said Fudge a smile spreading across his face .Excellent Dolores .And .by thunder .He looked up at Dumbledore who was still standing beside Marietta his wand held loosely in his hand .See what theyve named themselves ?said Fudge quietly .DumbledoresArmy .Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge .He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak .Then he looked up smiling .Well the game is up he said simply .Would you like a written confession from me Cornelius or will a statement before these witnesses suffice ?Harry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other .There was fear in both faces .He did not understand what was going on and neither apparently did Fudge .Statement ?said Fudge slowly .What I dont ?Dumbledores Army Cornelius said Dumbledore still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudges face .Not Potters Army .Dumbledores Army .But but Understanding blazed suddenly in Fudges face .He took a horrified step backward yelped and jumped out of the fire again .You ?he whispered stamping again on his smoldering cloak .Thats right said Dumbledore pleasantly .You organized this ?I did said Dumbledore .You recruited these students for for your army ?Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting said Dumbledore nodding .Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me .I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe of course .Marietta nodded .Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore his chest swelling .Then you have been plotting against me !he yelled .Thats right said Dumbledore cheerfully .NO !shouted Harry .Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what Dumbledore was about to do and he could not let it happen .No Professor Dumbledore !Be quiet Harry or I am afraid you will have to leave my office said Dumbledore calmly .Yes shut up Potter !barked Fudge who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight .Well well well I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead Instead you get to arrest me said Dumbledore smiling .Its like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon isnt it ?Weasley !cried Fudge now positively quivering with delight Weasley have you written it all down everything hes said his confession have you got it ?Yes sir I think so sir !said Percy eagerly whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his notetaking .The bit about how hes been trying to build up an army against the Ministry how hes been working to destabilize me ?Yes sir Ive got it yes !said Percy scanning his notes joyfully .Very well then said Fudge now radiant with glee .Duplicate your notes Weasley and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once .If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition !Percy dashed from the room slamming the door behind him and Fudge turned back to Dumbledore .You will now be escorted back to the Ministry where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azkaban to await trial !Ah said Dumbledore gently yes .Yes I thought we might hit that little snag .Snag ?said Fudge his voice still vibrating with joy .I see no snag Dumbledore !Well said Dumbledore apologetically Im afraid I do .Oh really ?Well its just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to what is the phrase ? ‘Come quietly .I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all Cornelius .I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban .I could break out of course but what a waste of time and frankly I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing .Umbridges face was growing steadily redder she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water .Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened .He made a small choking noise and then looked around at Kingsley and the man with short gray hair who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far .The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forward a little away from the wall .Harry saw his hand drift almost casually toward his pocket .Dont be silly Dawlish said Dumbledore kindly .Im sure you are an excellent Auror I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Outstanding in all your N .E .W .T .s but if you attempt to er ‘bring me in by force I will have to hurt you .The man called Dawlish blinked looking rather foolish .He looked toward Fudge again but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next .So sneered Fudge recovering himself you intend to take on Dawlish Shacklebolt Dolores and myself singlehanded do you Dumbledore ?Merlins beard no said Dumbledore smiling .Not unless you are foolish enough to force me to .He will not be singlehanded !said Professor McGonagall loudly plunging her hand inside her robes .Oh yes he will Minerva !said Dumbledore sharply .Hogwarts needs you !Enough of this rubbish !said Fudge pulling out his own wand .Dawlish !Shacklebolt !Take him .A streak of silver light flashed around the room .There was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled .A hand grabbed the scruff of Harrys neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off several of the portraits yelled Fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air .Coughing in the dust Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him .There was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried No !Then the sound of breaking glass frantically scuffling footsteps a groan and silence .Harry struggled around to see who was half strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him .She had forced both him and Marietta out of harms way .Dust was still floating gently down through the air onto them .Panting slightly Harry saw a very tall figure moving toward them .Are you all right ?said Dumbledore .Yes !said Professor McGonagall getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her .The dust was clearing .The wreckage of the office loomed into view Dumbledores desk had been overturned all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor their silver instruments in pieces .Fudge Umbridge Kingsley and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor .Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them singing softly .Unfortunately I had to hex Kingsley too or it would have looked very suspicious said Dumbledore in a low voice .He was remarkably quick on the uptake modifying Miss Edgecombes memory like that while everyone was looking the other way thank him for me wont you Minerva ?Now they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate you must act as though no time has passed as though they were merely knocked to the ground they will not remember Where will you go Dumbledore ?whispered Professor McGonagall .Grimmauld Place ?Oh no said Dumbledore with a grim smile .I am not leaving to go into hiding .Fudge will soon wish hed never dislodged me from Hogwarts I promise you .Professor Dumbledore .Harry began .He did not know what to say first how sorry he was that he had started the D .A .in the first place and caused all this trouble or how terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion ?But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word .Listen to me Harry he said urgently you must study Occlumency as hard as you can do you understand me ?Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams you will understand why soon enough but you must promise me The man called Dawlish was stirring .Dumbledore seized Harrys wrist .Remember close your mind But as Dumbledore s fingers closed over Harrys skin a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore to bite him to hurt him you will understand whispered Dumbledore .Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him .Dumbledore released Harry raised his hand and grasped the phoenixs long golden tail .There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone .Where is he ?yelled Fudge pushing himself up from the ground .Where is he ?I dont know !shouted Kingsley also leaping to his feet .Well he cant have Disapparated !cried Umbridge .You cant inside this school The stairs !cried Dawlish and he flung himself upon the door wrenched it open and disappeared followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge .Fudge hesitated then got to his feet slowly brushing dust from his front .There was a long and painful silence .Well Minerva said Fudge nastily straightening his torn shirtsleeve Im afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore .You think so do you ?said Professor McGonagall scornfully .Fudge seemed not to hear her .He was looking around at the wrecked office .A few of the portraits hissed at him one or two even made rude hand gestures .Youd better get those two off to bed said Fudge looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod toward Harry and Marietta .She said nothing but marched Harry and Marietta to the door .As it swung closed behind them Harry heard Phineas Nigelluss voice .You know Minister I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts .but you cannot deny hes got style .SNAPES WORST MEMORY BY ORDER OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Dolores Jane Umbridge High Inquisitor has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .The above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twentyeight .Signed Cornelius Oswald Fudge MINISTER OF MAGIC The notices had gone up all over the school overnight but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors the High Inquisitor the Minister of Magic and his Junior Assistant to escape .No matter where Harry went within the castle next day the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledores flight and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling Harry overheard one secondyear girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St .Mungos with a pumpkin for a head it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was .Everybody seemed aware for instance that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledores office and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand account wherever he went .Dumbledore will be back before long said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to Harrys story .They couldnt keep him away in our second year and they wont be able to this time .The Fat Friar told me .He dropped his voice conspiratorially so that Harry Ron and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear .that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after theyd searched the castle and grounds for him .Couldnt get past the gargoyle .The Heads office has sealed itself against her .Ernie smirked .Apparently she had a right little tantrum .Oh I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Heads office said Hermione viciously as they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall .Lording it over all the other teachers the stupid puffedup powercrazy old Now do you really want to finish that sentence Granger ?Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door followed by Crabbe and Goyle .His pale pointed face was alight with malice .Afraid Im going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff he drawled .Its only teachers that can dock points from Houses Malfoy said Ernie at once .Yeah were prefects too remember ?snarled Ron .I know prefects cant dock points Weasel King sneered Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle sniggered .But members of the Inquisitorial Squad The what ?said Hermione sharply .The Inquisitorial Squad Granger said Malfoy pointing toward a tiny silver I upon his robes just beneath his prefects badge .A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic handpicked by Professor Umbridge .Anyway members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points .So Granger Ill have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress .Macmillan five for contradicting me .Five because I dont like you Potter .Weasley your shirts untucked so Ill have another five for that .Oh yeah I forgot youre a Mudblood Granger so ten for that .Ron pulled out his wand but Hermione pushed it away whispering Dont !Wise move Granger breathed Malfoy .New Head new times .Be good now Potty .Weasel King .He strode away laughing heartily with Crabbe and Goyle .He was bluffing said Ernie looking appalled .He cant be allowed to dock points .that would be ridiculous .It would completely undermine the prefect system .But Harry Ron and Hermione had turned automatically toward the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them which recorded the House points .Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning .Even as they watched stones flew upward reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs .In fact the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emeraldfilled one of Slytherin .Noticed have you ?said Freds voice .He and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry Ron Hermione and Ernie in front of the hourglasses .Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points said Harry furiously as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor hourglass .Yeah Montague tried to do us during break said George .What do you mean ‘tried ?said Ron quickly .He never managed to get all the words out said Fred due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor .Hermione looked very shocked .But youll get into terrible trouble !Not until Montague reappears and that could take weeks I dunno where we sent him said Fred coolly .Anyway .weve decided we dont care about getting into trouble anymore .Have you ever ?asked Hermione .Course we have said George .Never been expelled have we ?Weve always known where to draw the line said Fred .We might have put a toe across it occasionally said George .But weve always stopped short of causing real mayhem said Fred .But now ?said Ron tentatively .Well now said George .what with Dumbledore gone said Fred .we reckon a bit of mayhem said George .is exactly what our dear new Head deserves said Fred .You mustnt !whispered Hermione .You really mustnt !Shed love a reason to expel you !You dont get it Hermione do you ?said Fred smiling at her .We dont care about staying anymore .Wed walk out right now if we werent determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first .So anyway he checked his watch phase one is about to begin .Id get in the Great Hall for lunch if I were you that way the teachers will see you cant have had anything to do with it .Anything to do with what ?said Hermione anxiously .Youll see said George .Run along now .Fred and George turned away and disappeared in the swelling crowd descending the stairs toward lunch .Looking highly disconcerted Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration homework and scurried away .I think we should get out of here you know said Hermione nervously .Just in case .Yeah all right said Ron and the three of them moved toward the doors to the Great Hall but Harry had barely glimpsed todays ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and turning he found himself almost nose to nose with Filch the caretaker .He took several hasty steps backward Filch was best viewed at a distance .The headmistress would like to see you Potter he leered .I didnt do it said Harry stupidly thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning .Filchs jowls wobbled with silent laughter .Guilty conscience eh ?he wheezed .Follow me .Harry glanced back at Ron and Hermione who were both looking worried .He shrugged and followed Filch back into the entrance hall against the tide of hungry students .Filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase .As they reached the first landing he said Things are changing around here Potter .Ive noticed said Harry coldly .Yerse .Ive been telling Dumbledore for years and years hes too soft with you all said Filch chuckling nastily .You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stinkpellets if youd known I had it in my power to whip you raw would you now ?Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I couldve strung you up by the ankles in my office would they ?But when Educational Decree Twentynine comes in Potter Ill be allowed to do them things .And shes asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves .Oh things are going to be very different around here with her in charge .Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side Harry thought and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon his knowledge of the schools secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley twins .Here we are he said leering down at Harry as he rapped three times upon Professor Umbridges door and pushed it open .The Potter boy to see you maam .Umbridges office so very familiar to Harry from his many detentions was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word HEADMISTRESS also his Firebolt and Freds and Georges Cleansweeps which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk .Umbridge was sitting behind the desk busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance .Thank you Argus she said sweetly .Not at all maam not at all said Filch bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit and exiting backward .Sit said Umbridge curtly pointing toward a chair and Harry sat .She continued to scribble for a few moments .He watched some of the foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him .Well now she said finally setting down her quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly .What would you like to drink ?What ?said Harry quite sure he had misheard her .To drink Mr Potter she said smiling still more widely .Tea ?Coffee ?Pumpkin juice ?As she named each drink she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk .Nothing thank you said Harry .I wish you to have a drink with me she said her voice becoming more dangerously sweet .Choose one .Fine .tea then said Harry shrugging .She got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him .She then bustled around the desk with it smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion .There she said handing it to him .Drink it before it gets cold wont you ?Well now Mr Potter .I thought we ought to have a little chat after the distressing events of last night .He said nothing .She settled herself back into her seat and waited .When several long moments had passed in silence she said gaily Youre not drinking up !He raised the cup to his lips and then just as suddenly lowered it .One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like MadEye Moodys magical one and it had just occurred to Harry what MadEye would say if he ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy .Whats the matter ?said Umbridge who was still watching him .Do you want sugar ?No said Harry .He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip though keeping his mouth tightly closed .Umbridges smile widened .Good she whispered .Very good .Now then .She leaned forward a little .Where is Albus Dumbledore ?No idea said Harry promptly .Drink up drink up she said still smiling .Now Mr Potter let us not play childish games .I know that you know where he has gone .You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning .Consider your position Mr Potter .I dont know where he is .Harry pretended to drink again .Very well said Umbridge looking displeased .In that case you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black .Harrys stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer .He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto his robes .I dont know he said a little too quickly .Mr Potter said Umbridge let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October .I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today I promise you .I repeat Mr Potter .Where is Sirius Black ?No idea said Harry loudly .Havent got a clue .They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering .Then she stood up .Very well Potter I will take your word for it this time but be warned The might of the Ministry stands behind me .All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored .A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts except my own of course .My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle .And Mr Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle .If I find a shred of evidence .BOOM !The very floor of the office shook Umbridge slipped sideways clutching her desk for support looking shocked .What was ?She was gazing toward the door Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers .He could hear people running and screaming several floors below .Back to lunch with you Potter !cried Umbridge raising her wand and dashing out of the office .Harry gave her a few seconds start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was .It was not difficult to find .One floor down pandemonium reigned .Somebody and Harry had a very shrewd idea who had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks .Dragons comprised entirely of greenandgold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went .Shocking pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers .Rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls .Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord .Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked and instead of burning themselves out fading from sight or fizzling to a halt these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched .Filch and Umbridge were standing apparently transfixed with horror halfway down the stairs .As Harry watched one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver it whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sinister voheeeeeeeeee .Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds .Meanwhile several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape toward the second floor .Hurry Filch hurry !shrieked Umbridge .Theyll be all over the school unless we do something Stupefy A jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets .Instead of freezing in midair it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppylooking witch in the middle of a meadow she ran for it just in time reappearing seconds later squashed into the painting next door where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her .Dont Stun them Filch !shouted Umbridge angrily for all the world as though it had been his suggestion .Right you are Headmistress !wheezed Filch who was a Squib and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them .He dashed to a nearby cupboard pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze .Harry had seen enough .Laughing he ducked down low ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it listening to Umbridges and Filchs yells and quaking with suppressed mirth .Impressive Harry said quietly grinning .Very impressive .Youll put Dr .Filibuster out of business no problem .Cheers whispered George wiping tears of laughter from his face .Oh I hope she tries Vanishing them next .They multiply by ten every time you try .The fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon .Though they caused plenty of disruption particularly the firecrackers the other teachers did not seem to mind them very much .Dear dear said Professor McGonagall sardonically as one of the dragons soared around her classroom emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame .Miss Brown would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom ?The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her .When the final bell rang and the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags Harry saw with immense satisfaction a disheveled and soot blackened Umbridge tottering sweatyfaced from Professor Flitwicks classroom .Thank you so much Professor !said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice .I could have got rid of the sparklers myself of course but I wasnt sure whether I had the authority .Beaming he closed his classroom door in her snarling face .Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room .Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd around them to congratulate them .They were wonderful fireworks she said admiringly .Thanks said George looking both surprised and pleased .Weasleys Wildfire WhizBangs .Only thing is we used our whole stock were going to have to start again from scratch now .It was worth it though said Fred who was taking orders from clamoring Gryffindors .If you want to add your name to the waiting list Hermione its five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe .Hermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might spring out of it and start doing itself .Oh why dont we have a night off ?said Hermione brightly as a silvertailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window .After all the Easter holidays start on Friday well have plenty of time then .Are you feeling all right ?Ron asked staring at her in disbelief .Now you mention it said Hermione happily dyou know .I think Im feeling a bit .rebellious .Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour later and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower still resolutely spelling out the word POO .He got into bed yawning .With his glasses off the occasional firework still passing the window became blurred looking like sparkling clouds beautiful and mysterious against the black sky .He turned onto his side wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledores job and how Fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption .Smiling to himself he closed his eyes .The whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant .or perhaps he Harry was simply speeding away from them .He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries .He was speeding toward the plain black door .Let it open .Let it open .It did .He was inside the circular room lined with doors .He crossed it placed his hand upon an identical door and it swung inward .Now he was in a long rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking .There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate .He had to go on .There was a door at the far end .It too opened at his touch .And now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves each laden with small dusty spun glass spheres .Now Harrys heart was beating fast with excitement .He knew where to go .He ran forward but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous deserted room .There was something in this room he wanted very very much .Something he wanted .or somebody else wanted .His scar was hurting .BANG !Harry awoke instantly confused and angry .The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter .Cool !said Seamus who was silhouetted against the window .I think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and its like they mated come and see !Harry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look .He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him .He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment .He had got so close that time .Glittering pinkandsilver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower .Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them .His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening .Harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much farther into the Department of Mysteries he had penetrated during his last dream .With a surge of guilt he realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson There had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left .He was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried .He doubted however whether Snape would accept that excuse .He attempted a little lastminute practice during classes that day but it was no good Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and after all the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class .Resigned to the worst he set off for Snape s office after dinner .Halfway across the entrance hall however Cho came hurrying up to him .Over here said Harry glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hourglasses stood .Gryffindors was now almost empty .Are you okay ?Umbridge hasnt been asking you about the D .A .has she ?Oh no said Cho hurriedly .No it was only .Well I just wanted to say .Harry I never dreamed Marietta would tell .Yeah well said Harry moodily .He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully .It was small consolation that the last he had heard Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples .Shes a lovely person really said Cho .She just made a mistake Harry looked at her incredulously .A lovely person who made a mistake ?She sold us all out including you !Well .we all got away didnt we ?said Cho pleadingly .You know her mum works for the Ministry its really difficult for her Rons dad works for the Ministry too !Harry said furiously .And in case you hadnt noticed he hasnt got ‘sneak written across his face That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Grangers said Cho fiercely .She should have told us shed jinxed that list I think it was a brilliant idea said Harry coldly .Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter .Oh yes I forgot of course if it was darling Hermiones idea Dont start crying again said Harry warningly .I wasnt going to !she shouted .Yeah .well .good he said .Ive got enough to cope with at the moment .Go and cope with it then !she said furiously turning on her heel and stalking off .Fuming Harry descended the stairs to Snapes dungeon and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door .Youre late Potter said Snape coldly as Harry closed the door behind him .Snape was standing with his back to Harry removing as usual certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledores Pensieve .He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry .So he said .Have you been practicing ?Yes Harry lied looking carefully at one of the legs of Snapes desk .Well well soon find out wont we ?said Snape smoothly .Wand out Potter .Harry moved into his usual position facing Snape with the desk between them .His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind .On the count of three then said Snape lazily .One two Snapes office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in .Professor Snape sir oh sorry Malfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise .Its all right Draco said Snape lowering his wand .Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions .Harry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid .I didnt know he said leering at Harry who knew his face was burning .He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy or even better to hit him with a good curse .Well Draco what is it ?asked Snape .Its Professor Umbridge sir she needs your help said Malfoy .Theyve found Montague sir .Hes turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor .How did he get in there ?demanded Snape .I dont know sir hes a bit confused .Very well very well Potter said Snape we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead .He turned and swept from his office .Malfoy mouthed Remedial Potions ?at Harry behind Snape s back before following him .Seething Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room .At least he had twenty four more hours in which to practice he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed Remedial Potions .He was at the office door when he saw it a patch of shivering light dancing on the door frame .He stopped looking at it reminded of something .Then he remembered It was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries .He turned around .The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape s desk .The silver white contents were ebbing and swirling within .Snapes thoughts .things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snapes defenses accidentally .Harry gazed at the Pensieve curiosity welling inside him .What was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry ?The silvery lights shivered on the wall .Harry took two steps toward the desk thinking hard .Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him ?Harry looked over his shoulder his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever .How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet ?Would he come straight back to his office afterward or accompany Montague to the hospital wing ?Surely the latter .Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team Snape would want to make sure he was all right .Harry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it gazing into its depths .He hesitated listening then pulled out his wand again .The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent .He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand .The silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast .Harry leaned forward over it and saw that it had become transparent .He was once again looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling .In fact unless he was much mistaken he was looking down upon the Great Hall .His breath was actually fogging the surface of Snapes thoughts .His brain seemed to be in limbo .It would be insane to do the thing that he was so strongly tempted to do .He was trembling .Snape could be back at any moment .but Harry thought of Chos anger of Malfoys jeering face and a reckless daring seized him .He took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface of Snapes thoughts .At once the floor of the office lurched tipping Harry headfirst into the Pensieve .He was falling through cold blackness spinning furiously as he went and then He was standing in the middle of the Great Hall but the four House tables were gone .Instead there were more than a hundred smaller tables all facing the same way at each of which sat a student head bent low scribbling on a roll of parchment .The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment .It was clearly exam time .Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent heads which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light .Harry looked around carefully .Snape had to be here somewhere .This was his memory .And there he was at a table right behind Harry .Harry stared .Snapetheteenager had a stringy pallid look about him like a plant kept in the dark .His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto the table his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled .Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper DEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL So Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen around Harrys own age .His hand was flying across the parchment he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbors and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped .Five more minutes !The voice made Harry jump turning he saw the top of Professor Flitwicks head moving between the desks a short distance away .Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair .very untidy black hair .Harry moved so quickly that had he been solid he would have knocked desks flying .Instead he seemed to slide dreamlike across two aisles and up a third .The back of the blackhaired boys head drew nearer and nearer .He was straightening up now putting down his quill pulling his roll of parchment toward him so as to reread what he had written .Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteenyear old father .Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach It was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes .Jamess eyes were hazel his nose was slightly longer than Harrys and there was no scar on his forehead but they had the same thin face same mouth same eyebrows .Jamess hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harrys did his hands could have been Harrys and Harry could tell that when James stood up they would be within an inch of each others heights .James yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair making it even messier than it had been .Then with a glance toward Professor Flitwick he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him .With another shock of excitement Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbsup .Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease tilting it back on two legs .He was very goodlooking his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither Jamess nor Harrys could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully though he didnt seem to have noticed .And two seats along from this girl Harrys stomach gave another pleasurable squirm was Remus Lupin .He looked rather pale and peaky was the full moon approaching ?and was absorbed in the exam As he reread his answers he scratched his chin with the end of his quill frowning slightly .So that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too .and sure enough Harry spotted him within seconds a small mousyhaired boy with a pointed nose .Wormtail looked anxious he was chewing his fingernails staring down at his paper scuffing the ground with his toes .Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbors paper .Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment then back at James who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment .He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L .E .What did they stand for ?Quills down please !squeaked Professor Flitwick .That means you too Stebbins !Please remain seated while I collect your parchment !Acciol More than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwicks outstretched arms knocking him backward off his feet .Several people laughed .A couple of students at the front desks got up took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him onto his feet again .Thank you .thank you panted Professor Flitwick .Very well everybody youre free to go !Harry looked down at his father who had hastily crossed out the L .E .he had been embellishing jumped to his feet stuffed his quill and the exam question paper into his bag which he slung over his back and stood waiting for Sirius to join him .Harry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away moving between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall still absorbed in his own examination paper .Roundshouldered yet angular he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider his oily hair swinging about his face .A gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius and by planting himself in the midst of this group Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends .Did you like question ten Moony ?asked Sirius as they emerged into the entrance hall .Loved it said Lupin briskly . ‘Give five signs that identify the werewolf .Excellent question .Dyou think you managed to get all the signs ?said James in tones of mock concern .Think I did said Lupin seriously as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds .One Hes sitting on my chair .Two Hes wearing my clothes .Three His names Remus Lupin .Wormtail was the only one who didnt laugh .I got the snout shape the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail he said anxiously but I couldnt think what else How thick are you Wormtail ?said James impatiently .You run round with a werewolf once a month Keep your voice down implored Lupin .Harry looked anxiously behind him again .Snape remained close by still buried in his examination questions but this was Snapes memory and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds he Harry would not be able to follow James any farther .To his intense relief however when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the lake Snape followed still poring over the paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going .By jogging a little ahead of him Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others .Well I thought that paper was a piece of cake he heard Sirius say .Ill be surprised if I dont get Outstanding on it at least .Me too said James .He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch .Where d you get that ?Nicked it said James casually .He started playing with the Snitch allowing it to fly as much as a foot away and seizing it again his reflexes were excellent .Wormtail watched him in awe .They stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry Ron and Hermione had spent a Sunday finishing their homework and threw themselves down on the grass .Harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw to his delight that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadows of a clump of bushes .He was as deeply immersed in the O .W .L .paper as ever which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree .The sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting with shoes and socks off cooling their feet in the water .Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading .Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass looking rather haughty and bored but very handsomely so .James was still playing with the Snitch letting it zoom farther and farther away almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second .Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open .Every time James made a particularly difficult catch Wormtail gasped and applauded .After five minutes of this Harry wondered why James didnt tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself but James seemed to be enjoying the attention .Harry noticed his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the waters edge .Put that away will you ?said Sirius finally as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer .Before Wormtail wets himself from excitement .Wormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned .If it bothers you he said stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket .Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off .Im bored said Sirius .Wish it was full moon .You might said Lupin darkly from behind his book .Weve still got Transfiguration if youre bored you could test me .Here .He held out his book .Sirius snorted .I dont need to look at that rubbish I know it all .Thisll liven you up Padfoot said James quietly .Look who it is .Siriuss head turned .He had become very still like a dog that has scented a rabbit .Excellent he said softly .Snivellus .Harry turned to see what Sirius was looking at .Snape was on his feet again and was stowing the O .W .L .paper in his bag .As he emerged from the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass Sirius and James stood up .Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting Lupin was still staring down at his book though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows .Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face .All right Snivellus ?said James loudly .Snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack Dropping his bag he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted ExpelliarmusV Snape s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him .Sirius let out a bark of laughter .Impedimental he said pointing his wand at Snape who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive toward his own fallen wand .Students all around had turned to watch .Some of them had gotten to their feet and were edging nearer to watch .Some looked apprehensive others entertained .Snape lay panting on the ground .James and Sirius advanced on him wands up James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the waters edge as he went .Wormtail was on his feet now watching hungrily edging around Lupin to get a clearer view .Howd the exam go Snivelly ?said James .I was watching him his nose was touching the parchment said Sirius viciously .Therell be great grease marks all over it they wont be able to read a word .Several people watching laughed Snape was clearly unpopular .Wormtail sniggered shrilly .Snape was trying to get up but the jinx was still operating on him he was struggling as though bound by invisible ropes .You wait he panted staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing .You wait .Wait for what ?said Sirius coolly .Whatre you going to do Snivelly wipe your nose on us ?Snape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes but his wand being ten feet away nothing happened .Wash out your mouth said James coldly .Scourgifyl Pink soap bubbles streamed from Snapes mouth at once the froth was covering his lips making him gag choking him Leave him ALONE !James and Sirius looked around .Jamess free hand jumped to his hair again .It was one of the girls from the lake edge .She had thick dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green almondshaped eyes Harrys eyes .Harrys mother .All right Evans ?said James and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant deeper more mature .Leave him alone Lily repeated .She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike .Whats he done to you ?Well said James appearing to deliberate the point its more the fact that he exists if you know what I mean .Many of the surrounding watchers laughed Sirius and Wormtail included but Lupin still apparently intent on his book didnt and neither did Lily .You think youre funny she said coldly .But youre just an arrogant bullying toerag Potter .Leave him alone .I will if you go out with me Evans said James quickly .Go on .Go out with me and Ill never lay a wand on old Snivelly again .Behind him the Impediment Jinx was wearing off .Snape was beginning to inch toward his fallen wand spitting out soapsuds as he crawled .I wouldnt go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid said Lily .Bad luck Prongs said Sirius briskly turning back to Snape .OY !But too late Snape had directed his wand straight at James there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of Jamess face spattering his robes with blood .James whirled about a second flash of light later Snape was hanging upside down in the air his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants .Many people in the small crowd watching cheered .Sirius James and Wormtail roared with laughter .Lily whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile said Let him down !Certainly said James and he jerked his wand upward .Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground .Disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet wand up but Sirius said Petrificus Totalusl and Snape keeled over again at once rigid as a board .LEAVE HIM ALONE !Lily shouted .She had her own wand out now .James and Sirius eyed it warily .Ah Evans dont make me hex you said James earnestly .Take the curse off him then !James sighed deeply then turned to Snape and muttered the countercurse .There you go he said as Snape struggled to his feet again youre lucky Evans was here Snivellus I dont need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her !Lily blinked .Fine she said coolly .I wont bother in future .And Id wash your pants if I were you Snivellus .Apologize to Evans !James roared at Snape his wand pointed threateningly at him .I dont want you to make him apologize Lily shouted rounding on James .Youre as bad as he is .What ?yelped James .Id NEVER call you a you knowwhat !Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like youve just got off your broomstick showing off with that stupid Snitch walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can Im surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it .You make me SICK .She turned on her heel and hurried away .Evans !James shouted after her Hey EVANS !But she didnt look back .What is it with her ?said James trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him .Reading between the lines Id say she thinks youre a bit conceited mate said Sirius .Right said James who looked furious now right There was another flash of light and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air .Who wants to see me take off Snivellys pants ?But whether James really did take off Snapes pants Harry never found out .A hand had closed tight over his upper arm closed with a pincerlike grip .Wincing Harry looked around to see who had hold of him and saw with a thrill of horror a fully grown adultsized Snape standing right beside him white with rage .Having fun ?Harry felt himself rising into the air .The summers day evaporated around him he was floating upward through icy blackness Snapes hand still tight upon his upper arm .Then with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head over heels in midair his feet hit the stone floor of Snapes dungeon and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snapes desk in the shadowy presentday Potions masters study .So said Snape gripping Harrys arm so tightly Harrys hand was starting to feel numb .So .been enjoying yourself Potter ?Nno .said Harry trying to free his arm .It was scary Snapes lips were shaking his face was white his teeth were bared .Amusing man your father wasnt he ?said Snape shaking Harry so hard that his glasses slipped down his nose .I didnt Snape threw Harry from him with all his might .Harry fell hard onto the dungeon floor .You will not tell anybody what you saw !Snape bellowed .No said Harry getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could .No of course I w Get out get out I dont want to see you in this office ever again !And as Harry hurtled toward the door ajar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head .He wrenched the door open and flew away up the corridor stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and Snape .There he leaned against the wall panting and rubbing his bruised arm .He had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen .What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him and that judging from what he had just seen his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him .CAREER ADVICE But why havent you got Occlumency lessons anymore ?said Hermione frowning .Ive told you Harry muttered .Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now Ive got the basics .So youve stopped having funny dreams ?said Hermione skeptically .Pretty much said Harry not looking at her .Well I dont think Snape should stop until youre absolutely sure you can control them !said Hermione indignantly .Harry I think you should go back to him and ask No said Harry forcefully .Just drop it Hermione okay ?It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione as was her custom had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules for the three of them .Harry and Ron had let her do it it was easier than arguing with her and in any case they might come in useful .Ron had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left until their exams .How can that come as a shock ?Hermione demanded as she tapped each little square on Rons schedule with her wand so that it flashed a different color according to its subject .I dunno .said Ron theres been a lot going on .Well there you are she said handing him his schedule if you follow that you should do fine .Ron looked down it gloomily but then brightened .Youve given me an evening off every week !Thats for Quidditch practice said Hermione .The smile faded from Rons face .Whats the point ?he said .Weve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dads got of becoming Minister of Magic .Hermione said nothing .She was looking at Harry who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand trying to get his ears scratched .Whats wrong Harry ?What ?he said quickly .Nothing .He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index .Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermiones chair .I saw Cho earlier said Hermione tentatively and she looked really miserable too .Have you two had a row again ?Wha oh yeah we have said Harry seizing gratefully on the excuse .What about ?That sneak friend of hers Marietta said Harry .Yeah well I dont blame you !said Ron angrily setting down his study schedule .If it hadnt been for her .Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe which Harry found helpful .All he had to do was look angry nod and say yeah and thats right whenever Ron drew breath leaving his mind free to dwell ever more miserably on what he had seen in the Pensieve .He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside .He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snapes aspersions on his fathers character .Hadnt people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been ?Yeah well look what Sirius was like himself said a nagging voice inside Harrys head .He was as bad wasnt he ?Yes he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it .not unless they really loathed them .Perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it .Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at Jamess hands but hadnt Lily asked Whats he done to you ?And hadnt James replied Its more the fact that he exists if you know what I mean ?Hadnt James started it all simply because Sirius said he was bored ?Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius .But in the Pensieve he had sat there and let it all happen .Harry reminded himself that Lily had intervened his mother had been decent yet the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else .She had clearly loathed James and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married .Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it .For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort of inspiration .Whenever someone had told him he was like James he had glowed with pride inside .And now .now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him .The weather grew breezier brighter and warmer as the holidays passed but Harry was stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh years who were all trapped inside traipsing back and forth to the library .Harry pretended that his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves his excuse went unchallenged .Harry Im talking to you can you hear me ?Huh ?He looked around .Ginny Weasley looking very windswept had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone .It was late on Sunday evening Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes Ron had Quidditch practice .Oh hi said Harry pulling his books back toward him .How come youre not at practice ?Its over said Ginny .Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing .Why ?Well were not sure but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat .She sighed heavily .Anyway .a package just arrived its only just got through Umbridges new screening process .She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped and there was a scribbled note across it in red ink reading INSPECTED AND PASSED BY THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR .Its Easter eggs from Mum said Ginny .Theres one for you .There you go .She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small iced Snitches and according to the packaging containing a bag of Fizzing Whizbees .Harry looked at it for a moment then to his horror felt a hard lump rise in his throat .Are you okay Harry ?asked Ginny quietly .Yeah Im fine said Harry gruffly .The lump in his throat was painful .He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this .You seem really down lately Ginny persisted .You know Im sure if you just talked to Cho .Its not Cho I want to talk to said Harry brusquely .Who is it then ?asked Ginny .He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening Madam Pince was several shelves away stamping out a pile of books for a franticlooking Hannah Abbott .I wish I could talk to Sirius he muttered .But I know I cant .More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any Harry unwrapped his Easter egg broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth .Well said Ginny slowly helping herself to a bit of egg too if you really want to talk to Sirius I expect we could think of a way to do it .Come on said Harry hopelessly .With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail ?The thing about growing up with Fred and George said Ginny thoughtfully is that you sort of start thinking anythings possible if youve got enough nerve .Harry looked at her .Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week but he felt a bit more hopeful .WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING ?Oh damn whispered Ginny jumping to her feet .I forgot Madam Pince was swooping down upon them her shriveled face contorted with rage .Chocolate in the library she screamed .Out out OUT !And whipping out her wand she caused Harrys books bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran .As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations a batch of pamphlets leaflets and notices concerning various Wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays along with yet another notice on the board which read CAREER ADVICE All fifth years will be required to attend a short meeting with their Head of House during the first week of the Summer term in which they will be given the opportunity to discuss their future careers .Times of individual appointments are listed below .Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagalls office at halfpast two on Monday which would mean missing most of Divination .He and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the career information that had been left there for their perusal .Well I dont fancy Healing said Ron on the last evening of the holidays .He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed boneandwand emblem of St .Mungos on its front .It says here you need at least an E at N .E .W .T .level in Potions Herbology Transfiguration Charms and Defense Against the Dark Arts .I mean .blimey .Dont want much do they ?Well its a very responsible job isnt it ?said Hermione absently .She was poring over a bright pinkandorange leaflet that was headed SO YOU THINK YOUD LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS ?You dont seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles .All they want is an O .W .L .in Muggle Studies . ‘Much more important is your enthusiasm patience and a good sense offunV Youd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle said Harry darkly .Good sense of when to duck more like .He was halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking .Listen to this ‘Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel adventure and substantial dangerrelated treasure bonuses ?Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank who are currently recruiting Curse Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad .They want Arithmancy though .You could do it Hermione !I dont much fancy banking said Hermione vaguely now immersed in HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS ?Hey said a voice in Harrys ear .He looked around Fred and George had come to join them .Ginnys had a word with us about you said Fred stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off onto the floor .She says you need to talk to Sirius ?What ?said Hermione sharply freezing with her hand halfway toward picking up MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES .Yeah .said Harry trying to sound casual yeah I thought Id like Dont be so ridiculous said Hermione straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes .With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls ?Well we think we can find a way around that said George stretching and smiling .Its a simple matter of causing a diversion .Now you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays ?What was the point we asked ourselves of disrupting leisure time ?continued Fred .No point at all we answered ourselves .And of course wed have messed up peoples studying too which would be the very last thing wed want to do .He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod .She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness .But its business as usual from tomorrow Fred continued briskly .And if were going to be causing a bit of uproar why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius ?Yes but still said Hermione with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse even if you do cause a diversion how is Harry supposed to talk to him ?Umbridges office said Harry quietly .He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no alternative Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own .Are you insane ?said Hermione in a hushed voice .Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade and was watching the conversation warily .I dont think so said Harry shrugging .And how are you going to get in there in the first place ?Harry was ready for this question .Siriuss knife he said .Excuse me ?Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife thatll open any lock said Harry .So even if shes bewitched the door so Alohomora wont work which I bet she has What do you think about this ?Hermione demanded of Ron and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harrys first dinner in Grimmauld Place .I dunno said Ron looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion .If Harry wants to do it its up to him isnt it ?Spoken like a true friend and Weasley said Fred clapping Ron hard on the back .Right then .Were thinking of doing it tomorrow just after lessons because it should cause maximum impact if everybodys in the corridors Harry well set it off in the east wing somewhere draw her right away from her own office I reckon we should be able to guarantee you what twenty minutes ?he said looking at George .Easy said George .What sort of diversion is it ?asked Ron .Youll see little bro said Fred as he and George got up again .At least you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmys corridor round about five oclock tomorrow .Harry awoke very early the next day feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his hearing at the Ministry of Magic .It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridges office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous though that was certainly bad enough today also happened to be the first time he would be in close proximity with Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office as they had Potions that day .After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Nevilles bed staring out on a truly glorious morning .The sky was a clear misty opalescent blue .Directly ahead of him Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape .He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve but he was desperate to hear Siriuss own account of what had happened to know of any mitigating factors there might have been any excuse at all for his fathers behavior .Something caught Harrys attention movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest .Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees .He seemed to be limping .As Harry watched Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it .Harry watched the cabin for several minutes .Hagrid did not emerge again but smoke furled from the chimney so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire .Harry turned away from the window headed back to his trunk and started to dress .With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridges office ahead Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one but he had not reckoned on Hermiones almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five oclock .For the first time ever she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore . .and if she does catch you there apart from being expelled shell be able to guess youve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect shell force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions .Hermione said Ron in a low and indignant voice are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns or am I going to have to take notes instead ?You take notes for a change it wont kill you !By the time they reached the dungeons neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione any longer .Undeterred she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks .Snape meanwhile seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible .Harry was of course well used to this tactic as it was one of Uncle Vernons favorites and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse .In fact compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks he found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily .At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask corked it and took it up to Snapes desk for marking feeling that he might at last have scraped an E .He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter .Harry whipped around again .His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure .Whoops he said softly .Another zero then Potter Harry was too incensed to speak .He strode back to his cauldron intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished .Im sorry !said Hermione with her hands over her mouth .Im really sorry Harry I thought youd finished so I cleared up !Harry could not bring himself to answer .When the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridges office again .He was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his career appointment with Professor McGonagall remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasnt in her office .He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath only a few minutes late .Sorry Professor he panted as he closed the door .I forgot .No matter Potter she said briskly but as she spoke somebody else sniffed from the corner .Harry looked around .Professor Umbridge was sitting there a clipboard on her knee a fussy little piefrill around her neck and a small horribly smug smile on her face .Sit down Potter said Professor McGonagall tersely .Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk .Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard .Well Potter this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into sixth and seventh years said Professor McGonagall .Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts ?Er said Harry .He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting .Yes ?Professor McGonagall prompted Harry .Well I thought of maybe being an Auror Harry mumbled .Youd need top grades for that said Professor McGonagall extracting a small dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it .They ask for a minimum of five N .E .W .T .s and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations grade I see .Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office .Its a difficult career path Potter they only take the best .In fact I dont think anybody has been taken on in the last three years .At this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it .Professor McGonagall ignored her .Youll want to know which subjects you ought to take I suppose ?she went on talking a little more loudly than before .Yes said Harry .Defense Against the Dark Arts I suppose ?Naturally said Professor McGonagall crisply .I would also advise Professor Umbridge gave another cough a little more audible this time .Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment opened them again and continued as though nothing had happened .I would also advise Transfiguration because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work .And I ought to tell you now Potter that I do not accept students into my N .E .W .T .classes unless they have achieved ‘Exceeds Expectations or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level .Id say youre averaging ‘Acceptable at the moment so youll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing .Then you ought to do Charms always useful and Potions .Yes Potter Potions she added with the merest flicker of a smile .Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors .And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding in their O .W .L .s so Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet .May I offer you a cough drop Dolores ?Professor McGonagall asked curtly without looking at Professor Umbridge .Oh no thank you very much said Umbridge with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much .I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption Minerva ?I daresay you 11 find you can said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth .I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror ?said Professor Umbridge sweetly .Were you ?said Professor McGonagall haughtily .Well Potter she continued as though there had been no interruption if you are serious in this ambition I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch .I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable and ‘Exceeds Expectations for the last two years so your Charm work seems satisfactory as for Defense Against the Dark Arts your marks have been generally high Professor Lupin in particular thought you are you quite sure you wouldnt like a cough drop Dolores ?Oh no need thank you Minerva simpered Professor Umbridge who had just coughed her loudest yet .I was just concerned that you might not have Harrys most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you .Im quite sure I slipped in a note .What this thing ?said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harrys folder .She glanced down it her eyebrows slightly raised then placed it back into the folder without comment .Yes as I was saying Potter Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject and obviously for an Auror Did you not understand my note Minerva ?asked Professor Umbridge in honeyed tones quite forgetting to cough .Of course I understood it said Professor McGonagall her teeth clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled .Well then I am confused .Im afraid I dont quite understand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that False hope ?repeated Professor McGonagall still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge .He has achieved high marks in all his Defense Against the Dark Arts tests Im terribly sorry to have to contradict you Minerva but as you will see from my note Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me I should have made my meaning plainer said Professor McGonagall turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes .He has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher .Professor Umbridges smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing .She sat back in her chair turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed her bulging eyes rolling from side to side .Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry her thin nostrils flared her eyes burning .Any questions Potter ?Yes said Harry .What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you if you get enough N .E .W .T .s ?Well youll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth said Professor McGonagall perseverance and dedication because Auror training takes a further three years not to mention very high skills in practical defense .It will mean a lot more study even after youve left school so unless youre prepared to I think youll also find said Umbridge her voice very cold now that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors .Their criminal records .unless youre prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts you should really look at another which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school .A very good chance then said Professor McGonagall .Potter has a criminal record said Umbridge loudly .Potter has been cleared of all charges said Professor McGonagall even more loudly .Professor Umbridge stood up .She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference but her fussy simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made her broad flabby face look oddly sinister .Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror !Professor McGonagall got to her feet too and in her case this was a much more impressive move .She towered over Professor Umbridge .Potter she said in ringing tones I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do !If I have to coach you nightly I will make sure you achieve the required results !The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter !said Umbridge her voice rising furiously .There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is ready to join !shouted Professor McGonagall .Aha !shrieked Professor Umbridge pointing a stubby finger at McGonagall .Yes !Yes yes yes !Of course !Thats what you want isnt it Minerva McGonagall ?You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore !You think youll be where I am dont you Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot !You are raving said Professor McGonagall superbly disdainful .Potter that concludes our career consultation .Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room not daring to look at Umbridge .He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor .Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon .I hope youve thought better of what you were planning to do Harry Hermione whispered the moment they had opened their books to chapter thirty four NonRetaliation and Negotiation .Umbridge looks like shes in a really bad mood already .Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry who kept his head down staring at Defensive Magical Theory his eyes unfocused thinking .He could just imagine Professor McGonagalls reaction if he were caught trespassing in Professor Umbridges office mere hours after she had vouched for him .There was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve .Nothing except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach .And then there was the matter of Fred and George whose diversion was already planned not to mention the knife Sirius had given him which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his fathers old Invisibility Cloak .But the fact remained that if he were caught .Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school Harry !whispered Hermione raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge .And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing !He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summers day more than twenty years ago .And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room .You re less like your father than I thought .The risk wouldve been what made it fun for James .But did he want to be like his father anymore ?Harry dont do it please dont do it !Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class .He did not answer he did not know what to do .Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice .He would not look at Harry though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more he said in a low voice Give it a rest okay ?He can make up his own mind .Harrys heart beat very fast as he left the classroom .He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance .There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them .People exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully Then Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her .Pulling out her wand she hurried off in the opposite direction It was now or never .Harry please !said Hermione weakly .But he had made up his mind hitching his bag more securely onto his shoulder he set off at a run weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction off to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing .Harry reached the corridor where Umbridges office was situated and found it deserted .Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him he pulled open his bag seized Siriuss knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak .He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until he reached Umbridges door .He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down then withdrew it .There was a tiny click and the door swung open .He ducked inside the office closed the door quickly behind him and looked around .It was empty nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated broomsticks .Harry pulled off his cloak and striding over to the fireplace found what he was looking for within seconds a small box containing glittering Floo powder .He crouched down in front of the empty grate his hands shaking .He had never done this before though he thought he knew how it must work .Sticking his head into the fireplace he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him .They exploded at once into emeraldgreen flames .Number twelve Grimmauld Place !Harry said loudly and clearly .It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced he had traveled by Floo powder before of course but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country This time his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridges office and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire .And then abruptly as it had begun the spinning stopped .Feeling rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long wooden table where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment .Sirius ?The man jumped and looked around .It was not Sirius but Lupin .Harry !he said looking thoroughly shocked .What are you whats happened is everything all right ?Yeah said Harry .I just wondered I mean I just fancied a a chat with Sirius .Ill call him said Lupin getting to his feet still looking perplexed .He went upstairs to look for Kreacher he seems to be hiding in the attic again .And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen .Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs .He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridges hard stone floor .Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later .What is it ?said Sirius urgently sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire so that he and Harry were on a level Lupin knelt down too looking very concerned .Are you all right ?Do you need help ?No said Harry its nothing like that .I just wanted to talk .about my dad .They exchanged a look of great surprise but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed that five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion George had only guaranteed him twenty .He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve .When he had finished neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment .Then Lupin said quietly I wouldnt like you to judge your father on what you saw there Harry .He was only fifteen Im fifteen !said Harry heatedly .Look Harry said Sirius placatingly James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other it was just one of those things you can understand that cant you ?I think James was everything Snape wanted to be he was popular he was good at Quidditch good at pretty much everything .And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James whatever else he may have appeared to you Harry always hated the Dark Arts .Yeah said Harry but he just attacked Snape for no good reason just because well just because you said you were bored he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice .Im not proud of it said Sirius quickly .Lupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said Look Harry what youve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did everyone thought they were the height of cool if they sometimes got a bit carried away If we were sometimes arrogant little berks you mean said Sirius .Lupin smiled .He kept messing up his hair said Harry in a pained voice .Sirius and Lupin laughed .Id forgotten he used to do that said Sirius affectionately .Was he playing with the Snitch ?said Lupin eagerly .Yeah said Harry watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently .Well .I thought he was a bit of an idiot .Of course he was a bit of an idiot !said Sirius bracingly .We were all idiots !Well not Moony so much he said fairly looking at Lupin but Lupin shook his head .Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape ?he said .Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order ?Yeah well said Sirius you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes .That was something .And said Harry doggedly determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here he kept looking over at the girls by the lake hoping they were watching him !Oh well he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around said Sirius shrugging .He couldnt stop himself showing off whenever he got near her .How come she married him ?Harry asked miserably .She hated him !Nah she didnt said Sirius .She started going out with him in seventh year said Lupin .Once James had deflated his head a bit said Sirius .And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it said Lupin .Even Snape ?said Harry .Well said Lupin slowly Snape was a special case .I mean he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldnt really expect James to take that lying down could you ?And my mum was okay with that ?She didnt know too much about it to tell you the truth said Sirius .I mean James didnt take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her did he ?Sirius frowned at Harry who was still looking unconvinced .Look he said your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person .A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen .He grew out of it .Yeah okay said Harry heavily .I just never thought Id feel sorry for Snape .Now you mention it said Lupin a faint crease between his eyebrows how did Snape react when he found youd seen all this ?He told me hed never teach me Occlumency again said Harry indifferently like thats a big disappoint He WHAT ?shouted Sirius causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes .Are you serious Harry ?said Lupin quickly .Hes stopped giving you lessons ?Yeah said Harry surprised at what he considered a great overreaction .But its okay I dont care its a bit of a relief to tell you the Im coming up there to have a word with Snape !said Sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up but Lupin wrenched him back down again .If anyones going to tell Snape it will be me !he said firmly .But Harry first of all youre to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons when Dumbledore hears I cant tell him that hed kill me !said Harry outraged .You didnt see him when we got out of the Pensieve Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency !said Lupin sternly .Do you understand me ?Nothing !Okay okay said Harry thoroughly discomposed not to mention annoyed .Ill .Ill try and say something to him .But it wont be .He fell silent .He could hear distant footsteps .Is that Kreacher coming downstairs ?No said Sirius glancing behind him .It must be somebody your end .Harrys heart skipped several beats .Id better go !he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out of Grimmauld Places fire .For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders and then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridges fire with his head firmly back on watching the emerald flames flicker and die .Quickly quickly !he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door .Ah shes left it open .Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office .He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room pulled open a drawer in Umbridges desk and began rifling through the papers inside it .Approval for Whipping .Approval for Whipping .I can do it at last .Theyve had it coming to them for years .He pulled out a piece of parchment kissed it then shuffled rapidly back out of the door clutching it to his chest .Harry leapt to his feet and making sure that he had his bag and the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go .One landing down from Umbridges office and Harry thought it was safe to become visible again he pulled off the cloak shoved it in his bag and hurried onward .There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall .He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there .It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked .Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring some of them Harry noticed covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd .Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves and Peeves who was bobbing overhead gazed down upon Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered .So !said Umbridge triumphantly whom Harry realized was standing just a few stairs in front of him once more looking down upon her prey .So .you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp do you ?Pretty amusing yeah said Fred looking back up at her without the slightest sign of fear .Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge almost crying with happiness .Ive got the form Headmistress he said hoarsely waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk .Ive got the form and Ive got the whips waiting .Oh let me do it now .Very good Argus she said .You two she went on gazing down at Fred and George are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school .You know what ?said Fred .I dont think we are .He turned to his twin .George said Fred I think weve outgrown fulltime education .Yeah Ive been feeling that way myself said George lightly .Time to test our talents in the real world dyou reckon ?asked Fred .Definitely said George .And before Umbridge could say a word they raised their wands and said together Accio BroomsV Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance .Looking to his left he ducked just in time Fred and Georges broomsticks one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall were hurtling along the corridor toward their owners .They turned left streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor .We wont be seeing you Fred told Professor Umbridge swinging his leg over his broomstick .Yeah dont bother to keep in touch said George mounting his own .Fred looked around at the assembled students and at the silent watchful crowd .If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp as demonstrated upstairs come to number ninetythree Diagon Alley Weasleys Wizarding Wheezes he said in a loud voice .Our new premises !Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear theyre going to use our products to get rid of this old bat added George pointing at Professor Umbridge .STOP THEM !shrieked Umbridge but it was too late .As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in Fred and George kicked off from the floor shooting fifteen feet into the air the iron peg swinging dangerously below .Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd .Give her hell from us Peeves .And Peeves whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset .GRAWP The story of Fred and Georges flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend .Within a week even those who had been eyewitnesses were half convinced that they had seen the twins divebomb Umbridge on their brooms pelting her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors .In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like Honestly some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place or else One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley .Fred and George had made sure that nobody was likely to forget them very soon .For one thing they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing .Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success .Eventually the area was roped off and Filch gnashing his teeth furiously was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms .Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but just as in the case of Fred and Georges Wildfire Whiz Bangs they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle .Then there were the two large broomshaped holes in Umbridge s office door through which Fred and Georges Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters .Filch fitted a new door and removed Harrys Firebolt to the dungeons where it was rumored Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it .However her troubles were far from over .Inspired by Fred and Georges example a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of TroublemakersinChief .In spite of the new door somebody managed to slip a hairy snouted niffler into Umbridge s office which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects leapt on Umbridge on her reentrance and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers .Dungbombs and Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform BubbleHead Charms on themselves before leaving lessons which ensured them a supply of fresh clean air even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upsidedown goldfish bowls on their heads .Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands desperate to catch miscreants but the problem was that there were now so many of them that he did not know which way to turn .The Inquisitorial Squad were attempting to help him but odd things kept happening to its members .Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes .Pansy Parkinson to Hermiones delight missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers .Meanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts .Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint vomit develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils .Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering Umbridgeitis .After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding swooning sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves .But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos Peeves who seemed to have taken Freds parting words deeply to heart .Cackling madly he soared through the school upending tables bursting out of blackboards and toppling statues and vases .Twice he shut Mrs Norris inside suits of armor from which she was rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker .He smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and whenever he fancied a break spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke .None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her .Indeed a week after Fred and Georges departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth It unscrews the other way .To cap matters Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet .He remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive looking extremely angry .Should we say something ?said Hermione in a worried voice pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr and Mrs Montague marching inside .About what happened to him ?In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him ?Course not hell recover said Ron indifferently .Anyway more trouble for Umbridge isnt it ?said Harry in a satisfied voice .He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands .Harrys spouted four very short legs that would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair .Rons grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty trembled for a few seconds then folded causing the cup to crack into two .Reparo said Hermione quickly mending Rons cup with a wave of her wand .Thats all very well but what if Montagues permanently injured ?Who cares ?said Ron irritably while his teacup stood drunkenly again trembling violently at the knees .Montague shouldnt have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor should he ?If you want to worry about anyone Hermione worry about me !You ?she said catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willowpatterned legs and replacing it in front of her .Why should I be worried about you ?When Mums next letter finally gets through Umbridges screening process said Ron bitterly now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight Im going to be in deep trouble .I wouldnt be surprised if shes sent a Howler again .But Itll be my fault Fred and George left you wait said Ron darkly .Shell say I shouldve stopped them leaving I shouldve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something .Yeah itll be all my fault .Well if she does say that itll be very unfair you couldnt have done anything !But Im sure she wont I mean if its really true theyve got premises in Diagon Alley now they must have been planning this for ages .Yeah but thats another thing how did they get premises ?said Ron hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him .Its a bit dodgy isnt it ?Theyll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley shell want to know what theyve been up to to get their hands on that sort of gold .Well yes that occurred to me too said Hermione allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harrys whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop .Ive been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful .He hasnt said Harry curtly .How do you know ?said Ron and Hermione together .Because Harry hesitated but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come .There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals .Because they got the gold from me .I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June .There was a shocked silence then Hermiones teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor .Oh Harry you didnt she said .Yes I did said Harry mutinously .And I dont regret it either I didnt need the gold and theyll be great at a joke shop .But this is excellent !said Ron looking thrilled .Its all your fault Harry Mum cant blame me at all !Can I tell her ?Yeah I suppose youd better said Harry dully .Specially if she thinks theyre receiving stolen cauldrons or something .Hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self restraint was bound to crack before long .Sure enough once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air .Harry interrupted her before she had even started .Its no good nagging me its done he said firmly .Fred and George have got the gold spent a good bit of it too by the sounds of it and I cant get it back from them and I dont want to .So save your breath Hermione .I wasnt going to say anything about Fred and George !she said in an injured voice .Ron snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look .No I wasnt !she said angrily .As a matter of fact I was going to ask Harry when hes going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again !Harrys heart sank .Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and Georges dramatic departure which admittedly had taken many hours Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius .As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place it had been hard to think of things to tell them .He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons .He had been regretting this ever since Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it .You cant tell me youve stopped having funny dreams Hermione said now because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again .Harry threw Ron a furious look .Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself .You were only muttering a bit he mumbled apologetically .Something about ‘just a bit farther .I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch Harry lied brutally .I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the Quaffle .Rons ears went red .Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure He had not of course dreamed anything of the sort .Last night he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor .He had passed through the circular room then the room full of clicking and dancing light until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres .He had hurried straight toward row number ninety seven turned left and ran along it .It had probably been then that he had spoken aloud .Just a bit farther .for he could feel his conscious self struggling to wake .and before he had reached the end of the row he had found himself lying in bed again gazing up at the canopy of his fourposter .You are trying to block your mind arent you ?said Hermione looking beadily at Harry .You are keeping going with your Occlumency ?Of course I am said Harry trying to sound as though this question was insulting but not quite meeting her eye .The truth was that he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue .The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to studying his mind seemed saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all .When he did his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams .He also suspected that part of his mind the part that often spoke in Hermiones voice now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door and sought to wake him before he could reach journeys end .You know said Ron whose ears were still flaming red if Montague doesnt recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup .Yeah I spose so said Harry glad of a change of subject .I mean weve won one lost one if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday Yeah thats right said Harry losing track of what he was agreeing to Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard determinedly not looking at him .The final match of the Quidditch season Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw was to take place on the last weekend of May .Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory due mainly though of course nobody said it to him to Rons abysmal goalkeeping record .He however seemed to have found a new optimism .I mean I cant get any worse can I ?he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match .Nothing to lose now is there ?You know said Hermione as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around .They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence .Luna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head .Oh gosh I forgot !said Hermione watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins .Cho will be playing wont she ?Harry who had not forgotten this merely grunted .They found seats in the topmost row of the stands .It was a fine clear day .Ron could not wish for better and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of Weasley Is Our King .Lee Jordan who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left was commentating as usual .As the teams zoomed out onto the pitches he named the players with something less than his usual gusto . .Bradley .Davies .Chang he said and Harry felt his stomach perform less of a back flip more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out onto the pitch her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze .He was not sure what he wanted to happen anymore except that he could not stand any more rows .Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy .And theyre off !said Lee .And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle he dodges Johnson he dodges Bell he dodges Spinnet as well .Hes going straight for goal !Hes going to shoot and and Lee swore very loudly .And hes scored .Harry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors .Predictably horribly the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing Weasley cannot save a thing He cannot block a single ring .Harry said a hoarse voice in Harrys ear .Hermione Harry looked around and saw Hagrids enormous bearded face sticking between the seats apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind for the first and second years he had just passed had a ruffled flattened look about them .For some reason Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else .Listen he whispered can yeh come with me ?Now ?While evryones watchin the match ?Er .cant it wait Hagrid ?asked Harry .Till the match is over ?No said Hagrid .No Harry its gotta be now .while evryones lookin the other way .Please ?Hagrids nose was gently dripping blood .His eyes were both blackened .Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the school he looked utterly woebegone .Course said Harry at once course well come .He and Hermione edged back along their row of seats causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them .The people in Hagrids row were not complaining merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible .I ppreciate this you two I really do said Hagrid as they reached the stairs .He kept looking around nervously as they descended toward the lawn below .I jus hope she doesn notice us goin .You mean Umbridge ?said Harry .She wont shes got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her didnt you see ?She must be expecting trouble at the match .Yeah well a bit o trouble wouldn hurt said Hagrid pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted .Give us more time .What is it Hagrid ?said Hermione looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest .Yeh yehll see in a mo said Hagrid looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them .Hey did someone jus score ?Itll be Ravenclaw said Harry heavily .Good .good .said Hagrid distractedly .Thas good .They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn looking around with every other step .When they reached his cabin Hermione turned automatically left toward the front door Hagrid however walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree .When he realized they were no longer with him he turned .Were goin in here he said jerking his shaggy head behind him .Into the forest ?said Hermione perplexed .Yeah said Hagrid .Cmon now quick before were spotted !Harry and Hermione looked at each other then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid who was already striding away from them into the green gloom his crossbow over his arm .Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him .Hagrid why are you armed ?said Harry .Jus a precaution said Hagrid shrugging his massive shoulders .You didnt bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals said Hermione timidly .Nah well we weren goin in so far then said Hagrid .An anyway tha was before Firenze left the forest wasn it ?Why does Firenze leaving make a difference ?asked Hermione curiously .Cause the other centaurs are good an riled at me thas why said Hagrid quietly glancing around .They used ter be well yeh couldn call em friendly but we got on all righ .Kept emselves to emselves bu always turned up if I wanted a word .Not anymore He sighed deeply .Firenze said that theyre angry because he went to work for Dumbledore ?Harry asked tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid s profile .Yeah said Hagrid heavily .Well angry doesn cover it .Ruddy livid .If I hadn stepped in I reckon theyd ve kicked Firenze ter death They attacked him ?said Hermione sounding shocked .Yep said Hagrid gruffly forcing his way through several lowhanging branches .He had half the herd onto him And you stopped it ?said Harry amazed and impressed .By yourself ?Course I did couldnt stand by an watch em kill him could I ?said Hagrid .Lucky I was passin really .an Idve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha before he started sendin me stupid warnins !he added hotly and unexpectedly .Harry and Hermione looked at each other startled but Hagrid scowling did not elaborate .Anyway he said breathing a little more heavily than usual since then the other centaurs Ve bin livid with me an the trouble is theyve got a lot of influence in the forest .Cleverest creatures in here Is that why were here Hagrid ?asked Hermione .The centaurs ?Ah no said Hagrid shaking his head dismissively no its not them .Well o course they could complicate the problem yeah .But yehll see what I mean in a bit .On this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead taking one stride for every three of theirs so that they had great trouble keeping up with him .The path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked farther and farther into the forest that it was as dark as dusk .They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest .Hagrid ?said Harry fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles over which Hagrid had stepped easily and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasions he had stepped off the forest path .Where are we going ?Bit further said Hagrid over his shoulder .Cmon Harry .We need ter keep together now .It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as though they were cobwebs but which snagged Harry and Hermiones robes frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves .Harrys arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches .They were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him .Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence .The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit .It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him as rather ominous .Hagrid would it be all right if we lit our wands ?said Hermione quietly .Er .all righ Hagrid whispered back .In fact .He stopped suddenly and turned around Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backward .Harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor .Maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen so I can .fill yeh in said Hagrid .Before we ge there like .Good !said Hermione as Harry set her back on her feet .They both murmured Lumos and their wand tips ignited .Hagrid s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again .Righ said Hagrid .Well .see .the thing is .He took a great breath .Well theres a good chance Im goin ter be gettin the sack any day now he said .Harry and Hermione looked at each other then back at him .But youve lasted this long Hermione said tentatively .What makes you think Umbridge reckons it was me that put tha niffler in her office .And was it ?said Harry before he could stop himself .No it ruddy well wasn !said Hagrid indignantly .Ony anythin ter do with magical creatures an she thinks its got somethin ter do with me .Yeh know shes bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back .I don wan ter go o course but if it wasn fer .well .the special circumstances Im abou ter explain to yeh Id leave righ now before shes go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school like she did with Trelawney .Harry and Hermione both made noises of protest but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands .Its not the end o the world Ill be able ter help Dumbledore once Im outta here I can be useful ter the Order .An you lotll have GrubblyPlank yehll yehll get through yer exams fine .His voice trembled and broke .Don worry abou me he said hastily as Hermione made to pat his arm .He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it .Look I wouldn be tellin yer this at all if I didn have ter .See if I go .well I can leave withou .withou fellin someone .because Ill Ill need you two ter help me .An Ron if hes willin .Of course well help you said Harry at once .What do you want us to do ?Hagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that Harry was knocked sideways into a tree .I knew yehd say yes said Hagrid into his handkerchief but I won .never .forget .Well .cmon .jus a little bit further through here .Watch yerselves now theres nettles .They walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes .Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop .Really easy he said softly .Very quiet now .They crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought with a jolt of dread was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal .Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade behind which Harry Hermione and Hagrid now stood .Sleepin breathed Hagrid .Sure enough Harry could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work .He glanced sideways at Hermione who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open .She looked utterly terrified .Hagrid she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature who is he ?Harry found this an odd question .What is it ?was the one he had been planning on asking .Hagrid you told us said Hermione her wand now shaking in her hand you told us none of them wanted to come !Harry looked from her to Hagrid and then as realization hit him he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror .The great mound of earth on which he Hermione and Hagrid could easily have stood was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep grunting breathing .It was not a mound at all .It was the curved back of what was clearly .Well no he didn want ter come said Hagrid sounding desperate .But I had ter bring him Hermione I had ter !But why ?asked Hermione who sounded as though she wanted to cry .Why what oh Hagrid I knew if I jus got him back said Hagrid sounding close to tears himself an an taught him a few manners Id be able ter take him outside an show evryone hes harmless !Harmless !said Hermione shrilly and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep .Hes been hurting you all this time hasnt he ?Thats why youve had all these injuries !He don know his own strength !said Hagrid earnestly .An hes gettin better hes not fightin so much anymore So this is why it took you two months to get home !said Hermione distractedly .Oh Hagrid why did you bring him back if he didnt want to come wouldnt he have been happier with his own people ?They were all bullyin him Hermione cause hes so small !said Hagrid .Small ?said Hermione .Small ?Hermione I couldn leave him said Hagrid tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard .See hes my brother !Hermione simply stared at him her mouth open .Hagrid when you say ‘brother said Harry slowly do you mean ?Well halfbrother amended Hagrid .Turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad an she went an had Grawp here Grawp ?said Harry .Yeah .well thas what it sounds like when he says his name said Hagrid anxiously .He don speak a lot of English .Ive bin tryin ter teach him .Anyway she don seem ter have liked him much moren she liked me .See with giantesses what counts is producin good big kids and hes always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant ony sixteen foot Oh yes tiny !said Hermione with a kind of hysterical sarcasm .Absolutely minuscule !He was bein kicked around by all o them I jus couldn leave him Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back ?asked Harry .She well she could see it was right importan ter me said Hagrid twisting his enormous hands .Bu bu she got a bit tired of him after a while I must admit .so we split up on the journey home .She promised not ter tell anyone though .How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing ?said Harry .Well thas why it took so long see said Hagrid .Could ony travel by nigh an through wild country an stuff .Course he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter but he kep wantin ter go back .Oh Hagrid why on earth didnt you let him !said Hermione flopping down onto a rippedup tree and burying her face in her hands .What do you think youre going to do with a violent giant who doesnt even want to be here !Well now Violent thas a bit harsh said Hagrid still twisting his hands agitatedly .Ill admit he mighta taken a couple o swings at me when hes bin in a bad mood but hes gettin better loads better settlin down well .What are those ropes for then ?Harry asked .He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them .You have to keep him tied up ?said Hermione faintly .Well .yeah .said Hagrid looking anxious .See its like I say he doesn really know his strength Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest .So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do ?Hermione asked apprehensively .Look after him said Hagrid croakily .After Im gone .Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked .What what does that involve exactly ?Hermione inquired .Not food or anythin !said Hagrid eagerly .He can get his own food no problem .Birds an deer an stuff .No its company he needs .If I jus knew someone was carryin on tryin ter help him a bit .teachin him yeh know .Harry said nothing but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them .Grawp had his back to them .Unlike Hagrid who simply looked like a very oversize human Grawp looked strangely misshapen .What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognized as Grawp s head .It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling closegrowing hair the color of bracken .The rim of a single large fleshy ear was visible on top of the head which seemed to sit rather like Uncle Vernons directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between .The back under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together was very broad and as Grawp slept it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins .The legs were curled up under the body Harry could see the soles of enormous filthy bare feet large as sledges resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor .You want us to teach him Harry said in a hollow voice .He now understood what Firenzes warning had meant .His attempt is not working .He would do better to abandon it .Of course the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrids fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English .Yeah even if yeh jus talk ter him a bit said Hagrid hopefully .Cause I reckon if he can talk ter people hell understand more that we all like him really an want him to stay .Harry looked at Hermione who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face .Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back doesnt it ?he said and she gave a very shaky laugh .Yehll do it then ?said Hagrid who did not seem to have caught what Harry had just said .Well .said Harry already bound by his promise .Well try Hagrid .I knew I could count on yeh Harry Hagrid said beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again .An I don wan yeh ter put yerself out too much like .I know yehve got exams .If yeh could jus nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an have a little chat with him .Ill wake him up then introduce you Wha no !said Hermione jumping up Hagrid no dont wake him really we dont need But Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of them and was proceeding toward Grawp .When he was around ten feet away he lifted a long broken bough from the ground smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione and then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough .The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest .Birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away .In front of Harry and Hermione meanwhile the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him .All righ Grawpy ?said Hagrid in a wouldbe cheery voice backing away with the long bough raised ready to poke Grawp again .Had a nice sleep eh ?Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights .Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted .They looked up into his startlingly huge face which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing .It was as though the features had been hewn onto a great stone ball .The nose was stubby and shapeless the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of halfbricks .The small eyes were a muddy greenishbrown and just now were half gummed together with sleep .Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls to his eyes rubbed vigorously then without warning pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility .Oh my .Harry heard Hermione squeal terrified beside him .The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawps wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously .He was as Hagrid had said at least sixteen feet tall .Gazing blearily around he reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella seized a birds nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself .Anyway Grawpy shouted Hagrid looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs Ive brought some friends ter meet yeh .Remember I told yeh I might ?Remember when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit ?Remember that Grawpy ?But Grawp merely gave another low roar it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech .He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it toward him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go .Now Grawpy don do that !shouted Hagrid .Thas how you ended up pullin up the others And sure enough Harry could see the earth around the trees roots beginning to crack .I got company fer yeh !Hagrid shouted .Company see !Look down yeh big buffoon I brought yeh some friends !Oh Hagrid dont moaned Hermione but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawps knee a sharp poke .The giant let go of the top of the pine tree which swayed menacingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles and looked down .This said Hagrid hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood is Harry Grawp !Harry Potter !He migh be cornin ter visit yeh if I have ter go away understand ?The giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there .They watched in great trepidation as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them .An this is Hermione see ?Her Hagrid hesitated .Turning to Hermione he said Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy Hermione ?Ony its a difficult name fer him ter remember .No not at all squeaked Hermione .This is Hermy Grawp !An shes gonna be cornin an all !Isn tha nice ?Eh ?Two friends fer yeh ter GRAWPY NO !Grawps hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione Harry seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree so that Grawps fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air .BAD BOY GRAWPY !Harry heard Hagrid yelling as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree shaking and whimpering .VERY BAD BOY !YEH DON GRAB OUCH !Harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back his hand over his nose .Grawp apparently losing interest had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go .Righ said Hagrid thickly getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow .Well .there yeh are .Yehve met him an an now hell know yeh when yeh come back .Yeah .well .He looked up at Grawp who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground .Well I reckon thas enough fer one day said Hagrid .Well er well go back now shall we ?Harry and Hermione nodded .Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and still pinching his nose led the way back into the trees .Nobody spoke for a while not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last .Hermiones face was pale and set .Harry could not think of a single thing to say .What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest ?And he had promised that he Ron and Hermione would continue Hagrids totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant .How could Hagrid even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were lovably harmless fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans ?Hold it said Hagrid abruptly just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him .He pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow .Harry and Hermione raised their wands now that they had stopped walking they too could hear movement close by .Oh blimey said Hagrid quietly .I thought that we told you Hagrid said a deep male voice that you are no longer welcome here ?A mans naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward them through the dappled green half light .Then they saw that his waist joined smoothly with a horses chestnut body .This centaur had a proud highcheekboned face and long black hair .Like Hagrid he was armed A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his shoulders .How are yeh Magorian ?said Hagrid warily .The trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged behind him .Harry recognized the blackbodied and bearded Bane whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze .Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before .So he said with a nasty inflection in his voice before turning immediately to Magorian .We agreed I think what we would do if this human showed his face in the forest again ?This human now am I ?said Hagrid testily .Jus fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder ?You ought not to have meddled Hagrid said Magorian .Our ways are not yours nor are our laws .Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us .I dunno how yeh work that out said Hagrid impatiently .Hes done nothin except help Albus Dumbledore Firenze has entered into servitude to humans said a gray centaur with a hard deeply lined face .Servitude !said Hagrid scathingly .Hes doin Dumbledore a favor is all He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans said Magorian quietly .There can be no return from such disgrace .If yeh say so said Hagrid shrugging but personally I think yeh re makin a big mistake As are you human said Bane coming back into our forest when we warned you Now you listen ter me said Hagrid angrily .Ill have less of the ‘our forest if its all the same ter you .Its not up ter you who comes an goes in here No more is it up to you Hagrid said Magorian smoothly .I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young Theyre not his !interrupted Bane contemptuously .Students Magorian from up at the school !They have probably already profited from the traitor F irenze s teachings .Nevertheless said Magorian calmly the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime .We do not touch the innocent .Today Hagrid you pass .Henceforth stay away from this place .You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us .I won be kept outta the fores by a bunch of mules like you !said Hagrid loudly .Hagrid said Hermione in a highpitched and terrified voice as both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground lets go please lets go !Hagrid moved forward but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian .We know what you are keeping in the forest Hagrid !Magorian called after them as the centaurs slipped out of sight .And our tolerance is waning !Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian again .Youll tolerate him as long as hes here its as much his forest as yours !he yelled while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forward .Still scowling he looked down his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him .He seemed not to have felt it .Calm down you two he said turning to walk on while they panted along behind him .Ruddy old nags though eh ?Hagrid said Hermione breathlessly skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there if the centaurs dont want humans in the forest it doesnt really look as though Harry and I will be able Ah you heard what they said said Hagrid dismissively They wouldnt hurt foals I mean kids .Anyway we can let ourselves be pushed around by that lot .Nice try Harry murmured to Hermione who looked crestfallen .At last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes the trees began to thin .They were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and hear in the distance the definite sounds of cheering and shouting .Was that another goal ?asked Hagrid pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view .Or dyou reckon the match is over ?I dont know said Hermione miserably .Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms .He knew he could look little better .I reckon its over yeh know !said Hagrid still squinting toward the stadium .Look theres people cornin out already if you two hurry yeh ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an no onell know you werent there !Good idea said Harry .Well .see you later then Hagrid .I dont believe him said Hermione in a very unsteady voice the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid .I dont believe him .I really dont believe him .Calm down said Harry .Calm down !she said feverishly .A giant !A giant in the forest !And were supposed to give him English lessons !Always assuming of course we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out !I dont believe him !We havent got to do anything yet !Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back toward the castle .Hes not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen Oh come off it Harry !said Hermione angrily stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her .Of course hes going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest after what weve just seen who can blame Umbridge ?There was a pause in which Harry glared at her and her eyes filled slowly with tears .You didnt mean that said Harry quietly .No .well .all right .I didnt she said wiping her eyes angrily .But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself for us ?I dunno Weasley is our King Weasley is our King He didnt let the Quaffle in Weasley is our King .And I wish theyd stop singing that stupid song said Hermione miserably havent they gloated enough ?A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch .Oh lets get in before we have to meet the Slytherins said Hermione .Weasley can save anything He never leaves a single ring Thats why Gryffindors all sing Weasley is our King .Hermione .said Harry slowly .The song was growing louder but it was issuing not from a crowd of greenandsilverclad Slytherins but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly toward the castle which was bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders .Weasley is our King Weasley is our King He didnt let the Quaffle in Weasley is our King .No !said Hermione in a hushed voice .YES !said Harry loudly .HARRY !HERMIONE !yelled Ron waving the silver Quidditch Cup in the air and looking quite beside himself .WE DID IT !WE WON !They beamed up at him as he passed there was a scrum at the door of the castle and Rons head got rather badly bumped on the lintel but nobody seemed to want to put him down .Still singing the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight .Harry and Hermione watched them go beaming until the last echoing strains of Weasley Is Our King died away .Then they turned to each other their smiles fading .Well save our news till tomorrow shall we ?said Harry .Yes all right said Hermione wearily .Im not in any hurry .They climbed the steps together .At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest .Harry was not sure whether it was his imagination or not but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the distance almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots .O .W .L .S Rons euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup was such that he could not settle to anything next day .All he wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp not that either of them tried very hard neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion .As it was another fine warm day they persuaded him to join them in studying under the beech tree on the edge of the lake where they stood less chance of being overheard than in the common room .Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair not to mention the occasional outbursts of Weasley Is Our King but agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good .They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time .Well I mean Id already let in that one of Daviess so I wasnt feeling that confident but I dunno when Bradley came toward me just out of nowhere I thought you can do this And I had about a second to decide which way to fly you know because he looked like he was aiming for the right goal hoop my right obviously his left but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting and so I took the chance and flew left his right I mean and well you saw what happened he concluded modestly sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them a bunch of gossiping thirdyear Hufflepuffs had heard him .And then when Chambers came at me about five minutes later what ?Ron said stopping mid sentence at the look on Harrys face .Why are you grinning ?Im not said Harry quickly looking down at his Transfiguration notes and attempting to straighten his face .The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree .Im just glad we won thats all .Yeah said Ron slowly savoring the words we won .Did you see the look on Changs face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose ?I suppose she cried did she ?said Harry bitterly .Well yeah more out of temper than anything though .Ron frowned slightly .But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground didnt you ?Er said Harry .Well actually .no Ron said Hermione with a heavy sigh putting down her book and looking at him apologetically .As a matter of fact the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Daviess first goal .Rons carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment .You didnt watch ?he said faintly looking from one to the other .You didnt see me make any of those saves ?Well no said Hermione stretching out a placatory hand toward him .But Ron we didnt want to leave we had to !Yeah ?said Ron whose face was growing rather red .How come ?It was Hagrid said Harry .He decided to tell us why hes been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants .He wanted us to go into the forest with him we had no choice you know how he gets .Anyway .The story was told in five minutes by the end of which Rons indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity .He brought one back and hid it in the forest ?Yep said Harry grimly .No said Ron as though by saying this he could make it untrue .No he cant have .Well he has said Hermione firmly .Grawps about sixteen feet tall enjoys ripping up twentyfoot pine trees and knows me she snorted as Hermy .Ron gave a nervous laugh .And Hagrid wants us to . ?Teach him English yeah said Harry .Hes lost his mind said Ron in an almost awed voice .Yes said Hermione irritably turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses .Yes Im starting to think he has .But unfortunately he made Harry and me promise .Well youre just going to have to break your promise thats all said Ron firmly .I mean come on .Weve got exams and were about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a millimeter apart from being chucked out as it is .And anyway .remember Norbert ?Remember Aragog ?Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid s monster mates ?I know its just that we promised said Hermione in a small voice .Ron smoothed his hair flat again looking preoccupied .Well he sighed Hagrid hasnt been sacked yet has he ?Hes hung on this long maybe hell hang on till the end of term and we wont have to go near Grawp at all .The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake the satingreen lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze June had arrived but to the fifth years this meant only one thing Their O .W .L .s were upon them at last .Their teachers were no longer setting them homework lessons were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams .The purposeful feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the O .W .L .s from Harrys mind though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency tuition If he had then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry .This suited Harry very well he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency .She was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days .She was not the only person acting oddly as the O .W .L .s drew steadily nearer .Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their study habits .How many hours dyou think youre doing a day ?he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology a manic gleam in his eyes .I dunno said Ron .A few .More or less than eight ?Less I spose said Ron looking slightly alarmed .‘Tm doing eight said Ernie puffing out his chest .Eight or nine .Im getting an hour in before breakfast every day .Eights my average .I can do ten on a good weekend day .I did nine and a half on Monday .Not so good on Tuesday only seven and a quarter .Then on Wednesday ■ Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point forcing Ernie to abandon his recital .Meanwhile Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic .Of course its not what you know he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start its who you know .Now Fathers been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years old Griselda Marchbanks weve had her round for dinner and everything .Do you think thats true ?Hermione whispered to Harry and Ron looking frightened .Nothing we can do about it if it is said Ron gloomily .I dont think its true said Neville quietly from behind them .Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my grans and shes never mentioned the Malfoys .Whats she like Neville ?asked Hermione at once .Is she strict ?Bit like Gran really said Neville in a subdued voice .Knowing her wont hurt your chances though will it ?Ron told him encouragingly .Oh I dont think it will make any difference said Neville still more miserably .Grans always telling Professor Marchbanks Im not as good as my dad .Well .you saw what shes like at St .Mungos .Neville looked fixedly at the floor .Harry Ron and Hermione glanced at one another but didnt know what to say .It was the first time that Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the Wizarding hospital .Meanwhile a flourishing blackmarket trade in aids to concentration mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and seventh years .Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffios Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Eddie Carmichael who swore it was solely responsible for the nine Outstanding O .W .L .s he had gained the previous summer and was offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons .Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job but before they could close the deal Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet .Hermione we wanted to buy that !shouted Ron .Dont be stupid she snarled .You might as well take Harold Dingles powdered dragon claw and have done with it .Dingles got powdered dragon claw ?said Ron eagerly .Not anymore said Hermione .I confiscated that too .None of these things actually works you know Dragon claw does work !said Ron .Its supposed to be incredible really gives your brain a boost you come over all cunning for a few hours Hermione let me have a pinch go on it cant hurt This stuff can said Hermione grimly .Ive had a look at it and its actually dried doxy droppings .This information took the edge off Harry and Rons desire for brain stimulants .They received their examination schedules and details of the procedure for O .W .L .s during their next Transfiguration lesson .As you can see Professor McGonagall told the class while they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard your O .W .L .s are spread over two successive weeks .You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons .Your practical Astronomy examination will of course take place at night .Now I must warn you that the most stringent Anti Cheating Charms have been applied to your examination papers .AutoAnswer Quills are banned from the examination hall as are Remembralls Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self Correcting Ink .Every year I am afraid to say seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authoritys rules .I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor .Our new headmistress Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely because of course your examination results will reflect upon the headmistresss new regime at the school .Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh .Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare .However that is no reason not to do your very best .You have your own futures to think about .Please Professor said Hermione her hand in the air when will we find out our results ?An owl will be sent to you some time in July said Professor McGonagall .Excellent said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper so we dont have to worry about it till the holidays .Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks time waiting for his O .W .L .results .Well he thought at least he would be sure of one bit of post next summer .Their first exam Theory of Charms was scheduled for Monday morning .Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but regretted it almost at once .She was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer completely right finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming .Why dont you just do it yourself ?he said firmly handing the book back to her his eyes watering .Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears his lips moving soundlessly Seamus was lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells Grade 5 and Parvati and Lavender who were practicing basic locomotion charms were making their pencil cases race each other around the edge of the table .Dinner was a subdued affair that night .Harry and Ron did not talk much but ate with gusto having studied hard all day .Hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure .Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate .Oh my goodness she said faintly staring into the entrance hall .Is that them ?Is that the examiners ?Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench .Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient looking witches and wizards .Umbridge Harry was pleased to see looked rather nervous .Shall we go and have a closer look ?said Ron .Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double doors into the entrance hall slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners .Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs Umbridge was speaking to her very deferentially .Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf she was answering Umbridge very loudly considering that they were only a foot apart .Journey was fine journey was fine weve made it plenty of times before !she said impatiently .Now I havent heard from Dumbledore lately !she added peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard .No idea where he is I suppose ?None at all said Umbridge shooting a malevolent look at Harry Ron and Hermione who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace .But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough .I doubt it shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks not if Dumbledore doesnt want to be found !I should know .Examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N .E .W .T .s .Did things with a wand Id never seen before .Yes .well .said Professor Umbridge as Harry Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared let me show you to the staffroom .I daresay youd like a cup of tea after your journey .It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening .Everyone was trying to do some lastminute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very far .Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours .He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagalls furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did .He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here .He knew that he was not the only one lying awake but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally one by one they fell asleep .None of the fifth years talked very much at breakfast next day either .Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched Hermione was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade .Once breakfast was over the fifth and seventh years milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons .Then at halfpast nine they were called forward class by class to reenter the Great Hall which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father Sirius and Snape had been taking their O .W .L .s .The four House tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one all facing the stafftable end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them .When they were all seated and quiet she said You may begin and turned over an enormous hourglass on the desk beside her on which were also spare quills ink bottles and rolls of parchment .Harry turned over his paper his heart thumping hard .Three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling .He lowered his eyes to the first question a Give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make objects fly .Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll .Smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write .Well it wasnt too bad was it ?asked Hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later still clutching the exam paper .Im not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms I just ran out of time did you put in the countercharm for hiccups ?I wasnt sure whether I ought to it felt like too much and on question twentythree Hermione said Ron sternly weve been through this before .Were not going through every exam afterward its bad enough doing them once .The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school the four House tables reappeared over the lunch hour and then trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall where they were to wait until called for their practical examination .As small groups of students were called forward in alphabetical order those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand movements occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake .Hermiones name was called .Trembling she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass .Students who had already been tested did not return afterward so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done .Shell be fine remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests ?said Ron .Ten minutes later Professor Flitwick called Parkinson Pansy Patil Padma Patil Parvati Potter Harry .Good luck said Ron quietly .Harry walked into the Great Hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook .Professor Tofty is free Potter squeaked Professor Flitwick who was standing just inside the door .He pointed Harry toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner a short distance from Professor Marchbanks who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy .Potter is it ?said Professor Tofty consulting his notes and peering over his pincenez at Harry as he approached .The famous Potter ?Out of the corner of his eye Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him the wine glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed .Harry could not suppress a grin .Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly .Thats it he said in his quavery old voice no need to be nervous .Now if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me .On the whole Harry thought it went rather well his Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoys had been though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color Change and Growth Charms so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake .He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward .He could tell Ron though Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened .There was no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for Transfiguration next day .Harry went to bed his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories .He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse .At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall .They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium Harry felt he had done reasonably well and then on Thursday Defense Against the Dark Arts .Here for the first time Harry felt sure he had passed .He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure during the practical examination in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall .Oh bravo !cried Professor Tofty who was examining Harry again when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell .Very good indeed !Well I think thats all Potter .unless .He leaned forward a little .I heard from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden that you can produce a Patronus ?For a bonus point . ?Harry raised his wand looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked .Expecto Patronum .The silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall .All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically .Excellent !he said .Very well Potter you may go !As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met .There was a nasty smile playing around her wide slack mouth but he did not care .Unless he was very much mistaken and he was not planning on saying it to anybody in case he was he had just achieved an Outstanding O .W .L .On Friday Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from studying .They stretched and yawned beside the open window through which warm summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wizard chess .Harry could see Hagrid in the distance teaching a class on the edge of the forest .He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining he thought it must be unicorns because the boys seemed to be standing back a little when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in looking thoroughly bad tempered .How were the runes ?said Ron yawning and stretching .I mistranslated ‘ehwaz said Hermione furiously .It means ‘partnership not ‘defense I mixed it up with ‘eihwaz .Ah well said Ron lazily thats only one mistake isnt it youll still get Oh shut up said Hermione angrily it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail .And whats more someones put another niffler in Umbridges office I dont know how they got it through that new door but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off by the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg Good said Harry and Ron together .It is not good !said Hermione hotly .She thinks its Hagrid doing it remember ?And we do not want Hagrid chucked out !Hes teaching at the moment she cant blame him said Harry gesturing out of the window .Oh youre so naive sometimes Harry you really think Umbridge will wait for proof ?said Hermione who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off toward the girls dormitories banging the door behind her .Such a lovely sweettempered girl said Ron very quietly prodding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of Harrys knights .Hermione s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday the exam to which Harry was looking forward least and which he was sure would be the one that would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror .Sure enough he found the written exam difficult though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion He could describe its effects extremely accurately having taken it illegally in his second year .The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be .With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions .Neville who was sitting very near Harry also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class .When Professor Marchbanks said Step away from your cauldrons please the examination is over Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but that he had with luck avoided a fail .Only four exams left said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room .Only !said Hermione snappishly .Ive got Arithmancy and its probably the toughest subject there is !Nobody was foolish enough to snap back so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first years for giggling too loudly in the common room .Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesdays Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down .The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs the trick was to offer them all milk in turn knarls highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle feed and clean a firecrab without sustaining serious burns and choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn .Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window .When Harrys examiner a plump little witch this time smiled at him and told him he could leave Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbsup before heading back up to the castle .The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well enough Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of Jupiters moons right but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice .They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination .Even by Harrys low standards in Divination the exam went very badly .He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during tealeaf reading saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday .Well we were always going to fail that one said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase .He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiners reflection .We shouldnt have taken the stupid subject in the first place said Harry .Still at least we can give it up now .Yeah said Harry .No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly .And from now on I dont care if my tea leaves spell die Ron die Im just chucking them in the bin where they belong .Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them .He stopped laughing at once in case it annoyed her .Well I think Ive done all right in Arithmancy she said and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief .Just time for a quick look over our star charts before dinner then .When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven oclock they found a perfect night for stargazing cloudless and still .The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air .Each of them set up his or her telescope and when Professor Marchbanks gave the word proceeded to fill in the blank star chart he or she had been given .Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing .All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand and the scribbling of many quills .Half an hour passed then an hour the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished .As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart however the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn .Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more .Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it now examining Venus .He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there but something distracted him .Pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn .If they had not been moving and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they stood .Even at this distance Harry had a funny feeling that he recognized the walk of the squattest among them who seemed to be leading the group .He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside past midnight much less accompanied by five others .Then somebody coughed behind him and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam .He had quite forgotten Venuss position jamming his eye to his telescope he found it again and was again on the point of entering it on his chart when alert for any odd sound he heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog .He looked up his heart hammering .There were lights on in Hagrids windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them .The door opened and he distinctly saw six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the threshold .The door closed again and there was silence .Harry felt very uneasy .He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and not wanting to appear as though he was sneaking looks at anyone elses work he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrids cabin .Figures were now moving across the cabin windows temporarily blocking the light .He could feel Professor Marchbankss eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower .Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrids cabin .Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough .Try and concentrate now boys and girls he said softly .Most people returned to their telescopes .Harry looked to his left .Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrids .Ahem twenty minutes to go said Professor Tofty .Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as Mars .He bent to correct it .There was a loud BANG from the grounds .Several people said Ouch !as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes hastening to see what was going on below .Hagrids door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to Stun him .No !cried Hermione .My dear !said Professor Tofty in a scandalized voice .This is an examination !But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star charts anymore Jets of red light were still flying beside Hagrids cabin yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him .He was still upright and still as far as Harry could see fighting .Cries and yells echoed across the grounds a man yelled Be reasonable Hagrid !and Hagrid roared Reasonable be damned yeh won take me like this Dawlish !Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang attempting to defend Hagrid leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground .Hagrid gave a howl of fury lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him The man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again .Hermione gasped both hands over her mouth Harry looked around at Ron and saw that he too was looking scared .None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before .Look !squealed Parvati who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors seemed to have opened again more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn .Now really !said Professor Tofty anxiously .Only sixteen minutes left you know !But nobody paid him the slightest attention They were watching the person now sprinting toward the battle beside Hagrids cabin .How dare you !the figure shouted as she ran .How dare you !Its McGonagall !whispered Hermione .Leave him alone !Alone I say !said Professor McGonagalls voice through the darkness .On what grounds are you attacking him ?He has done nothing nothing to warrant such Hermione Parvati and Lavender all screamed .No fewer than four Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor McGonagall .Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her .For a moment she looked luminous illuminated by an eerie red glow then was lifted right off her feet landed hard on her back and moved no more .Galloping gargoyles !shouted Professor Tofty who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely .Not so much as a warning !Outrageous behavior !COWARDS !bellowed Hagrid his voice carrying clearly to the top of the tower and several lights flickered back on inside the castle .RUDDY COWARDS !HAVE SOME O THAT AN THAT Oh my gasped Hermione .Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers judging by their immediate collapse they had been knocked cold .Harry saw him double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been overcome by a spell but on the contrary next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back then Harry realized that Fangs limp body was draped around his shoulders .Get him get him !screamed Umbridge but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid s fists .Indeed he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over .Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed and Hagrid running fullpelt toward the distant gates disappeared into the darkness .There was a long minutes quivering silence everybody gazing openmouthed into the grounds .Then Professor Toftys voice said feebly Um .five minutes to go everybody .Though he had only filled in twothirds of his chart Harry was desperate for the end of the exam .When it came at last he Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase .None of the students were going to bed they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed .That evil woman !gasped Hermione who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage .Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night !She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawneys said Ernie Macmillan sagely squeezing over to join them .Hagrid did well didnt he ?said Ron who looked more alarmed than impressed .How come all the spells bounced off him ?Itll be his giant blood said Hermione shakily .Its very hard to Stun a giant theyre like trolls really tough .But poor Professor McGonagall .Four Stunners straight in the chest and shes not exactly young is she ?Dreadful dreadful said Ernie shaking his head pompously .Well Im off to bed .Night all .People around them were drifting away still talking excitedly about what they had just seen .At least they didnt get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban said Ron .I spect hes gone to join Dumbledore hasnt he ?I suppose so said Hermione who looked tearful .Oh this is awful I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long but now weve lost Hagrid too .They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full .The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people who had hastened to rouse their friends .Seamus and Dean who had arrived ahead of Harry Ron and Hermione were now telling everyone what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower .But why sack Hagrid now ?asked Angelina Johnson shaking her head .Its not like Trelawney hes been teaching much better than usual this year !Umbridge hates parthumans said Hermione bitterly flopping down into an armchair .She was always going to try and get Hagrid out .And she thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in her office piped up Katie Bell .Oh blimey said Lee Jordan covering his mouth .Its mes been putting the nifflers in her office Fred and George left me a couple Ive been levitating them in through her window .Shed have sacked him anyway said Dean .He was too close to Dumbledore .Thats true said Harry sinking into an armchair beside Hermione s .I just hope Professor McGonagalls all right said Lavender tearfully .They carried her back up to the castle we watched through the dormitory window said Colin Creevey .She didnt look very well .Madam Pomfrey will sort her out said Alicia Spinnet firmly .Shes never failed yet .It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared .Harry felt wide awake the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him .He was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her though Rons suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving BlastEnded Skrewts had its merits .He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested .Their final exam History of Magic was not to take place until that afternoon .Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last minute studying so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common room window trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the notes stacked threeandahalf feet high that Hermione had lent him .The fifth years entered the Great Hall at two oclock and took their places in front of their overturned examination papers .Harry felt exhausted .He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep .Then tomorrow he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch he was going to have a fly on Rons broom and savor their freedom from studying .Turn over your papers said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall flicking over the giant hourglass .You may begin .Harry stared fixedly at the first question .It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows .Slowly tortuously he began to write an answer .He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates .He simply skipped question four In your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riots of the eighteenth century ?thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end .He had a stab at question five How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1 749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence ?but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points .He had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere .He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten .Describe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join .I know this Harry thought though his brain felt torpid and slack .He could visualize a heading in Hermiones handwriting The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards .He had read these notes only this morning .He began to write looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks .He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair .Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it . .the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord but his appointment was contested by the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein because All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying burrowing rats .The sun was very hot on the back of his head .What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein ?Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls .He gazed blankly at the back of Parvati s head again .If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein .Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool .Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll hunting and give the trolls rights .but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls .That was it .He opened his eyes they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment .Slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what he had done so far .It did not seem very informative or detailed yet he was sure Hermiones notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages .He closed his eyes again trying to see them trying to remember .The confederation had met for the first time in France yes he had written that already .Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted .He had written that too .And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come Think he told himself his face in his hands while all around him quills scratched out neverending answers and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front .He was walking along the cool dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last .The black door swung open for him as usual and here he was in the circular room with its many doors .Straight across the stone floor and through the second door .patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry .He jogged the last few feet to the third door which swung open just like the others .Once again he was in the cathedralsized room full of shelves and glass spheres .His heart was beating very fast now .He was going to get there this time .When he reached number ninetyseven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows .But there was a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal .Harrys stomach contracted with fear .with excitement .A voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness Take it for me .Lift it down now .I cannot touch it .but you can .The black shape upon the floor shifted a little .Harry saw a longfingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm .heard the high cold voice say Cruciol The man on the floor let out a scream of pain attempted to stand but fell back writhing .Harry was laughing .He raised his wand the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless .Lord Voldemort is waiting .Very slowly his arms trembling the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head .His face was bloodstained and gaunt twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance .Youll have to kill me whispered Sirius .Undoubtedly I shall in the end said the cold voice .But you will fetch it for me first Black .You think you have felt pain thus far ?Think again .We have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream .But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the cold stone floor .Harry hit the ground and awoke still yelling his scar on fire as the Great Hall erupted all around him .OUT OF THE FIRE Im not going .I dont need the hospital wing .I dont want .He was gibbering trying to pull away from Professor Tofty who was looking at him with much concern and who had just helped Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them stared .Im Im fine sir Harry stammered wiping the sweat from his face .Really .I just fell asleep .Had a nightmare .Pressure of examinations !said the old wizard sympathetically patting Harry shakily on the shoulder .It happens young man it happens !Now a cooling drink of water and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall ?The examination is nearly over but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely ?Yes said Harry wildly .I mean .no .Ive done done as much as I can I think .Very well very well said the old wizard gently .I shall go and collect your examination paper and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down .Ill do that said Harry nodding vigorously .Thanks very much .He waited for the second when the old mans heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall then ran up the marble staircase and then more staircases toward the hospital wing hurtling along the corridors so fast that the portraits he passed muttered reproaches and burst through the double doors like a hurricane causing Madam Pomfrey who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montagues open mouth to shriek in alarm .Potter what do you think youre doing ?I need to see Professor McGonagall gasped Harry the breath tearing his lungs .Now .Its urgent .Shes not here Potter said Madam Pomfrey sadly .She was transferred to St .Mungos this morning .Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age ?Its a wonder they didnt kill her .Shes .gone ?said Harry stunned .The bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him .He remained quite still looking at Madam Pomfrey .Terror was rising inside him .There was nobody left to tell .Dumbledore had gone Hagrid had gone but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there irascible and inflexible perhaps but always dependably solidly present .I dont wonder youre shocked Potter said Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face .As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight !Cowardice thats what it was .Despicable cowardice .If I wasnt worried what would happen to you students without me Id resign in protest .Yes said Harry blankly .He strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood buffeted by the crowd the panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do .Ron and Hermione said a voice in his head .He was running again pushing students out of the way oblivious to their angry protests and shouts .He sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying toward him .Harry !said Hermione at once looking very frightened .What happened ?Are you all right ?Are you ill ?Where have you been ?demanded Ron .Come with me Harry said quickly .Come on Ive got to tell you something .He led them along the firstfloor corridor peering through doorways and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside and leaning against it facing them .Voldemorts got Sirius .What ?How dyou ?Saw it .Just now .When I fell asleep in the exam .But but where ?How ?said Hermione whose face was white .I dunno how said Harry .But I know exactly where .Theres a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls and theyre at the end of row ninetyseven .Hes trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there .Hes torturing him .Says hell end by killing him .Harry found his voice was shaking as were his knees .He moved over to a desk and sat down on it trying to master himself .Howre we going to get there ?he asked them .There was a moments silence .Then Ron said Gget there ?Get to the Department of Mysteries so we can rescue Sirius !Harry said loudly .But Harry .said Ron weakly .What ?What ?said Harry .He could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable .Harry said Hermione in a rather frightened voice er .how .how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there ?How do I know ?bellowed Harry .The question is how were going to get in there !But .Harry think about this said Hermione taking a step toward him its five oclock in the afternoon .The Ministry of Magic must be full of workers .How would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen ?Harry .theyre probably the two most wanted wizards in the world .You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected ?I dunno Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something !Harry shouted .Anyway the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever Ive been Youve never been there Harry said Hermione quietly .Youve dreamed about the place thats all .Theyre not normal dreams !Harry shouted in her face standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn .He wanted to shake her .How dyou explain Rons dad then what was all that about how come I knew what had happened to him ?Hes got a point said Ron quietly looking at Hermione .But this is just just so unlikely said Hermione desperately .Harry how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when hes been in Grimmauld Place all the time ?Sirius mightve cracked and just wanted some fresh air said Ron sounding worried .Hes been desperate to get out of that house for ages But why Hermione persisted why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon or whatever the thing is ?I dunno there could be loads of reasons !Harry yelled at her .Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesnt care about seeing hurt You know what Ive just thought of something said Ron in a hushed voice .Siriuss brother was a Death Eater wasnt he ?Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon !Yeah and thats why Dumbledores been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time !said Harry .Look Im sorry cried Hermione but neither of you are making sense and weve got no proof for any of this no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there Hermione Harrys seen them !said Ron rounding on her .Okay she said looking frightened yet determined Ive just got to say this .What ?You .This isnt a criticism Harry !But you do .sort of .I mean dont you think youve got a bit of a a savingpeoplething ?she said .He glared at her .And whats that supposed to mean a ‘savingpeoplething ?Well .you .She looked more apprehensive than ever .I mean .last year for instance .in the lake .during the Tournament .you shouldnt have .I mean you didnt need to save that little Delacour girl .You got a bit .carried away .A wave of hot prickly anger swept Harrys body how could she remind him of that blunder now ? .I mean it was really great of you and everything said Hermione quickly looking positively petrified at the look on Harrys face .Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do Thats funny said Harry in a trembling voice because I definitely remember Ron saying Id wasted time acting the hero .Is that what you think this is ?You reckon I want to act the hero again ?No no no !said Hermione looking aghast .Thats not what I mean at all !Well spit out what youve got to say because were wasting time here !Harry shouted .Im trying to say Voldemort knows you Harry !He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there its the kind of thing he does he knows youre the the sort of person whod go to Siriuss aid !What if hes just trying to get you into the Department of Myst ?Hermione it doesnt matter if hes done it to get me there or not theyve taken McGonagall to St .Mungos there isnt anyone left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell and if we dont go Sirius is dead !But Harry what if your dream was was just that a dream ?Harry let out a roar of frustration .Hermione actually stepped back from him looking alarmed .You dont get it !Harry shouted at her .Im not having nightmares Im not just dreaming !What dyou think all the Occlumency was for why dyou think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things ?Because theyre REAL Hermione Sirius is trapped Ive seen him Voldemorts got him and no one else knows and that means were the only ones who can save him and if you dont want to do it fine but Im going understand ?And if I remember rightly you didnt have a problem with my saving peoplething when it was you I was saving from the dementors or he rounded on Ron when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk I never said I had a problem !said Ron heatedly .But Harry youve just said it said Hermione fiercely .Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind if youd done Occlumency properly youd never have seen this IF YOU THINK IM JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN T SEEN Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind !WELL I EXPECT HED SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT ID JUST The classroom door opened .Harry Ron and Hermione whipped around .Ginny walked in looking curious followed by Luna who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally .Hi said Ginny uncertainly .We recognized Harrys voice what are you yelling about ?Never you mind said Harry roughly .Ginny raised her eyebrows .Theres no need to take that tone with me she said coolly .I was only wondering whether I could help .Well you cant said Harry shortly .Youre being rather rude you know said Luna serenely .Harry swore and turned away .The very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with Luna Lovegood .Wait said Hermione suddenly .Wait .Harry they can help .Harry and Ron looked at her .Listen she said urgently Harry we need to establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters Ive told you I saw Harry Im begging you please !said Hermione desperately .Please lets just check that Sirius isnt at home before we go charging off to London if we find out hes not there then I swear I wont try and stop you Ill come Ill ddo whatever it takes to try and save him Sirius is being tortured NOW !shouted Harry .We havent got time to waste But if this is a trick of VVoldemorts Harry weve got to check weve got to How ?Harry demanded .Howre we going to check ?Well have to use Umbridges fire and see if we can contact him said Hermione who looked positively terrified at the thought .Well draw Umbridge away again but well need lookouts and thats where we can use Ginny and Luna .Though clearly struggling to understand what was going on Ginny said immediately Yeah well do it and Luna said When you say ‘Sirius are you talking about Stubby Boardman ?Nobody answered her .Okay Harry said aggressively to Hermione Okay if you can think of a way of doing this quickly Im with you otherwise Im going to the Department of Mysteries right now The Department of Mysteries ?said Luna looking mildly surprised .But how are you going to get there ?Again Harry ignored her .Right said Hermione twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks .Right .well .One of us has to go and find Umbridge and and send her off in the wrong direction keep her away from her office .They could tell her I dont know that Peeves is up to something awful as usual .Ill do it said Ron at once .Ill tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something its miles away from her office .Come to think of it I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way .It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department .Okay she said her brow furrowed as she continued to pace .Now we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry or some Slytherins bound to go and tip her off .Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor said Ginny promptly and warn people not to go down there because someones let off a load of Garroting Gas .Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie .Ginny shrugged and said Fred and George were planning to do it before they left .Okay said Hermione well then Harry you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and well sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius Hes not there Hermione !I mean you can can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch I dont think you should be in there alone Lees already proved the windows a weak spot sending those nifflers through it .Even through his anger and impatience Harry recognized Hermione s offer to accompany him into Umbridges office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty .I .okay thanks he muttered .Right well even if we do all of that I dont think were going to be able to bank on more than five minutes said Hermione looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around .Five minutesll be enough said Harry .Cmon lets go Now ?said Hermione looking shocked .Of course now !said Harry angrily .What did you think were going to wait until after dinner or something ?Hermione Sirius is being tortured right now I oh all right she said desperately .You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and well meet you at the end of Umbridges corridor okay ?Harry did not answer but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside .Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusktilldawn endofexams celebration in the common room .Harry barely heard them .He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many blackmarket butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it the Invisibility Cloak and Siriuss knife secure in his bag before they noticed he had left them .Harry dyou want to chip in a couple of Galleons ?Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky .But Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron Hermione Ginny and Luna who were huddled together at the end of Umbridges corridor .Got it he panted .Ready to go then ?All right whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years passed them .So Ron you go and head Umbridge off .Ginny Luna if you can start moving people out of the corridor .Harry and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear .Ron strode away his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage .Meanwhile Ginnys equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction trailed by Lunas blonde one .Get over here muttered Hermione tugging at Harrys wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column .Are are you sure youre okay Harry ?Youre still very pale .Im fine he said shortly tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag .In truth his scar was aching but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow .It had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery .Here he said .He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them .You cant come down here !Ginny was calling to the crowd .No sorry youre going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase someones let off Garroting Gas just along here They could hear people complaining one surly voice said I cant see no gas .Thats because its colorless said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice but if you want to walk through it carry on then well have your body as proof for the next idiot who didnt believe us .Slowly the crowd thinned .The news about the Garroting Gas seemed to have spread people were not coming this way anymore .When at last the surrounding area was quite clear Hermione said quietly I think thats as good as were going to get Harry come on lets do it .Together they moved forward covered by the cloak .Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor .As they passed Ginny Hermione whispered Good one .dont forget the signal .Whats the signal ?muttered Harry as they approached Umbridges door .A loud chorus of Weasley Is Our King if they see Umbridge coming replied Hermione as Harry inserted the blade of Siriuss knife in the crack between door and wall .The lock clicked open and they entered the office .The garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine warming their plates but otherwise the office was as still and empty as last time .Hermione breathed a sigh of relief .I thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler .They pulled off the cloak .Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight peering down into the grounds with her wand out .Harry dashed over to the fireplace seized the pot of Floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate causing emerald flames to burst into life there .He knelt down quickly thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried Number twelve Grimmauld Place !His head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office floor .He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out upon the long cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place .There was nobody there .He had expected this yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room .Sirius ?he shouted .Sirius are you there ?His voice echoed around the room but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire .Whos there ?he called wondering whether it was just a mouse .Kreacher the houseelf came creeping into view .He looked highly delighted about something though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands which were heavily bandaged .Its the Potter boys head in the fire Kreacher informed the empty kitchen stealing furtive oddly triumphant glances at Harry .What has he come for Kreacher wonders ?Wheres Sirius Kreacher ?Harry demanded .The houseelf gave a wheezy chuckle .Master has gone out Harry Potter .Wheres he gone ?Wheres he gone Kreacher ?Kreacher merely cackled .Im warning you !said Harry fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position .What about Lupin ?MadEye ?Any of them are any of them here ?Nobody here but Kreacher !said the elf gleefully and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly toward the door at the end of the kitchen .Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his Mistress now yes he hasnt had a chance in a long time Kreachers Master has been keeping him away from her Where has Sirius gone ?Harry yelled after the elf .Kreacher has he gone to the Department of Mysteries ?Kreacher stopped in his tracks .Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him .Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going said the elf quietly .But you know !shouted Harry .Dont you ?You know where he is !There was a moments silence then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet .Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries !he said gleefully .Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again !And he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the hall .You !But before he could utter a single curse or insult Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head .He inhaled a lot of ash and choking found himself being dragged backward through the flames until with a horrible abruptness he was staring up into the wide pallid face of Professor Umbridge who had dragged him backward out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as though she was going to slit his throat .You think she whispered bending Harrys neck back even farther so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge ?I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in you foolish boy .Take his wand she barked at someone he could not see and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand .Hers too .Harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had just had her wand wrested from her as well .I want to know why you are in my office said Umbridge shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered .I was trying to get my Firebolt !Harry croaked .Liar .She shook his head again .Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons as you very well know Potter .You had your head in my fire .With whom have you been communicating ?No one said Harry trying to pull away from her .He felt several hairs part company with his scalp .LiaA shouted Umbridge .She threw him from her and he slammed into the desk .Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode .Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill smirking as he threw Harrys wand into the air one handed and then caught it again .There was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered each gripping Ron Ginny Luna and to Harrys bewilderment Neville who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation .All four of them had been gagged .Got em all said Warrington shoving Ron roughly forward into the room .That one .he poked a thick finger at Neville tried to stop me taking her he pointed at Ginny who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her so I brought him along too .Good good said Umbridge watching Ginnys struggles .Well it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasleyfree zone doesnt it ?Malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically .Umbridge gave her wide complacent smile and settled herself into a chintzcovered armchair blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed .So Potter she said .You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon she nodded at Ron and Malfoy laughed even louder to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes Mr Filch having just informed me so .Clearly it was very important for you to talk to somebody .Was it Albus Dumbledore ?Or the half breed Hagrid ?I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone .Malfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that .Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking .Its none of your business who I talk to he snarled .Umbridges slack face seemed to tighten .Very well she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice .Very well Mr Potter .I offered you the chance to tell me freely .You refused .I have no alternative but to force you .Draco fetch Professor Snape .Malfoy stowed Harrys wand inside his robes and left the room smirking but Harry hardly noticed .He had just realized something he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it .He had thought that all the members of the Order all those who could help him save Sirius were gone but he had been wrong .There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts Snape .There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the Slytherins efforts to keep Ron and the others under control .Rons lip was bleeding onto Umbridges carpet as he struggled against Warringtons half nelson .Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixthyear girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip .Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbes arms and Hermione was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her .Luna however stood limply by the side of her captor gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings .Harry looked back at Umbridge who was watching him closely .He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the room holding open the door for Snape .You wanted to see me Headmistress ?said Snape looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference .Ah Professor Snape said Umbridge smiling widely and standing up again .Yes I would like another bottle of Veritaserum as quick as you can please .You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter he said observing her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair .Surely you did not use it all ?I told you that three drops would be sufficient .Umbridge flushed .You can make some more cant you ?she said her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious .Certainly said Snape his lip curling .It takes a full moon cycle to mature so I should have it ready for you in around a month .A month ?squawked Umbridge swelling toadishly .A month ?But I need it this evening Snape !I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown !Really ?said Snape showing his first faint sign of interest as he looked around at Harry .Well it doesnt surprise me .Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules .His cold dark eyes were boring into Harrys who met his gaze unflinchingly concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream willing Snape to read it in his mind to understand .I wish to interrogate him !shouted Umbridge angrily and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face .I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth !I have already told you said Snape smoothly that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum .Unless you wish to poison Potter and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did I cannot help you .The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truthtelling .Snape looked back at Harry who stared at him frantic to communicate without words .Voldemorts got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries he thought desperately .Voldemorts got Sirius You are on probation !shrieked Professor Umbridge and Snape looked back at her his eyebrows slightly raised .You are being deliberately unhelpful !I expected better Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you !Now get out of my office !Snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave .Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door .Hes got Padfoot !he shouted .Hes got Padfoot at the place where its hidden !Snape had stopped with his hand on Umbridges door handle .Padfoot ?cried Professor Umbridge looking eagerly from Harry to Snape .What is Padfoot ?Where what is hidden ?What does he mean Snape ?Snape looked around at Harry .His face was inscrutable .Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge .I have no idea said Snape coldly .Potter when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage .And Crabbe loosen your hold a little if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job .He closed the door behind him with a snap leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before Snape had been his very last hope .He looked at Umbridge who seemed to be feeling the same way her chest was heaving with rage and frustration .Very well she said and she pulled out her wand .Very well .I am left with no alternative .This is more than a matter of school discipline .This is an issue of Ministry security .Yes .yes .She seemed to be talking herself into something .She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot staring at Harry beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily .Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand as he watched her .You are forcing me Potter .I do not want to said Umbridge still moving restlessly on the spot but sometimes circumstances justify the use .I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice .Malfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face .The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue said Umbridge quietly .No !shrieked Hermione .Professor Umbridge its illegal but Umbridge took no notice .There was a nasty eager excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before .She raised her wand .The Minister wouldnt want you to break the law Professor Umbridge !cried Hermione .What Cornelius doesnt know wont hurt him said Umbridge who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harrys body in turn apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most .He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him all the same .It was you ?gasped Harry .You sent the dementors after me ?Somebody had to act breathed Umbridge as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harrys forehead .They were all bleating about silencing you somehow discrediting you but I was the one who actually did something about it .Only you wriggled out of that one didnt you Potter ?Not today though not now .And taking a deep breath she cried Cruc NO !shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode .No Harry Harry well have to tell her !No way !yelled Harry staring at the little of Hermione he could see .Well have to Harry shell force it out of you anyway whats .whats the point . ?And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode s robes .Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted .Well well well !said Umbridge looking triumphant .Little Miss QuestionAll is going to give us some answers !Come on then girl come on !Er my nee no !shouted Ron through his gag .Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before Neville still choking for breath was gazing at her too .But Harry had just noticed something .Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands there was no trace of a tear .Im Im sorry everyone said Hermione .But I cant stand it ■ Thats right thats right girl !said Umbridge seizing Hermione by the shoulders thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her .Now then .with whom was Potter communicating just now ?Well gulped Hermione into her hands well he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore .Ron froze his eyes wide Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captors toes even Luna looked mildly surprised .Fortunately the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs .Dumbledore ?said Umbridge eagerly .You know where Dumbledore is then ?Well .no !sobbed Hermione .Weve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hogs Head Idiot girl Dumbledore wont be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministrys looking for him !shouted Umbridge disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face .But but we needed to tell him something important !wailed Hermione holding her hands more tightly over her face not Harry knew out of anguish but to disguise the continued absence of tears .Yes ?said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement .What was it you wanted to tell him ?We .we wanted to tell him its rready !choked Hermione .Whats ready ?demanded Umbridge and now she grabbed Hermione s shoulders again and shook her slightly .Whats ready girl ?The .the weapon said Hermione .Weapon ?Weapon ?said Umbridge and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement .You have been developing some method of resistance ?A weapon you could use against the Ministry ?On Professor Dumbledores orders of course ?Yyyes gasped Hermione .But he had to leave before it was finished and nnnow weve finished it for him and we cccant find him ttto tell him !What kind of weapon is it ?said Umbridge harshly her stubby hands still tight on Hermione s shoulders .We dont rrreally understand it said Hermione sniffing loudly .We jjjust did what PPProfessor Dumbledore told us ttto do .Umbridge straightened up looking exultant .Lead me to the weapon she said .‘Tm not showing .them said Hermione shrilly looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers .It is not for you to set conditions said Professor Umbridge harshly .Fine said Hermione now sobbing into her hands again fine .let them see it I hope they use it on you !In fact I wish youd invite loads and loads of people to come and see !Ththat would serve you right oh Id love it if the whwhole school knew where it was and how to uuse it and then if you annoy any of them theyll be able to ssort you out !These words had a powerful impact on Umbridge .She glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face .Umbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment and then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice .All right dear lets make it just you and me .and well take Potter too shall we ?Get up now Professor said Malfoy eagerly Professor Umbridge I think some of the squad should come with you to look after I am a fully qualified Ministry official Malfoy do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone ?asked Umbridge sharply .In any case it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see .You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these she gestured around at Ron Ginny Neville and Luna escape .All right said Malfoy looking sulky and disappointed .And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way said Umbridge pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand .Lead on .FIGHT AND FLIGHT Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning or even whether she had a plan .He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umb ridges office knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going .He did not dare attempt to talk to her Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing .Hermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall .The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall .It seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner celebrating the end of exams not a care in the world .Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air .The sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass Umbridge jogging to keep up .Their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks .Its hidden in Hagrids hut is it ?said Umbridge eagerly in Harrys ear .Of course not said Hermione scathingly .Hagrid might have set it off accidentally .Yes said Umbridge whose excitement seemed to be mounting .Yes he would have done of course the great halfbreed oaf .She laughed .Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her by the throat but resisted .His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned whitehot as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill .Then .where is it ?asked Umbridge with a hint of uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride toward the forest .In there of course said Hermione pointing into the dark trees .It had to be somewhere that students werent going to find it accidentally didnt it ?Of course said Umbridge though she sounded a little apprehensive now .Of course .very well then .you two stay ahead of me .Can we have your wand then if were going first ?Harry asked her .No I dont think so Mr Potter said Umbridge sweetly poking him in the back with it .The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours Im afraid .As they reached the cool shade of the first trees Harry tried to catch Hermione s eye walking into the forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening .She however merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees moving at such a pace that Umbridge with her shorter legs had difficulty in keeping up .Is it very far in ?Umbridge asked as her robe ripped on a bramble .Oh yes said Hermione .Yes its well hidden .Harrys misgivings increased .Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp but the one he had followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog .Hermione had not been with him on that occasion he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it .Er are you sure this is the right way ?he asked her pointedly .Oh yes she said in a steely voice crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise .Behind them Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling .Neither of them paused to help her up again Hermione merely strode on calling loudly over her shoulder Its a bit further in !Hermione keep your voice down Harry muttered hurrying to catch up with her .Anything could be listening in here I want us heard she answered quietly as Umbridge jogged noisily after them .Youll see .They walked on for what seemed a long time until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light .Harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest one of being watched by unseen eyes .How much further ?demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him .Not far now !shouted Hermione as they emerged into a dim dank clearing .Just a little bit An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head .The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves .Harry could feel the forest floor trembling Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield He wrenched himself free of her and turned .Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side their bows raised and loaded pointing at Harry Hermione and Umbridge who backed slowly into the center of the clearing Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror .Harry looked sideways at Hermione .She was wearing a triumphant smile .Who are you ?said a voice .Harry looked left .The chestnutbodied centaur called Magorian was walking toward them out of the circle his bow like the others was raised .On Harrys right Umbridge was still whimpering her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur .I asked you who are you human said Magorian roughly .I am Dolores Umbridge !said Umbridge in a high pitched terrified voice .Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts !You are from the Ministry of Magic ?said Magorian as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly .Thats right !said Umbridge in an even higher voice .So be very careful !By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures any attack by halfbreeds such as yourselves on a human What did you call us ?shouted a wildlooking black centaur whom Harry recognized as Bane .There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them .Dont call them that !Hermione said furiously but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her .Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian she continued Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have nearhuman intelligence and therefore considered responsible for its actions ‘Nearhuman intelligence ?repeated Magorian as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground .We consider that a great insult human !Our intelligence thankfully far outstrips your own What are you doing in our forest ?bellowed the hardfaced gray centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest .Why are you here ?Your forest ?said Umbridge shaking now not only with fright but also it seemed with indignation .I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing .She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously .The sound of their wild neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving .Whose forest is it now human ?bellowed Bane .Filthy halfbreeds !she screamed her hands still tight over her head .Beasts !Uncontrolled animals !Be quiet !shouted Hermione but it was too late Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed Incarcerousl Ropes flew out of midair like thick snakes wrapping themselves tightly around the centaurs torso and trapping his arms .He gave a cry of rage and reared onto his hind legs attempting to free himself while the other centaurs charged .Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground .Facedown on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him but the centaurs leapt over and around them bellowing and screaming with rage .Nooooo !he heard Umbridge shriek .Noooooo .I am Senior Undersecretary .you cannot .unhand me you animals .nooooo !He saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun one of them then she screamed very loudly .Lifting his head a few inches Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air wriggling and yelling with fright .Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harrys heart leapt if he could just reach it But as he stretched out a hand toward it a centaurs hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half .Now !roared a voice in Harrys ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright Hermione too had been pulled to her feet .Over the plunging manycolored backs and heads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane still screaming nonstop her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them .And these ?said the hardfaced gray centaur holding Hermione .They are young said a slow doleful voice from behind Harry .We do not attack foals .They brought her here Ronan replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry .And they are not so young .He is nearing manhood this one .He shook Harry by the neck of his robes .Please said Hermione breathlessly please dont attack us we dont think like her we arent Ministry of Magic employees !We only came in here because we hoped youd drive her off for us Harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur holding Hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this .The gray centaur threw back his head his back legs stamping furiously and bellowed You see Ronan ?They already have the arrogance of their kind !So we were to do your dirty work were we human girl ?We were to act as your servants drive away your enemies like obedient hounds ?No !said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak .Please I didnt mean that !I just hoped youd be able to to help us But she seemed to be going from bad to worse .We do not help humans !snarled the centaur holding Harry tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time so that Harrys feet left the ground momentarily .We are a race apart and proud to be so .We will not permit you to walk from here boasting that we did your bidding !Were not going to say anything like that !Harry shouted .We know you didnt do anything because we wanted you to But nobody seemed to be listening to him .A bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted They came here unasked they must pay the consequences !A roar of approval met these words and a duncolored centaur shouted They can join the woman !You said you didnt hurt the innocent !shouted Hermione real tears sliding down her face now .We havent done anything to hurt you we havent used wands or threats we just want to go back to school please let us go back We are not all like the traitor Firenze human girl !shouted the gray centaur to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows .Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses ?We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults !We do not recognize your laws we do not acknowledge your superiority we are But they did not hear what else centaurs were for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them Harry Hermione and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing looked around .Harrys centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows Hermione had been dropped too and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap .The centaurs nearest him backed into those behind .The clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired all pointing upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches .Grawp s lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly .They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the halflight his dull sludgecolored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet .Broken ropes trailed from both ankles .He opened his mouth even wider .Hagger .Harry did not know what hagger meant or what language it was from nor did he much care he was watching Grawp s feet which were almost as long as Harrys whole body .Hermione gripped his arm tightly the centaurs were quite silent staring up at the giant whose huge round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped .Haggeii he said again more insistently .Get away from here giant !called Magorian .You are not welcome among us !These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp .He stooped a little the centaurs arms tensed on their bows and then bellowed HAGGER !A few of the centaurs looked worried now .Hermione however gave a gasp .Harry !she whispered .I think hes trying to say ‘Hagrid !At this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them the only two humans in a sea of centaurs .He lowered his head another foot or so staring intently at them .Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said in a deep rumbling voice Hermy .Goodness said Hermione gripping Harrys arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint he he remembered !HERMY !roared Grawp .WHERE HAGGER ?I dont know !squealed Hermione terrified .Im sorry Grawp I dont know !GRAWP WANT HAGGER !One of the giants massive hands swooped down upon them Hermione let out a real scream ran a few steps backward and fell over .Wandless Harry braced himself to punch kick bite or whatever else it took as the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow white centaur off his legs .It was what the centaurs had been waiting for Grawps outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant peppering his enormous face causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again rubbing his face with his enormous hands breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper .He yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way .Pebblesized droplets of Grawps blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees .Once there they looked back Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all down his face they were retreating in disorder galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing .As Harry and Hermione watched Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them smashing more trees aside as he went .Oh no said Hermione quaking so badly that her knees gave way .Oh that was horrible .And he might kill them all .Im not that fussed to be honest said Harry bitterly .The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant were growing fainter and fainter .As Harry listened to them his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him .They had wasted so much time they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision .Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever .Smart plan he spat at Hermione keen to release some of his fury .Really smart plan .Where do we go from here ?We need to get back up to the castle said Hermione faintly .By the time weve done that Sirius 11 probably be dead !said Harry kicking a nearby tree in temper there was a highpitched chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him .Well we cant do anything without wands said Hermione hopelessly dragging herself up again .Anyway Harry how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London ?Yeah we were just wondering that said a familiar voice from behind her .Harry and Hermione moved instinctively together peering through the trees as Ron came into sight with Ginny Neville and Luna hurrying along behind him .All of them looked a little the worse for wear there were several long scratches running the length of Ginnys cheek a large purple lump was swelling above Nevilles right eye Rons lip was bleeding worse than ever but all were looking rather pleased with themselves .So said Ron pushing aside a lowhanging branch and holding out Harrys wand had any ideas ?How did you get away ?asked Harry in amazement taking his wand from Ron .Couple of Stunners a Disarming Charm Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx said Ron airily now handing back Hermiones wand too .But Ginny was best she got Malfoy BatBogey Hex it was superb his whole face was covered in the great flapping things .Anyway we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed .Whatve you done with Umbridge ?She got carried away said Harry .By a herd of centaurs .And they left you behind ?asked Ginny looking astonished .No they got chased off by Grawp said Harry .Whos Grawp ?Luna asked interestedly .Hagrids little brother said Ron promptly .Anyway never mind that now .Harry what did you find out in the fire ?Has YouKnowWho got Sirius or ?Yes said Harry as his scar gave another painful prickle and Im sure Sirius is still alive but I cant see how were going to get there to help him .They all fell silent looking rather scared .The problem facing them seemed insurmountable .Well well have to fly wont we ?said Luna in the closest thing to a matteroffact voice Harry had ever heard her use .Okay said Harry irritably rounding on her first of all we arent doing anything if youre including yourself in that and second of all Rons the only one with a broomstick that isnt being guarded by a security troll so Ive got a broom !said Ginny .Yeah but youre not coming said Ron angrily .Excuse me but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do !said Ginny her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking .Youre too Harry began .Im three years older than you were when you fought YouKnowWho over the Sorcerers Stone she said fiercely and its because of me Malfoys stuck back in Umbridges office with giant flying bogeys attacking him Yeah but We were all in the D .A .together said Neville quietly .It was all supposed to be about fighting YouKnow Who wasnt it ?And this is the first chance weve had to do something real or was that all just a game or something ?No of course it wasnt said Harry impatiently .Then we should come too said Neville simply .We want to help .Thats right said Luna smiling happily .Harrys eyes met Rons .He knew that Ron was thinking exactly what he was If he could have chosen any members of the D .A .in addition to himself Ron and Hermione to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius he would not have picked Ginny Neville or Luna .Well it doesnt matter anyway said Harry frustratedly because we still dont know how to get there I thought wed settled that ?said Luna maddeningly .Were flying !Look said Ron barely containing his anger you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us cant sprout wings whenever we There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks said Luna serenely .I spose were going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is ?Ron demanded .The CrumpleHorned Snorkack cant fly said Luna in a dignified voice but they can and Hagrid says theyre very good at finding places their riders are looking for .Harry whirled around .Standing between two trees their white eyes gleaming eerily were two thestrals watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word .Yes !he whispered moving toward them .They tossed their reptilian heads throwing back long black manes and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest ones shining neck .How could he ever have thought them ugly ?Is it those mad horse things ?said Ron uncertainly staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral Harry was patting .Those ones you cant see unless youve watched someone snuff it ?Yeah said Harry .How many ?Just two .Well we need three said Hermione who was still looking a little shaken but determined just the same .Four Hermione said Ginny scowling .I think there are six of us actually said Luna calmly counting .Dont be stupid we cant all go !said Harry angrily .Look you three he pointed at Neville Ginny and Luna youre not involved in this youre not They burst into more protests .His scar gave another more painful twinge .Every moment they delayed was precious he did not have time to argue .Okay fine its your choice he said curtly .But unless we can find more thestrals youre not going to be able Oh more of them will come said Ginny confidently who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses .What makes you think that ?Because in case you hadnt noticed you and Hermione are both covered in blood she said coolly and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat so thats probably why these two turned up in the first place .Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve which was damp with Grawps blood .Okay then he said a bright idea occurring .Ron and I will take these two and go ahead and Hermione can stay here with you three and shell attract more thestrals Im not staying behind !said Hermione furiously .Theres no need said Luna smiling .Look here come more now .You two must really smell .Harry turned .No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking their way through the trees now their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies their eyes gleaming through the darkness .He had no excuse now .All right he said angrily pick one and get on then .THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily onto the horses silken back .It did not object but twisted its head around fangs bared and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes .He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the others .Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creatures back .Luna was already in place sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day .Ron Hermione and Ginny however were still standing motionless on the spot openmouthed and staring .What ?he said .Howre we supposed to get on ?said Ron faintly .When we cant see the things ?Oh its easy said Luna sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him Hermione and Ginny .Come here .She pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them onto the backs of their mounts .All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into the horses manes and told them to grip tightly before getting back onto her own steed .This is mad Ron said faintly moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horses neck .Mad .if I could just see it Youd better hope it stays invisible said Harry darkly .We all ready then ?They all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes .Okay .He looked down at the back of his thestrals glossy black head and swallowed .Ministry of Magic visitors entrance London then he said uncertainly .Er .if you know .where to go .For a moment his thestral did nothing at all .Then with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him the wings on either side extended the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump .He closed his eyes and put his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a bloodred sunset .Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast The thestral streaked over the castle its wide wings hardly beating .The cooling air was slapping Harrys face eyes screwed up against the rushing wind he looked around and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from its slipstream .They were over the Hogwarts grounds they had passed Hogsmeade .Harry could see mountains and gullies below them .In the falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills .This is bizarre !Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support .Twilight fell The sky turned to a light dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were traveling .Harrys arms were wrapped tightly around his horses neck as he willed it to go even faster .How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor ?How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort ?All Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort wanted nor died for he was convinced that either outcome would cause him to feel Voldemorts jubilation or fury course through his own body making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr Weasley was attacked .On they flew through the gathering darkness Harrys face felt stiff and cold his legs numb from gripping the thestrals sides so tightly but he did not dare shift positions lest he slip .He was deaf from the thundering in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the rush of cold night air .He had lost all sense of how far they had come all his faith was in the beast below him still streaking purposefully through the night barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onward .If they were too late .Hes still alive hes still fighting I can feel it .If Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack .Id know .Harrys stomach gave a jolt .The thestrals head was suddenly pointing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inches along its neck .They were descending at last .He heard one of the girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body .Presumably they had received a shock from the change of position just as he had .And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides .They could see the tops of buildings streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes squares of pale yellow that were windows .Quite suddenly it seemed they were hurtling toward the pavement .Harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength braced for a sudden impact but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from his back looking around at the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights .Ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thestral onto the pavement .Never again he said struggling to his feet .He made as though to stride away from his thestral but unable to see it collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again .Never ever again .that was the worst Hermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him .Both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground .Neville jumped down shaking but Luna dismounted smoothly .Where do we go from here then ?she asked Harry in a politely interested voice as though this was all a rather interesting day trip .Over here he said .He gave his thestral a quick grateful pat then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door .Come on he urged the others as they hesitated .Ron and Ginny marched in obediently Hermione Neville and Luna squashed themselves in after them Harry took one glance back at the thestrals now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster then forced himself into the box after Luna .Whoevers nearest the receiver dial six two four four two !he said .Ron did it his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial .As it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box Welcome to the Ministry of Magic .Please state your name and business .Harry Potter Ron Weasley Hermione Granger Harry said very quickly Ginny Weasley Neville Longbottom Luna Lovegood .Were here to save someone unless your Ministry can do it first !Thank you said the cool female voice .Visitors please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes .Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared .Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny s head he glanced at the topmost one .HARRY POTTER RESCUE MISSION Visitor to the Ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the Atrium .Fine !Harry said loudly as his scar gave another throb .Now can we move ?The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box .The scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic .A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and widening rose up their bodies .Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions peering through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium but it seemed to be completely empty .The light was dimmer than it had been by day .There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls but he saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling .The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening said the womans voice .The door of the telephone box burst open Harry toppled out of it followed by Neville and Luna .The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard the point of the centaurs arrow the tip of the goblins hat and the houseelfs ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool .Come on said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall Harry in the lead past the fountain toward the desk where the security man who had weighed Harrys wand had sat and which was now deserted .Harry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there sure that their absence was an ominous sign and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts .He pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately the golden grilles slid apart with a great echoing clanking and they dashed inside .Harry stabbed the number nine button the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend jangling and rattling .Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day that he had come with Mr Weasley he was sure that the din would raise every security person within the building yet when the lift halted the cool female voice said Department of Mysteries and the grilles slid open again they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches flickering in the rush of air from the lift .Harry turned toward the plain black door .After months and months of dreaming about it he was here at last .Lets go he whispered and he led the way down the corridor Luna right behind him gazing around with her mouth slightly open .Okay listen said Harry stopping again within six feet of the door .Maybe .maybe a couple of people should stay here as a as a lookout and And howre we going to let you know somethings coming ?asked Ginny her eyebrows raised .You could be miles away .Were coming with you Harry said Neville .Lets get on with it said Ron firmly .Harry still did not want to take them all with him but it seemed he had no choice .He turned to face the door and walked forward .Just as it had in his dream it swung open and he marched forward leading the others over the threshold .They were standing in a large circular room .Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling identical unmarked handleless black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue their cool shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it looked as though there was dark water underfoot .Someone shut the door Harry muttered .He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it .Without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor below .In his dream Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on .But there were around a dozen doors here .Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him trying to decide which was the right one there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways .The circular wall was rotating .Hermione grabbed Harrys arm as though frightened the floor might move too but it did not .For a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around and then quite as suddenly as it had started the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again .Harrys eyes had blue streaks burned into them it was all he could see .What was that about ?whispered Ron fearfully .I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from said Ginny in a hushed voice .Harry realized at once that she was right He could no sooner have picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jetblack floor .Meanwhile the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them .Howre we going to get back out ?said Neville uncomfortably .Well that doesnt matter now said Harry forcefully blinking to try and erase the blue lines from his vision and clutching his wand tighter than ever .We wont need to get out till weve found Sirius Dont go calling for him though !Hermione said urgently but Harry had never needed her advice less his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being .Where do we go then Harry ?Ron asked .I dont Harry began .He swallowed .In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room thats this one and then I went through another door into a room that kind of .glitters .We should try a few doors he said hastily .Ill know the right way when I see it .Cmon .He marched straight at the door now facing him the others following close behind him set his left hand against its cool shining surface raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened and pushed .It swung open easily .After the darkness of the first room the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter though there were no glittering shimmering lights such as Harry had seen in his dreams .The place was quite empty except for a few desks and in the very middle of the room an enormous glass tank of deepgreen water big enough for all of them to swim in which contained a number of pearly white objects that were drifting around lazily in the liquid .Whatre those things ?whispered Ron .Dunno said Harry .Are they fish ?breathed Ginny .Aquavirius maggots !said Luna excitedly .Dad said the Ministry were breeding No said Hermione .She sounded odd .She moved forward to look through the side of the tank .Theyre brains .Brains ?Yes .I wonder what theyre doing with them ?Harry joined her at the tank .Sure enough there could be no mistake now that he saw them at close quarters .Glimmering eerily they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water looking something like slimy cauliflowers .Lets get out of here said Harry .This isnt right we need to try another door There are doors here too said Ron pointing around the walls .Harrys heart sank how big was this place ?In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one he said .I think we should go back and try from there .So they hurried back into the dark circular room the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harrys eyes instead of the blue candle flames .Wait !said Hermione sharply as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them .FlagrateV She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the door .No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling and once again the wall began to revolve very fast but now there was a great redgold blur in amongst the faint blue and when all became still again the fiery cross still burned showing the door they had already tried .Good thinking said Harry .Okay lets try this one Again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open his wand still raised the others at his heels .This room was larger than the last dimly lit and rectangular and the center of it was sunken forming a great stone pit some twenty feet below them .They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheater or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot .Instead of a chained chair however there was a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor and upon this dais stood a stone archway that looked so ancient cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing .Unsupported by any surrounding wall the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched .Whos there ?said Harry jumping down onto the bench below .There was no answering voice but the veil continued to flutter and sway .Careful !whispered Hermione .Harry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit .His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly toward the dais .The pointed archway looked much taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down on it from above .Still the veil swayed gently as though somebody had just passed through it .Sirius ?Harry spoke again but much more quietly now that he was nearer .He had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway .Gripping his wand very tightly he edged around the dais but there was nobody there .All that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil .Lets go called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps .This isnt right Harry come on lets go .She sounded scared much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it old though it was .The gently rippling veil intrigued him he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it .Harry lets go okay ?said Hermione more forcefully .Okay he said but he did not move .He had just heard something .There were faint whispering murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil .What are you saying ?he said very loudly so that the words echoed all around the surrounding stone benches .Nobodys talking Harry !said Hermione now moving over to him .Someones whispering behind there he said moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil .Is that you Ron ?Im here mate said Ron appearing around the side of the archway .Cant anyone else hear it ?Harry demanded for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder without really meaning to put it there he found his foot was on the dais .I can hear them too breathed Luna joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil .There are people in there What do you mean ‘in there ?demanded Hermione jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted .There isnt any ‘in there its just an archway theres no room for anybody to be there Harry stop it come away She grabbed his arm and pulled but he resisted .Harry we are supposed to be here for Sirius !she said in a highpitched strained voice .Sirius Harry repeated still gazing mesmerized at the continuously swaying veil .Yeah .And then something slid back into place in his brain Sirius captured bound and tortured and he was staring at this archway .He took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil .Lets go he said .Thats what Ive been trying to well come on then !said Hermione and she led the way back around the dais .On the other side Ginny and Neville were staring apparently entranced at the veil too .Without speaking Hermione took hold of Ginnys arm Ron Nevilles and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door .What dyou reckon that arch was ?Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room .I dont know but whatever it was it was dangerous she said firmly again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door .Once more the wall spun and became still again .Harry approached a door at random and pushed .It did not move .Whats wrong ?said Hermione .Its .locked .said Harry throwing his weight at the door but it did not budge .This is it then isnt it ?said Ron excitedly joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open .Bound to be !Get out of the way !said Hermione sharply .She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said Alohomora Nothing happened .Siriuss knife !said Harry and he pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall .The others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door .It remained as firmly shut as ever .What was more when Harry looked down at the knife he saw that the blade had melted .Right were leaving that room said Hermione decisively .But what if thats the one ?said Ron staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing .It cant be Harry could get through all the doors in his dream said Hermione marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the nowuseless handle of Siriuss knife in his pocket .You know what could be in there ?said Luna eagerly as the wall started to spin yet again .Something blibbering no doubt said Hermione under her breath and Neville gave a nervous little laugh .The wall slid back to a halt and Harry with a feeling of increasing desperation pushed the next door open .This is it !He knew it at once by the beautiful dancing diamondsparkling light .As Harrys eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clocks gleaming from every surface large and small grandfather and carriage hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room so that a busy relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule marching footsteps .The source of the dancing diamondbright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room .This way !Harrys heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track .He led the way forward down the narrow space between the lines of the desks heading as he had done in his dream for the source of the light the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing glittering wind .Oh look .said Ginny as they drew nearer pointing at the very heart of the bell jar .Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny jewelbright egg .As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged which was carried to the very top of the jar but as it fell on the draft its feathers became bedraggled and damp again and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg .Keep going !said Harry sharply because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the eggs progress back into a bird .You dawdled enough by that old arch !she said crossly but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it .This is it Harry said again and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech .Its through here He glanced around at them all .They had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious .He looked back at the door and pushed .It swung open .They were there they had found the place high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small dusty glass orbs .They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets set at intervals along the shelves .Like those in the circular room behind them their flames were burning blue .The room was very cold .Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves .He could not hear anything nor see the slightest sign of movement .You said it was row ninetyseven whispered Hermione .Yeah breathed Harry looking up at the end of the closest row .Beneath the branch of blueglowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 53 .We need to go right I think whispered Hermione squinting to the next row .Yes .thats fiftyfour .Keep your wands out Harry said softly .They crept forward staring behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves the farther ends of which were in near total darkness .Tiny yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf .Some of them had a weird liquid glow others were as dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs .They passed row eightyfour .eightyfive .Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement but Sirius might be gagged now or else unconscious .or said an unbidden voice inside his head he might already be dead .Id have felt it he told himself his heart now hammering against his Adams apple .Id already know .Ninetyseven !whispered Hermione .They stood grouped around the end of the row gazing down the alley beside it .There was nobody there .Hes right down at the end said Harry whose mouth had become slightly dry .You cant see properly from here .And he led them forward between the towering rows of glass balls some of which glowed softly as they passed .He should be near here whispered Harry convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the darkened floor .Anywhere here .really close .Harry ?said Hermione tentatively but he did not want to respond .His mouth was very dry now .Somewhere about .here .he said .They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight .There was nobody there at all .All was echoing dusty silence .He might be .Harry whispered hoarsely peering down the alley next door .Or maybe .He hurried to look down the one beyond that .Harry ?said Hermione again .What ?he snarled .I .I dont think Sirius is here .Nobody spoke .Harry did not want to look at any of them .He felt sick .He did not understand why Sirius was not here .He had to be here .This was where he Harry had seen him .He ran up the space at the end of the rows staring down them .Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past .He ran the other way back past his staring companions .There was no sign of Sirius anywhere nor any hint of a struggle .Harry ?Ron called .What ?He did not want to hear what Ron had to say did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts .But the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others accusing stares .Have you seen this ?said Ron .What ?said Harry but eagerly this time it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there a clue he strode back to where they were all standing a little way down row ninetyseven but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves .What ?Harry repeated glumly .Its its got your name on said Ron .Harry moved a little closer .Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years .My name ?said Harry blankly .He stepped forward .Not as tall as Ron he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball .In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously and below that S .P .T .to A .P .W .B .D .Dark Lord and ?Harry Potter Harry stared at it .What is it ?Ron asked sounding unnerved .Whats your name doing down here ?He glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf .‘Tm not here he said sounding perplexed .None of the rest of us are here .Harry I dont think you should touch it said Hermione sharply as he stretched out his hand .Why not ?he said .Its something to do with me isnt it ?Dont Harry said Neville suddenly .Harry looked around at him .Nevilles round face was shining slightly with sweat .He looked as though he could not take much more suspense .Its got my name on said Harry .And feeling slightly reckless he closed his fingers around the dusty balls surface .He had expected it to feel cold but it did not .On the contrary it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours as though the glow of light within was warming it .Expecting even hoping that something dramatic was going to happen something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile after all he lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it .Nothing whatsoever happened .The others moved in closer around Harry gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust .And then from right behind them a drawling voice said Very good Potter .Now turn around nice and slowly and give that to me .35 BEYOND THE VEIL Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them blocking their way left and right eyes glinted through slits in hoods a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts .Ginny gave a gasp of horror .To me Potter repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand palm up .Harrys insides plummeted sickeningly .They were trapped and outnumbered two to one .To me said Malfoy yet again .Wheres Sirius ?Harry said .Several of the Death Eaters laughed .A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harrys left said triumphantly The Dark Lord always knows !Always echoed Malfoy softly .Now give me the prophecy Potter .I want to know where Sirius is !I want to know where Sirius is !mimicked the woman to his left .She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others the light from their wands dazzling Harrys eyes .Youve got him said Harry ignoring the rising panic in his chest the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninetyseventh row .Hes here .I know he is .The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo said the woman in a horrible mockbaby voice .Harry felt Ron stir beside him .Dont do anything he muttered .Not yet The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter .You hear him ?You hear him ?Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us !Oh you dont know Potter as I do Bellatrix said Malfoy softly .He has a great weakness for heroics the Dark Lord understands this about him .Now give me the prophecy Potter .I know Sirius is here said Harry though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly .I know youve got him !More of the Death Eaters laughed though the woman still laughed loudest of all .Its time you learned the difference between life and dreams Potter said Malfoy .Now give me the prophecy or we start using wands .Go on then said Harry raising his own wand to chest height .As he did so the five wands of Ron Hermione Neville Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him .The knot in Harrys stomach tightened .If Sirius really was not here he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all .But the Death Eaters did not strike .Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt said Malfoy coolly .It was Harrys turn to laugh .Yeah right !he said .I give you this prophecy is it ?And youll just let us skip off home will you ?The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked Accio Proph Harry was just ready for her .He shouted Protego before she had finished her spell and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it .Oh he knows how to play little bitty baby Potter she said her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood .Very well then I TOLD YOU NO !Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman .If you smash it !Harrys mind was racing .The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spunglass sphere .He had no interest in it .He just wanted to get them all out of this alive make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity .The woman stepped forward away from her fellows and pulled off her hood .Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestranges face making it gaunt and skull like but it was alive with a feverish fanatical glow .You need more persuasion ?she said her chest rising and falling rapidly .Very well take the smallest one she ordered the Death Eaters beside her .Let him watch while we torture the little girl .Ill do it .Harry felt the others close in around Ginny .He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her the prophecy held up to his chest .Youll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us he told Bellatrix .I dont think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it will he ?She did not move she merely stared at him the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth .So said Harry what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway ?He could not think what to do but to keep talking .Nevilles arm was pressed against his and he could feel him shaking .He could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his head .He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this because his mind was blank .Page lOOOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J .K .What kind of prophecy ?repeated Bellatrix the grin fading from her face .You jest Harry Potter .Nope not jesting said Harry his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater looking for a weak link a space through which they could escape .How come Voldemort wants it ?Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses .You dare speak his name ?whispered Bellatrix .Yeah said Harry maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him .Yeah IVe got no problem saying Vol Shut your mouth !Bellatrix shrieked .You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips you dare besmirch it with your halfbloods tongue you dare Did you know hes a halfblood too ?said Harry recklessly .Hermione gave a little moan in his ear .Voldemort ?Yeah his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle or has he been telling you lot hes pureblood ?STUPEF iVO !A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestranges wand but Malfoy had deflected it .His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered .Two figures pearly white as ghosts fluid as smoke unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak .Their Page lOOlHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J .K .voices vied with each other so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrixs shouts . .at the Solstice will come a new .said the figure of an old bearded man .DO NOT ATTACK !WE NEED THE PROPHECY !He dared he dares shrieked Bellatrix incoherently .He stands there filthy halfblood WAIT UNTIL WEVE GOT THE PROPHECY !bawled Malfoy . .and none will come after .said the figure of a young woman .The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air .Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor .They had however given Harry an idea .The problem was going to be conveying it to the others .You havent told me whats so special about this prophecy Im supposed to be handing over he said playing for time .He moved his foot slowly sideways feeling around for someone elses .Do not play games with us Potter said Malfoy .Im not playing games said Harry half his mind on the conversation half on his wandering foot .And then he found someones toes and pressed down upon them .A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermiones .What ?she whispered .Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries ?said Malfoy sneeringly .I what ?said Harry and for a moment he quite forgot his plan .What about my scar ?What ?whispered Hermione more urgently behind him .Can this be ?said Malfoy sounding maliciously delighted some of the Death Eaters were laughing again and under cover of their laughter Harry hissed to Hermione moving his lips as little as possible Smash shelves Dumbledore never told you ?Malfoy repeated .Well this explains why you didnt come earlier Potter the Dark Lord wondered why when I say go you didnt come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams .He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording .Did he ?said Harry .Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking to distract the Death Eaters .So he wanted me to come and get it did he ?Why ?Why ?Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted .Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries Potter are those about whom it was made as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him .And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me ?About both of you Potter about both of you .Havent you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby ?Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoys gray eyes were gleaming .Was this prophecy the reason Harrys parents had died the reason he carried his lightningbolt scar ?Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand ?Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me ?he said quietly gazing at Lucius Malfoy his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand .It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust .And hes made me come and get it for him ?Why couldnt he come and get it himself ?Get it himself ?shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter .The Dark Lord walk into the Ministry of Magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return ?The Dark Lord reveal himself to the Aurors when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin ?So hes got you doing his dirty work for him has he ?said Harry .Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it and Bode ?Very good Potter very good .said Malfoy slowly .But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell NOW !yelled Harry .Five different voices behind him bellowed REDUCTOl Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit .The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart pearlywhite figures unfurled into the air and floated there their voices echoing from who knew what longdead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor RUN !Harry yelled and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above he seized a handful of Hermiones robes and dragged her forward one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them .A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face .They were all yelling there were cries of pain thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron Ginny and Luna sprint past him their arms over their heads .Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward a hand caught him by the shoulder he heard Hermione shout Stupefy and the hand released him at once .They were at the end of row ninetyseven Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest .He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermiones voice urging Neville on .The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through it the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them Colloportus gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise .Where where are the others ?gasped Harry .He had thought that Ron Luna and Ginny had been ahead of them that they would be waiting in this room but there was nobody there .They must have gone the wrong way !whispered Hermione terror in her face .Listen !whispered Neville .Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed .Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar Leave Nott leave him I say the Dark Lord will not care for Notts injuries as much as losing that prophecy Jugson come back here we need to organize !Well split into pairs and search and dont forget be gentle with Potter until weve got the prophecy you can kill the others if necessary Bellatrix Rodolphus you take the left Crabbe Rabastan go right Jugson Dolohov the door straight ahead Macnair and Avery through here Rookwood over there Mulciber come with me !What do we do ?Hermione asked Harry trembling from head to foot .Well we dont stand here waiting for them to find us for a start said Harry .Lets get away from this door .They ran quietly as they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching toward the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room .They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut .Stand aside !said a rough voice .Alohomora As the door flew open Harry Hermione and Neville dived under desks .They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters robes drawing nearer their feet moving rapidly .They mightve run straight through to the hall said the rough voice .Check under the desks said another .Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend .Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted STUPEFY A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over .The second Death Eater however had leapt aside to avoid Harrys spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim .Avada Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees causing him to topple and his aim to go awry .Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried EXPELLIARMUS Both Harrys and the Death Eaters wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy both scrambled to their feet and charged after them the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels Neville bringing up the rear plainly horrors truck at what he had done .Get out of the way Harry !yelled Neville clearly determined to repair the damage .Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted STUPEFY !The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eaters shoulder and hit a glassfronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses .The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart glass flying everywhere then sprang back up onto the wall fully mended then fell down again and shattered The Death Eater had snatched up his wand which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar .Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned his mask had slipped so that he could not see he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted STUP STUPEFY screamed Hermione who had just caught up with them .The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest he froze his arm still raised his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar .Harry expected to hear a clunk for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor but instead his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest sprawled on his back on the table with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind .Accio Wand cried Hermione .Harrys wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him .Thanks he said right lets get out of Look out !said Neville horrified staring at the Death Eaters head in the bell jar .All three of them raised their wands again but none of them struck .They were all gazing openmouthed appalled at what was happening to the mans head .It was shrinking very fast growing balder and balder the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull his cheeks smooth his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz .A babys head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again .But even as they watched their mouths open the head began to swell to its previous proportions again thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin .Its time said Hermione in an awestruck voice .Time .The Death Eater shook his ugly head again trying to clear it but before he could pull himself together again it began to shrink back to babyhood once more .There was a shout from a room nearby then a crash and a scream .RON ?Harry yelled turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them .GINNY ?LUNA ?Harry !Hermione screamed .The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar .His appearance was utterly bizarre his tiny babys head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions narrowly missing Harry who ducked .Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm .You cant hurt a baby !There was no time to argue the point .Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position .Come on !he said again and leaving the ugly baby headed Death Eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room leading back into the black hallway .They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them .Veering left he burst instead into a small dark cluttered office and slammed the door behind them .Collo began Hermione but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside .With a cry of triumph both yelled IMPEDIMENT A Harry Hermione and Neville were all knocked backward off their feet .Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books the back of Harrys head slammed into the stone wall behind him tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react .WEVE GOT HIM !yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry IN AN OFFICE OFF Page lOlOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J .K .Silenciol cried Hermione and the mans voice was extinguished .He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask but no sound came out he was thrust aside by his fellow .Petrificus Totalusl shouted Harry as the second Death Eater raised his wand .His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward facedown onto the rug at Harrys feet stiff as a board and unable to move at all .Well done Ha But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame .It passed right across Hermiones chest she gave a tiny oh !as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless .HERMIONE !Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk his wand held up in front of him .The Death Eater kicked out hard at Nevilles head as he emerged his foot broke Nevilles wand in two and connected with his face Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose .Harry twisted around his own wand held high and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry who recognized the long pale twisted face from the Daily Prophet Antonin Dolohov the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts .Dolohov grinned .With his free hand he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harrys hand to himself then at Hermione .Though he could no longer Page lOUHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J .K .speak his meaning could not have been clearer Give me the prophecy or you get the same as her .Like you wont kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway !said Harry .A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly .He had one hand on Hermiones shoulder which was still warm yet did not dare look at her properly .Dont let her be dead dont let her be dead its my fault if shes dead .Whaddever you do Harry said Neville fiercely from under the desk lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin dond gib it to him !Then there was a crash outside the door and Dolohov looked over his shoulder the babyheaded Death Eater had appeared in the doorway his head bawling his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him .Harry seized his chance PETRIFICUS TOT ALU S The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forward across his comrade both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch .Hermione Harry said at once shaking her as the babyheaded Death Eater blundered out of sight again .Hermione wake up .Whaddid he do to her ?said Neville crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose .I dunno .Neville groped for Hermiones wrist .Dats a pulse Harry Ib sure id is .Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt lightheaded .Shes alive ?Yeah I dink so .There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of more footsteps but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room .Neville were not far from the exit Harry whispered .Were right next to that circular room .If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come Ill bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift .Then you could find someone .Raise the alarm .And whad are you going do do ?said Neville mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry .Ive got to find the others said Harry .Well Ib going do find dem wid you said Neville firmly .But Hermione Well dake her wid us said Neville firmly .Ill carry her youre bedder at fighding dem dan I ab He stood up and seized one of Hermiones arms glared at Harry who hesitated then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermiones limp form over Nevilles shoulders .Wait said Harry snatching up Hermiones wand from the floor and shoving it into Nevilles hand youd better take this .Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door .My grans going do kill be said Neville thickly blood spattering from his nose as he spoke dat was by dads old wand .Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously .The babyheaded Death Eater was screaming and banging into things toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks bawling and confused while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained TimeTurners continued to fall shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them .Hes never going to notice us he whispered .Cmon .keep close behind me .They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway which now seemed completely deserted .They walked a few steps forward Neville tottering slightly due to Hermiones weight .The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them and the walls began to rotate once more .The recent blow on the back of Harrys head seemed to have unsteadied him he narrowed his eyes swaying slightly until the walls stopped moving again .With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermiones fiery crosses had faded from the doors .So which way dyou reck ?But before they could make a decision as to which way to try a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it .Ron !croaked Harry dashing toward them .Ginny are you all ?Harry said Ron giggling weakly lurching forward seizing the front of Harrys robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes .There you are .Ha ha ha .You look funny Harry .Youre all messed up .Rons face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth .Next moment his knees had given way but he still clutched the front of Harrys robes so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow .Ginny ?Harry said fearfully .What happened ?But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position panting and holding her ankle .I think her ankles broken I heard something crack whispered Luna who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt .Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets it was a very odd place some of the time we were just floating in the dark Harry we saw Uranus up close !said Ron still giggling feebly .Get it Harry ?We saw Uranus ha ha ha A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Rons mouth and burst .Anyway one of them grabbed Ginnys foot I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face but .Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny who was breathing in a very shallow way her eyes still closed .And what about Ron ?said Harry fearfully as Ron continued to giggle still hanging off the front of Harrys robes .I dont know what they hit him with said Luna sadly but hes gone a bit funny I could hardly get him along at all .Harry said Ron pulling Harrys ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly you know who this girl is Harry ?Shes Loony .Loony Lovegood .ha ha ha .Weve got to get out of here said Harry firmly .Luna can you help Ginny ?Yes said Luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping putting an arm around Ginnys waist and pulling her up .Its only my ankle I can do it myself !said Ginny impatiently but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support .Harry pulled Rons arm over his shoulder just as so many months ago he had pulled Dudleys .He looked around They had a oneintwelve chance of getting the exit right the first time He heaved Ron toward a door they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall led by Bellatrix Lestrange .There they are !she shrieked .Stunning Spells shot across the room Harry smashed his way through the door ahead flung Ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione .They were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix .Colloportus shouted Harry and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side .It doesnt matter !said a mans voice .There are other ways in WEVE GOT THEM THEYRE HERE !Harry spun around .They were back in the Brain Room and sure enough there were doors all around the walls .He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first .Luna Neville help me !The three of them tore around the room sealing the doors as they went Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door .Colloportusl There were footsteps running along behind the doors every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one so it creaked and shuddered .Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall then as Harry reached the very top of the room he heard Luna cry Collo aargh ?He turned in time to see her flying through the air .Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time Luna hit a desk slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled as still as Hermione .Get Potter !shrieked Bellatrix and she ran at him .He dodged her and sprinted back up the room he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy Hey !said Ron who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry giggling .Hey Harry there are brains in here ha ha ha isnt that weird Harry ?Ron get out of the way get down But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank .Honest Harry theyre brains look Accio Brain The scene seemed momentarily frozen .Harry Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish .For a moment it seemed suspended in midair then it soared toward Ron spinning as it came and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it unraveling like rolls of film Ha ha ha Harry look at it said Ron watching it disgorge its gaudy innards .Harry come and touch it bet its weird RON NO !Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain but he was sure it would not be anything good .He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands .The moment they made contact with his skin the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Rons arms like ropes .Harry look whats happen no no I dont like it no stop stop But the thin ribbons were spinning around Rons chest now .He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopuss body .Diffindol yelled Harry trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes but they would not break .Ron fell over still thrashing against his bonds .Harry itll suffocate him !screamed Ginny immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eaters wands and hit her squarely in the face .She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious .STUBEFYl shouted Neville wheeling around and waving Hermiones wand at the oncoming Death Eaters .STUBEFY STUBEFYl But nothing happened one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville it missed him by inches .Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them .Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at him .Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others .It seemed to have worked .They streaked after him knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy and he dashed through the only door still open the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come .Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron find some way of releasing him he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step bouncing on every tier until at last with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais .The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters laughter .He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him .Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him .The prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand his wand clutched tightly in his right .He backed away looking around trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sights .The back of his legs hit something solid he had reached the dais where the archway stood .He climbed backward onto it .The Death Eaters all halted gazing at him .Some were panting as hard as he was .One was bleeding badly Dolohov freed of the full BodyBind was leering his wand pointing straight at Harrys face .Potter your race is run drawled Lucius Malfoy pulling off his mask .Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy .Let let the others go and Ill give it to you !said Harry desperately .A few of the Death Eaters laughed .You are not in a position to bargain Potter said Lucius Malfoy his pale face flushed with pleasure .You see there are ten of us and only one of you .or hasnt Dumbledore ever taught you how to count ?Hes dot alone !shouted a voice from above them .Hes still god be !Harrys heart sank .Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them Hermiones wand held fast in his trembling hand .Neville no go back to Ron STUBEFYl Neville shouted again pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn STUBEFYl .STUBE One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind pinioning his arms to his sides .He struggled and kicked several of the Death Eaters laughed .Its Longbottom isnt it ?sneered Lucius Malfoy .Well your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause .Your death will not come as a great shock .Longbottom ?repeated Bellatrix and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face .Why I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents boy .I DOE YOU HAB !roared Neville and he fought so hard against his captors encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted Someone Stun him !No no no said Bellatrix .She looked transported alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry then back at Neville .No lets see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents .Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy DOND GIB ID DO DEM !roared Neville who seemed beside himself kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor her wand raised .DOND GIB ID DO DEM HARRY !Bellatrix raised her wand .Cruciol Neville screamed his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground .The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor twitching and screaming in agony .That was just a taster !said Bellatrix raising her wand so that Nevilles screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet .She turned and gazed up at Harry .Now Potter either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way !Harry did not have to think there was no choice .The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out .Malfoy jumped forward to take it .Then high above them two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room Sirius Lupin Moody Tonks and Kingsley .Malfoy turned and raised his wand but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him .Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact but dived off the dais out of the way .The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor Through the darting bodies the flashes of light Harry could see Neville crawling along .He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville .Are you okay ?he yelled as another spell soared inches over their heads .Yes said Neville trying to pull himself up .And Ron ?I dink hes all right he was still fighding the brain when I left The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it leaving a crater right where Nevilles hand had been seconds before .Both scrambled away from the spot then a thick arm came out of nowhere seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright so that his toes were barely touching the floor .Give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy The man was pressing so tightly on Harrys windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away .Kingsley was fighting two at once Tonks still halfway up the tiered seats was firing spells down at Bellatrix nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying .He turned his wand backward toward the mans side but had no breath to utter an incantation and the mans free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy AARGH !Neville had come lunging out of nowhere Unable to articulate a spell he had jabbed Hermiones wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eaters mask .The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped STUPEFY The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off .It was Macnair Buckbeaks wouldbe killer one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot .Thanks !Harry said to Neville pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs .Then Harrys foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy then saw Moodys magic eye spinning away across the floor .Its owner was lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville Dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee .Tarantallegrcd he shouted his wand pointing at Neville whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again .Now Potter He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled Protego Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over Nevilles jerking legs but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell .Dolohov raised his wand again .Accio Proph Sirius hurtled out of nowhere rammed Dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way .The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harrys fingers but he had managed to cling to it .Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling their wands flashing like swords sparks flying from their wand tips Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione .Springing up Harry yelled Petrificus Totalusl Once again Dolohovs arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward landing with a crash on his back .Nice one !shouted Sirius forcing Harrys head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them .Now I want you to get out of They both ducked again .A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and Bellatrix triumphant running back toward the fray .Harry take the prophecy grab Neville and run !Sirius yelled dashing to meet Bellatrix .Harry did not see what happened next Kingsley swayed across his field of vision battling with the pockmarked Rookwood now maskless another jet of green light flew over Harrys head as he launched himself toward Neville Can you stand ?he bellowed in Nevilles ear as Nevilles legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably .Put your arm round my neck Neville did so Harry heaved Nevilles legs were still flying in every direction they would not support him and then out of nowhere a man lunged at them .Both fell backward Nevilles legs waving wildly like an overturned beetles Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed .The prophecy give me the prophecy Potter !snarled Lucius Malfoys voice in his ear and Harry felt the tip of Malfoys wand pressing hard between his ribs .No get off me .Neville catch it !Harry flung the prophecy across the floor Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest .Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled Impedimental Malfoy was blasted off his back .As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling .Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again but before he could draw breath to strike Lupin had jumped between them .Harry round up the others and GO !Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps .Nevilles legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight .Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step A spell hit the stone bench at Harrys heel .It crumbled away and he fell back to the step below Neville sank to the ground his legs still jerking and thrashing and thrust the prophecy into his pocket .Come on !said Harry desperately hauling at Nevilles robes .Just try and push with your legs He gave another stupendous heave and Nevilles robes tore all along the left seam the small spunglass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it one of Nevilles floundering feet kicked it .It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them .As both of them stared at the place where it had broken appalled at what had happened a pearlywhite figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air unnoticed by any but them .Harry could see its mouth moving but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them not one word of the prophecy could he hear .The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness .Harry Ib sorry !cried Neville his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder Ib so sorry Harry I didnd bean do ■ It doesnt matter !Harry shouted .Just try and stand lets get out of Dubbledorel said Neville his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over Harrys shoulder .What ?DUBBLEDORE !Harry turned to look where Neville was staring .Directly above them framed in the doorway from the Brain Room stood Albus Dumbledore his wand aloft his face white and furious .Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body they were saved .Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry who had no more thought of leaving .Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there .There were yells one of the Death Eaters ran for it scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite .Dumbledores spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line Only one couple were still battling apparently unaware of the new arrival .Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrixs jet of red light He was laughing at her .Come on you can do better than that !he yelled his voice echoing around the cavernous room .The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest .The laughter had not quite died from his face but his eyes widened in shock .Harry released Neville though he was unaware of doing so .He was jumping down the steps again pulling out his wand as Dumbledore turned to the dais too .It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall .His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch .And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfathers wasted oncehandsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place .Harry heard Bellatrix Lestranges triumphant scream but knew it meant nothing Sirius had only just fallen through the archway he would reappear from the other side any second .But Sirius did not reappear .SIRIUS !Harry yelled SIRIUS !He had reached the floor his breath coming in searing gasps .Sirius must be just behind the curtain he Harry would pull him back out again .But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest holding him back .Theres nothing you can do Harry Get him save him hes only just gone through !Its too late Harry We can still reach him Harry struggled hard and viciously but Lupin would not let go .Theres nothing you can do Harry .nothing .Hes gone .THE ONLY ONE HE EVER FEARED He hasnt gone !Harry yelled .He did not believe it he would not believe it still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had Lupin did not understand people hid behind that curtain he had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room Sirius was hiding simply lurking out of sight SIRIUS !he bellowed SIRIUS !He cant come back Harry said Lupin his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry .He cant come back because hes d HE IS NOT DEAD !roared Harry .SIRIUS !There was movement going on around them pointless bustling the flashes of more spells .To Harry it was meaningless noise the deflected curses flying past them did not matter nothing mattered except that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain was not going to emerge at any moment shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle Lupin dragged Harry away from the dais Harry still staring at the archway angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting But some part of him realized even as he fought to break free from Lupin that Sirius had never kept him waiting before .Sirius had risked everything always to see Harry to help him .If Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it the only possible explanation was that he could not come back .That he really was .Dumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes .MadEye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay and was attempting to revive her .Behind the dais there were still flashes of light grunts and cries Kingsley had run forward to continue Siriuss duel with Bellatrix .Harry ?Neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood .Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless .Harry .Ib really sorry .said Neville .His legs were still dancing uncontrollably .Was dat man was Sirius Black a a friend of yours ?Harry nodded .Here said Lupin quietly and pointing his wand at Nevilles legs he said Finite .The spell was lifted .Nevilles legs fell back onto the floor and remained still .Lupins face was pale .Lets lets find the others .Where are they all Neville ?Lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke .It sounded as though every word was causing him pain .Deyre all back dere said Neville .A brain addacked Ron bud I dink hes all righd and Herbiones unconscious bud we could feel a bulse There was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais .Harry saw Kingsley yelling in pain hit the ground .Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around .He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it .She was halfway up the steps now Harry no !cried Lupin but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupins slackened grip .SHE KILLED SIRIUS !bellowed Harry .SHE KILLED HIM ILL KILL HER !And he was off scrambling up the stone benches .People were shouting behind him but he did not care .The hem of Bellatrixs robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming .She aimed a curse over her shoulder .The tank rose into the air and tipped .Harry was deluged in the foul smelling potion within .The brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long colored tentacles but he shouted Wingardium Levioscd and they flew into the air away from him .Slipping and sliding he ran on toward the door .He leapt over Luna who was groaning on the floor past Ginny who said Harry what ?past Ron who giggled feebly and Hermione who was still unconscious .He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts .He ran but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls had begun to rotate again .Once more he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra .Wheres the exit ?he shouted desperately as the wall rumbled to a halt again .Wheres the way out ?The room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask .The door right behind him flew open and the corridor toward the lifts stretched ahead of him torch lit and empty .He ran .He could hear a lift clattering ahead of him .He sprinted up the passageway swung around the corner and slammed his fist onto the button to call a second lift .It jangled and banged lower and lower the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside now hammering the button marked Atrium .The doors slid shut and he was rising .He forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around .Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall but she looked back as he sprinted toward her and aimed another spell at him .He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells .There were no more footsteps .She had stopped running .He crouched behind the statues listening .Come out come out little HarryV she called in her mockbaby voice which echoed off the polished wooden floors .What did you come after me for then ?I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin !I am !shouted Harry and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am I am I am all around the room .aah .did you love him little baby Potter ?Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before .He flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed CrucioV Bellatrix screamed .The spell had knocked her off her feet but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had she was already on her feet again breathless no longer laughing .Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again her counterspell hit the head of the handsome wizard which was blown off and landed twenty feet away gouging long scratches into the wooden floor .Never used an Unforgivable Curse before have you boy ?she yelled .She had abandoned her baby voice now .You need to mean them Potter !You need to really want to cause pain to enjoy it righteous anger wont hurt me for long Ill show you how it is done shall I ?Ill give you a lesson Harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side .She screamed Cruciol and he was forced to duck down again as the centaurs arm holding its bow spun off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizards head .Potter you cannot win against me !she cried .He could hear her moving to the right trying to get a clear shot of him .He backed around the statue away from her crouching behind the centaurs legs his head level with the houseelfs .I was and am the Dark Lords most loyal servant I learned the Dark Arts from him and I know spells of such power that you pathetic little boy can never hope to compete Stupefy yelled Harry .He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain for him .She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck .Protegol The jet of red light his own Stunning Spell bounced back at him .Harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblins ears went flying across the room .Potter I am going to give you one chance !shouted Bellatrix .Give me the prophecy roll it out toward me now and I may spare your life !Well youre going to have to kill me because its gone !Harry roared and as he shouted it pain seared across his forehead .His scar was on fire again and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage .And he knows !said Harry with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix s own .Your dear old mate Voldemort knows its gone !Hes not going to be happy with you is he ?What ?What do you mean ?she cried and for the first time there was fear in her voice .The prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps !What do you think Voldemortll say about that then ?His scar seared and burned .The pain of it was making his eyes stream .LIAR !she shrieked but he could hear the terror behind the anger now .YOUVE GOT IT POTTER AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME Accio Prophecy !ACCIO PROPHECY !Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst .He waved his empty hand from behind the oneeared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him .Nothing there !he shouted .Nothing to summon !It smashed and nobody heard what it said tell your boss that No !she screamed .It isnt true youre lying MASTER I TRIED I TRIED DO NOT PUNISH ME Dont waste your breath !yelled Harry his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar now more terrible than ever .He cant hear you from here !Cant I Potter ?said a high cold voice .Harry opened his eyes .Tall thin and blackhooded his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt his scarlet slitpupiled eyes staring .Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen quite unable to move .So you smashed my prophecy ?said Voldemort softly staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes .No Bella he is not lying .I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind .Months of preparation months of effort .and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again .Master I am sorry I knew not I was fighting the Animagus Black !sobbed Bellatrix flinging herself down at Voldemorts feet as he paced slowly nearer .Master you should know Be quiet Bella said Voldemort dangerously .I shall deal with you in a moment .Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies ?But Master he is here he is below Voldemort paid no attention .I have nothing more to say to you Potter he said quietly .You have irked me too often for too long .AVADA KEDAVRAl Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist .His mind was blank his wand pointing uselessly at the floor .But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive leaping from its plinth and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort .The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms protecting Harry .What ?said Voldemort staring around .And then he breathed Dumbledore !Harry looked behind him his heart pounding .Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates .Voldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at Dumbledore who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand toward the remnants of the fountain the other statues sprang to life too .The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest before it dived at her pinning her to the floor .Meanwhile the goblin and the house elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall and the onearmed centaur galloped at Voldemort who vanished and reappeared beside the pool .The headless statue thrust Harry backward away from the fight as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both .It was foolish to come here tonight Tom said Dumbledore calmly .The Aurors are on their way By which time I shall be gone and you dead !spat Voldemort .He sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed instead hitting the security guards desk which burst into flame .Dumbledore flicked his own wand .The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry though shielded by his stone guard felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it .The spell whatever it was caused no visible damage to the shield though a deep gonglike note reverberated from it an oddly chilling sound .You do not seek to kill me Dumbledore ?called Voldemort his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield .Above such brutality are you ?We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man Tom Dumbledore said calmly continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall .Merely taking your life would not satisfy me I admit There is nothing worse than death Dumbledore !snarled Voldemort .You are quite wrong said Dumbledore still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks .Harry felt scared to see him walking along undefended shieldless .He wanted to cry out a warning but his headless guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it .Indeed your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield .This time it was the onearmed centaur galloping in front of Dumbledore that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces but before the fragments had even hit the floor Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip .A long thin flame flew from the tip it wrapped itself around Voldemort shield and all .For a moment it seemed Dumbledore had won but then the fiery rope became a serpent which relinquished its hold upon Voldemort at once and turned hissing furiously to face Dumbledore .Voldemort vanished .The snake reared from the floor ready to strike There was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood .Look outi Harry yelled .But even as he shouted one more jet of green light had flown at Dumbledore from Voldemorts wand and the snake had struck Fawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole .He burst into flame and fell to the floor small wrinkled and flightless .At the same moment Dumbledore brandished his wand in one long fluid movement the snake which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass For a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark rippling faceless figure shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass Then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool slopping wildly over the sides drenching the polished floor .MASTER !screamed Bellatrix .Sure it was over sure Voldemort had decided to flee Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard but Dumbledore bellowed Stay where you are Harry !For the first time Dumbledore sounded frightened .Harry could not see why .The hall was quite empty but for themselves the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under her statue and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor And then Harrys scar burst open .He knew he was dead it was pain beyond imagining pain past endurance He was gone from the hall he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began .They were fused together bound by pain and there was no escape And when the creature spoke it used Harrys mouth so that in his agony he felt his jaw move .Kill me now Dumbledore .Blinded and dying every part of him screaming for release Harry felt the creature use him again .If death is nothing Dumbledore kill the boy .Let the pain stop thought Harry .Let him kill us .End it Dumbledore .Death is nothing compared to this .And Ill see Sirius again .And as Harrys heart filled with emotion the creatures coils loosened the pain was gone Harry was lying facedown on the floor his glasses gone shivering as though he lay upon ice not wood .And there were voices echoing through the hall more voices than there should have been Harry opened his eyes saw his glasses lying at the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him but which now lay flat on its back cracked and immobile .He put them on and raised his head an inch to find Dumbledores crooked nose inches from his own .Are you all right Harry ?Yes said Harry shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly .Yeah Im wheres Voldemort where who are all these whats The Atrium was full of people .The floor was reflecting emeraldgreen flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall and a stream of witches and wizards was emerging from them .As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the houseelf and the goblin leading a stunnedlooking Cornelius Fudge forward .He was there !shouted a scarletrobed man with a ponytail who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before .I saw him Mr Fudge I swear it was YouKnowWho he grabbed a woman and Disapparated !I know Williamson I know I saw him too !gibbered Fudge who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles .Merlins beard here here !in the Ministry of Magic !great heavens above it doesnt seem possible my word how can this be ?If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries Cornelius said Dumbledore apparently satisfied that Harry was all right and walking forward so that the newcomers realized he was there for the first time a few of them raised their wands others simply looked amazed the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipperclad feet left the floor you will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber bound by an AntiDisapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them .Dumbledore !gasped Fudge apparently beside himself with amazement .You here I I He looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry Seize him !Cornelius I am ready to fight your men and win again !said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice .But a few minutes ago you saw proof with your own eyes that I have been telling you the truth for a year .Lord Voldemort has returned you have been chasing the wrong men for twelve months and it is time you listened to sense !I dont well blustered Fudge looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do .When nobody did he said Very well Dawlish !Williamson !Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see .Dumbledore you you will need to tell me exactly the Fountain of Magical Brethren what happened ?he added in a kind of whimper staring around at the floor where the remains of the statues of the witch wizard and centaur now lay scattered .We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts said Dumbledore .Harry Harry Potter ?Fudge spun around and stared at Harry who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him during Dumbledore and Voldemorts duel .Hehere ?said Fudge .Why whats all this about ?I shall explain everything repeated Dumbledore when Harry is back at school .He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizards head lay on the floor .He pointed his wand at it and muttered Portus .The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds then became still once more .Now see here Dumbledore !said Fudge as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it .You havent got authorization for that Portkey !You cant do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic you you His voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his halfmoon spectacles .You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts said Dumbledore .You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work .I will give you .Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and glanced at it half an hour of my time tonight in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here .After that I shall need to return to my school .If you need more help from me you are of course more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts .Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me .Fudge goggled worse than ever .His mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled gray hair .I you Dumbledore turned his back on him .Take this Portkey Harry .He held out the golden head of the statue and Harry placed his hand upon it past caring what he did next or where he went .I shall see you in half an hour said Dumbledore quietly .One .two .three .Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel .The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet the Atrium Fudge and Dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound .THE LOST PROPHECY Harrys feet hit solid ground again his knees buckled a little and the golden wizards head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor .He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledores office .Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmasters absence .The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindlelegged tables puffing and whirring serenely .The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures .Harry looked through the window .There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon Dawn was approaching .The silence and the stillness broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait was unbearable to him .If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him the pictures would have been screaming in pain .He walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think .But he had to think .There was no escape .It was his fault Sirius had died it was all his fault .If he Harry had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemorts trick if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was as Hermione had said banking on Harrys love of playing the hero .It was unbearable he would not think about it he could not stand it .There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine a dark hole where Sirius had been where Sirius had vanished .He did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it A picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said Ah .Harry Potter .Phineas Nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arms as he watched Harry with shrewd narrow eyes .And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning ?said Phineas .This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster .Or has Dumbledore sent you here ?Oh dont tell me .He gave another shuddering yawn .Another message for my worthless greatgreatgrandson ?Harry could not speak .Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead but Harry could not tell him .To say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable .A few more of the portraits had stirred now .Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob .It would not turn .He was shut in .I hope this means said the corpulent rednosed wizard who hung on the wall behind Dumbledores desk that Dumbledore will soon be back with us ?Harry turned .The wizard was eyeing him with great interest .Harry nodded .He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back but it remained immovable .Oh good said the wizard .It has been very dull without him very dull indeed .He settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry .Dumbledore thinks very highly of you as I am sure you know he said comfortably .Oh yes .Holds you in great esteem .The guilt filling the whole of Harrys chest like some monstrous weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed .Harry could not stand this he could not stand being Harry anymore .He had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else .The empty fireplace burst into emeraldgreen flame making Harry leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate .As Dumbledores tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake .Many of them gave cries of welcome .Thank you said Dumbledore softly .He did not look at Harry at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robes the tiny ugly featherless Fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the fullgrown Fawkes usually stood .Well Harry said Dumbledore finally turning away from the baby bird you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the nights events .Harry tried to say Good but no sound came out .It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused by his actions tonight and although Dumbledore was for once looking at him directly and though his expression was kindly rather than accusatory Harry could not bear to meet his eyes .Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now said Dumbledore .Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St .Mungos but it seems that she will make a full recovery .Harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler .He was sure that all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dumbledore spoke wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been and why there had been injuries .I know how you are feeling Harry said Dumbledore very quietly .No you dont said Harry and his voice was suddenly loud and strong .Whitehot anger leapt inside him .Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings .You see Dumbledore ?said Phineas Nigellus slyly .Never try to understand the students .They hate it .They would much rather be tragically misunderstood wallow in selfpity stew in their own Thats enough Phineas said Dumbledore .Harry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the opposite window .He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance .Sirius had appeared there once disguised as the shaggy black dog so he could watch Harry play .He had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been .Harry had never asked him .There is no shame in what you are feeling Harry said Dumbledore s voice .On the contrary .the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength .Harry felt the whitehot anger lick his insides blazing in the terrible emptiness filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words .My greatest strength is it ?said Harry his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium no longer seeing it .You havent got a clue .You dont know .What dont I know ?asked Dumbledore calmly .It was too much .Harry turned around shaking with rage .I dont want to talk about how I feel all right ?Harry suffering like this proves you are still a man !This pain is part of being human THEN I DONT WANT TOBE HUMAN !Harry roared and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindlelegged table beside him and flung it across the room .It shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall .Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright and the portrait of Armando Dippet said a Reallyl I DONT CARE !Harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace .IVE HAD ENOUGH IVE SEEN ENOUGH I WANT OUT I WANT IT TO END I DONT CARE ANYMORE He seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too .It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions .You do care said Dumbledore .He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office .His expression was calm almost detached .You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it .I DONT !Harry screamed so loudly that he felt his throat might tear and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him too shatter that calm old face shake him hurt him make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry .Oh yes you do said Dumbledore still more calmly .You have now lost your mother your father and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known .Of course you care .YOU DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL !Harry roared .YOU STANDING THERE YOU But words were no longer enough smashing things was no more help .He wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him that hatefully calm old face .He ran to the door seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it .But the door would not open .Harry turned back to Dumbledore .Let me out he said .He was shaking from head to foot .No said Dumbledore simply .For a few seconds they stared at each other .Let me out Harry said again .No Dumbledore repeated .If you dont if you keep me in here if you dont let me By all means continue destroying my possessions said Dumbledore serenely .I daresay I have too many .He walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching Harry .Let me out Harry said yet again in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore s .Not until I have had my say said Dumbledore .Do you do you think I want to do you think I give a I DONT CARE WHAT YOUVE GOT TO SAY !Harry roared .I dont want to hear anything youve got to say !You will said Dumbledore sadly .Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be .If you are to attack me as I know you are close to doing I would like to have thoroughly earned it .What are you talking ?It is my fault that Sirius died said Dumbledore clearly .Or I should say almost entirely my fault I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole .Sirius was a brave clever and energetic man and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger .Nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight .If I had been open with you Harry as I should have been you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight .And Sirius would not have had to come after you .That blame lies with me and with me alone .Harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he was unaware of it .He was gazing at Dumbledore hardly breathing listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing .Please sit down said Dumbledore .It was not an order it was a request .Harry hesitated then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dumbledore s desk .Am I to understand said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harrys left that my greatgreatgrandson the last of the Blacks is dead ?Yes Phineas said Dumbledore .I dont believe it said Phineas brusquely .Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place .He would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for Sirius through the house .Harry I owe you an explanation said Dumbledore .An explanation of an old mans mistakes .For I see now that what I have done and not done with regard to you bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age .Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels .But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young .and I seem to have forgotten lately .The sun was rising properly now .There was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and bright .The light fell upon Dumbledore upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard upon the lines gouged deeply into his face .I guessed fifteen years ago said Dumbledore when I saw the scar upon your forehead what it might mean .I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort .Youve told me this before Professor said Harry bluntly .He did not care about being rude .He did not care about anything very much anymore .Yes said Dumbledore apologetically .Yes but you see it is necessary to start with your scar .For it became apparent shortly after you rejoined the magical world that I was correct and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you or else feeling powerful emotion .I know said Harry wearily .And this ability of yours to detect Voldemorts presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers .Harry did not bother to nod .He knew all of this already .More recently said Dumbledore I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists .Sure enough there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence .I am speaking of course of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr Weasley .Yeah Snape told me Harry muttered .Professor Snape Harry Dumbledore corrected him quietly .But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you ?Why I did not teach you Occlumency ?Why I had not so much as looked at you for months ?Harry looked up .He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired .Yeah Harry mumbled .Yeah I wondered .You see continued Dumbledore heavily .I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so .I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was or had ever been closer than that of headmaster and pupil he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me .I feared the uses to which he would put you the possibility that he might try and possess you .Harry I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way .On those rare occasions when we had close contact I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes .I was trying in distancing myself from you to protect you .An old mans mistake .Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike on those occasions when he and Dumbledore made eye contact .Voldemorts aim in possessing you as he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction .It would have been yours .He hoped when he possessed you briefly a short while ago that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him .He sighed deeply .Harry was letting the words wash over him .He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago and now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius none of it mattered .Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasleys attack .I knew at once that my worst fears were correct Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you .In an attempt to arm you against Voldemorts assaults on your mind I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape .He paused .Harry watched the sunlight which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledores desk illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill .Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledores explanation .He could hear the occasional rustle of robes the slight clearing of a throat .Phineas Nigellus had still not returned .Professor Snape discovered Dumbledore resumed that you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months .Voldemort of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and as he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant .And then you saw Rookwood who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest telling Voldemort what we had known all along that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected .Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness .In this case either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing himself at last or else you would have to take it for him .It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency .But I didnt muttered Harry .He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart .I didnt practice I didnt bother I couldve stopped myself having those dreams Hermione kept telling me to do it if I had hed never have been able to show me where to go and Sirius wouldnt Sirius wouldnt Something was erupting inside Harrys head a need to justify himself to explain I tried to check if hed really taken Sirius I went to Umbridges office I spoke to Kreacher in the fire and he said Sirius wasnt there he said hed gone !Kreacher lied said Dumbledore calmly .You are not his master he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself .Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic .He he sent me on purpose ?Oh yes .Kreacher I am afraid has been serving more than one master for months .How ?said Harry blankly .He hasnt been out of Grimmauld Place for years .Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas said Dumbledore when Sirius apparently shouted at him to ‘get out .He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house .He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left .Blacks cousin Narcissa sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy .How do you know all this ?Harry said .His heart was beating very fast .He felt sick .He remembered worrying about Kreachers odd absence over Christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic .Kreacher told me last night said Dumbledore .You see when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries .He like you attempted to contact Sirius at once .I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridges office .Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place .When however you did not return from your trip into the forest with Dolores Umbridge Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemorts .He alerted certain Order members at once .Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said Alastor Moody Nymphadora Tonks Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin were at headquarters when he made contact .All agreed to go to your aid at once .Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened for I was due there at any moment .In the meantime he Professor Snape intended to search the forest for you .But Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you .He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened .And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry it was the elf who told me laughing fit to burst where Sirius had gone .He was laughing ?said Harry in a hollow voice .Oh yes said Dumbledore .You see Kreacher was not able to betray us totally .He is not SecretKeeper for the Order he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Orders confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal .He was bound by the enchantments of his kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master Sirius .But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it .Like what ?said Harry .Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you said Dumbledore quietly .Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother .Voldemort knew already of course that Sirius was in the Order that you knew where he was but Kreachers information made him realize that the one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black .Harrys lips were cold and numb .So .when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night .The Malfoys undoubtedly on Voldemorts instructions had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured .Then if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not .Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him .There seemed to be very little air in Harrys lungs his breathing was quick and shallow .And Kreacher told you all this .and laughed ?he croaked .He did not wish to tell me said Dumbledore .But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I persuaded him to tell me the full story before I left for the Department of Mysteries .And whispered Harry his hands curled in cold fists on his knees and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him She was quite right Harry said Dumbledore .I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect .I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us .I do not think that Sirius took me very seriously or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans Dont you blame dont you talk about Sirius like Harrys breath was constricted he could not get the words out properly .But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius .Kreacher s a lying foul he deserved Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards Harry said Dumbledore .Yes he is to be pitied .His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobbys .He was forced to do Siriuss bidding because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved but he felt no true loyalty to him .And whatever Kreachers faults it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreachers lot easier DONT TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT !Harry yelled .He was on his feet again furious ready to fly at Dumbledore who had plainly not understood Sirius at all how brave he was how much he had suffered What about Snape ?Harry spat .Youre not talking about him are you ?When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual Harry you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge said Dumbledore steadily but as I have explained he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said .It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest .It was he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell of Siriuss whereabouts .Harry disregarded this he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him .Snape Snape ggoaded Sirius about staying in the house he made out Sirius was a coward Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him said Dumbledore .Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons !Harry snarled .He threw me out of his office !I am aware of it said Dumbledore heavily .I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself though I was sure at the time that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence Snape made it worse my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him Harry remembered Rons thoughts on the subject and plunged on .How do you know he wasnt trying to soften me up for Voldemort make it easier for him to get inside my I trust Severus Snape said Dumbledore simply .But I forgot another old mans mistake that some wounds run too deep for the healing .I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father I was wrong .But thats okay is it ?yelled Harry ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls .Its okay for Snape to hate my dad but its not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher ?Sirius did not hate Kreacher said Dumbledore .He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice .Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike .The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie .We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long and we are now reaping our reward .SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT DID HE ?Harry yelled .I did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it Dumbledore replied quietly .Sirius was not a cruel man he was kind to houseelves in general .He had no love for Kreacher because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated .Yeah he did hate it !said Harry his voice cracking turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away .The sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked without realizing what he was doing without seeing the office at all .You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it thats why he wanted to get out last night I was trying to keep Sirius alive said Dumbledore quietly .People dont like being locked up !Harry said furiously rounding on him .You did it to me all last summer Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his longfingered hands .Harry watched him but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion or sadness or whatever it was from Dumbledore did not soften him .On the contrary he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness .He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him .Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his halfmoon glasses .It is time he said for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago Harry .Please sit down .I am going to tell you everything .I ask only a little patience .You will have your chance to rage at me to do whatever you like when I have finished .I will not stop you .Harry glared at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited .Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window then looked back at Harry and said Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts Harry safe and whole as I had planned and intended .Well not quite whole .You had suffered .I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncles doorstep .I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years .He paused .Harry said nothing .You might ask and with good reason why it had to be so .Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in ?Many would have done so more than gladly would have been honored and delighted to raise you as a son .My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive .You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized .Voldemort had been vanquished hours before but his supporters and many of them are almost as terrible as he were still at large angry desperate and violent .And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead .Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever ?No .I knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty years before he returned but I was sure he would do so and I was sure too knowing him as I have done that he would not rest until he killed you .I knew that Voldemort s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive .I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power .But I knew too where Voldemort was weak .And so I made my decision .You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows which he despises and which he has always therefore underestimated to his cost .I am speaking of course of the fact that your mother died to save you .She gave you a lingering protection he never expected a protection that flows in your veins to this day .I put my trust therefore in your mothers blood .I delivered you to her sister her only remaining relative .She doesnt love me said Harry at once .She doesnt give a damn But she took you Dumbledore cut across him .She may have taken you grudgingly furiously unwillingly bitterly yet still she took you and in doing so she sealed the charm I placed upon you .Your mothers sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you .I still dont While you can still call home the place where your mothers blood dwells there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort .He shed her blood but it lives on in you and her sister .Her blood became your refuge .You need return there only once a year but as long as you can still call it home there he cannot hurt you .Your aunt knows this .I explained what I had done in the letter I left with you on her doorstep .She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years .Wait said Harry .Wait a moment .He sat up straighter in his chair staring at Dumbledore .You sent that Howler .You told her to remember it was your voice I thought said Dumbledore inclining his head slightly that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you .I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son .It did said Harry quietly .Well my uncle more than her .He wanted to chuck me out but after the Howler came she she said I had to stay .He stared at the floor for a moment then said But whats this got to do with .He could not say Siriuss name .Five years ago then continued Dumbledore as though he had not paused in his story you arrived at Hogwarts neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked perhaps yet alive and healthy .You were not a pampered little prince but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances .Thus far my plan was working well .And then .well you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do .You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner much sooner than I had anticipated you found yourself facetoface with Voldemort .You survived again .You did more .You delayed his return to full power and strength .You fought a mans fight .I was .prouder of you than I can say .Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine said Dumbledore .An obvious flaw that I knew even then might be the undoing of it all .And yet knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to min it .I alone could prevent this so I alone must be strong .And here was my first test as you lay in the hospital wing weak from your struggle with Voldemort .I dont understand what youre saying said Harry .Dont you remember asking me as you lay in the hospital wing why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby ?Harry nodded .Ought I to have told you then ?Harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing but his heart was racing again .You do not see the flaw in the plan yet ?No .perhaps not .Well as you know I decided not to answer you .Eleven I told myself was much too young to know .I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven .The knowledge would be too much at such a young age .I should have recognized the danger signs then .I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew one day I must give a terrible answer .I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day .You were too young much too young .And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts .And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced .Once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams .You did not ask me again however why Voldemort had left that mark upon you .We discussed your scar oh yes .We came very very close to the subject .Why did I not tell you everything ?Well it seemed to me that twelve was after all hardly better than eleven to receive such information .I allowed you to leave my presence bloodstained exhausted but exhilarated and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought perhaps have told you then it was swiftly silenced .You were still so young you see and I could not find it in me to spoil that night of triumph .Do you see Harry ?Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now ?I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen that I had told myself I could avoid that I must avoid .I dont I cared about you too much said Dumbledore simply .I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed .In other words I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act .Is there a defense ?I defy anyone who has watched you as I have and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered .What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy ?I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands .We entered your third year .I watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors as you found Sirius learned what he was and rescued him .Was I to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry ?But now at the age of thirteen my excuses were running out .Young you might be but you had proved you were exceptional .My conscience was uneasy Harry .I knew the time must come soon .But you came out of the maze last year having watched Cedric Diggory die having escaped death so narrowly yourself .and I did not tell you though I knew now Voldemort had returned I must do it soon .And now tonight I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this .My only defense is this I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and I could not bring myself to add another the greatest one of all .Harry waited but Dumbledore did not speak .I still dont understand .Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth .He knew the prophecy had been made though he did not know its full contents .He set out to kill you when you were still a baby believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy .He discovered to his cost that he was mistaken when the curse intended to kill you backfired .And so since his return to his body and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety .This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return the knowledge of how to destroy you .The sun had risen fully now .Dumbledores office was bathed in it .The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops and behind him the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes .The prophecys smashed Harry said blankly .I was pulling Neville up those benches in the the room where the archway was and I ripped his robes and it fell .The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries .But the prophecy was made to somebody and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly .Who heard it ?asked Harry though he thought he knew the answer already .I did said Dumbledore .On a cold wet night sixteen years ago in a room above the bar at the Hogs Head Inn .I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all .The applicant however was the greatgreatgranddaughter of a very famous very gifted Seer and I thought it common politeness to meet her .I was disappointed .It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself .I told her courteously I hope that I did not think she would be suitable for the post .I turned to leave .Dumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkess perch .He bent down slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin carved with runes around the edges in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape .Dumbledore walked back to the desk placed the Pensieve upon it and raised his wand to his own temple .From it he withdrew silvery gossamerfine strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them in the basin .He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment .Then with a sigh he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip .A figure rose out of it draped in shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses and she revolved slowly her feet in the basin .But when Sibyll Trelawney spoke it was not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before .The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches .Born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies .and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not .and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives .The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies .The slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished .The silence within the office was absolute .Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound .Even Fawkes had fallen silent .Professor Dumbledore ?Harry said very quietly for Dumbledore still staring at the Pensieve seemed completely lost in thought .It .did that mean .What did that mean ?It meant said Dumbledore that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July nearly sixteen years ago .This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times .Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him .His breathing seemed difficult again .It means me ?Dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses .The odd thing is Harry he said softly that it may not have meant you at all .Sibylls prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys both born at the end of July that year both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times .One of course was you .The other was Neville Longbottom .But then .but then why was it my name on the prophecy and not Nevilles ?The official record was relabeled after Voldemort s attack on you as a child said Dumbledore .It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring .Then it might not be me ?said Harry .I am afraid said Dumbledore slowly looking as though every word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you .But you said Neville was born at the end of July too and his mum and dad You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort .Voldemort himself would ‘mark him as his equal .And so he did Harry .He chose you not Neville .He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse .But he might have chosen wrong !said Harry .He might have marked the wrong person !He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said Dumbledore .And notice this Harry .He chose not the pureblood which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the halfblood like himself .He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you and in marking you with that scar he did not kill you as he intended but gave you powers and a future which have fitted you to escape him not once but four times so far something that neither your parents nor Nevilles parents ever achieved .Why did he do it then ?said Harry who felt numb and cold .Why did he try and kill me as a baby ?He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then That might indeed have been the more practical course said Dumbledore except that Voldemorts information about the prophecy was incomplete .The Hogs Head Inn which Sibyll chose for its cheapness has long attracted shall we say a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks .As you and your friends found out to your cost and I to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard .Of course I had not dreamed when I set out to meet Sibyll Trelawney that I would hear anything worth overhearing .My our one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building .So he only heard . ?He heard only the first part the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort .Consequently he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you again marking you as his equal .So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you that it might be wise to wait or to learn more .He did not know that you would have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not But I dont !said Harry in a strangled voice .I havent any powers he hasnt got I couldnt fight the way he did tonight I cant possess people or or kill them There is a room in the Department of Mysteries interrupted Dumbledore that is kept locked at all times .It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than forces of nature .It is also perhaps the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there .It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all .That power took you to save Sirius tonight .That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests .In the end it mattered not that you could not close your mind .It was your heart that saved you .Harry closed his eyes .If he had not gone to save Sirius Sirius would not have died .More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again Harry asked without caring much about the answer The end of the prophecy .it was something about . ‘neither can live . ‘.while the other survives said Dumbledore .So said Harry dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him so does that mean that .that one of us has got to kill the other one .in the end ?Yes said Dumbledore .For a long time neither of them spoke .Somewhere far beyond the office walls Harry could hear the sound of voices students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast perhaps .It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food who laughed who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever .Sirius seemed a million miles away already even if a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil he would have found Sirius looking back at him greeting him perhaps with his laugh like a bark .I feel I owe you another explanation Harry said Dumbledore hesitantly .You may perhaps have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect ?I must confess .that I rather thought .you had enough responsibility to be going on with .Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore s face into his long silver beard .THE SECOND WAR BEGINS HEWHOMUSTNOTBENAMED RETURNS In a brief statement Friday night Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that HeWhoMustNotBe Named has returned to this country and is active once more .It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord well you know who I mean is alive and among us again said Fudge looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters .It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministrys employ .We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord Thingy .We urge the magical population to remain vigilant The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defense that will be delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the coming month .The Ministers statement was met with dismay and alarm from the Wizarding community which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that YouKnowWho is operating amongst us once more .Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed and a select band of followers known as Death Eaters gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening .Albus Dumbledore newly reinstated headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot was unavailable for comment last night .He has insisted for a year that YouKnowWho was not dead as was widely hoped and believed but recruiting followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize power .Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived There you are Harry I knew theyd drag you into it somehow said Hermione looking over the top of the paper at him .They were in the hospital wing .Harry was sitting on the end of Rons bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sunday Prophet .Ginny whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey was curled up at the foot of Hermiones bed Neville whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape was in a chair between the two beds and Luna who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler was reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying .Hes ‘the Boy Who Lived again now though isnt he ?said Ron darkly .Not such a showoff maniac anymore eh ?He helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to Harry Ginny and Neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth .There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brains tentacles had wrapped around him .According to Madam Pomfrey thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr .Ubblys Oblivious Unction there seemed to be some improvement .Yes theyre very complimentary about you now Harry said Hermione now scanning down the article . ‘A lone voice of truth .perceived as unbalanced yet never wavered in his story .forced to bear ridicule and slander .Hmmm said Hermione frowning I notice they dont mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering though .She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs .The curse Dolohov had used on her though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud had nevertheless caused in Madam Pomfreys words quite enough damage to be going on with .Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day and although she was improving greatly was already bored with the hospital wing . ‘YouKnow Whos Last Attempt to Take Over pages two to four What the Ministry Should Have Told Us page five Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore pages six to eight Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter page nine .Well said Hermione folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside its certainly given them lots to write about .And that interview with Harry isnt exclusive its the one that was in The Quibbler months ago .Daddy sold it to them said Luna vaguely turning a page of The Quibbler .He got a very good price for it too so were going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple Horned Snorkack .Hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment then said That sounds lovely .Ginny caught Harrys eye and looked away quickly grinning .So anyway said Hermione sitting up a little straighter and wincing again whats going on in school ?Well Flitwicks got rid of Fred and Georges swamp said Ginny .He did it in about three seconds .But he left a tiny patch under the window and hes roped it off Why ?said Hermione looking startled .Oh he just says it was a really good bit of magic said Ginny shrugging .I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George said Ron through a mouthful of chocolate .They sent me all these you know he told Harry pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him .Must be doing all right out of that joke shop eh ?Hermione looked rather disapproving and asked So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledores back ?Yes said Neville everythings settled right back down again .I spose Filch is happy is he ?asked Ron propping a Chocolate Frog card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug .Not at all said Ginny .Hes really really miserable actually .She lowered her voice to a whisper .He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts .All six of them looked around .Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them gazing up at the ceiling .Dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs .How he had done it how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him nobody knew and Umbridge was certainly not telling .Since she had returned to the castle she had not as far as any of them knew uttered a single word .Nobody really knew what was wrong with her either .Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed .Madam Pomfrey says shes just in shock whispered Hermione .Sulking more like said Ginny Yeah she shows signs of life if you do this said Ron and with his tongue he made soft clipclopping noises .Umbridge sat bolt upright looking wildly around .Anything wrong Professor ?called Madam Pomfrey poking her head around her office door .No .no .said Umbridge sinking back into her pillows no I must have been dreaming .Hermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes .Speaking of centaurs said Hermione when she had recovered a little whos Divination teacher now ?Is Firenze staying ?Hes got to said Harry the other centaurs wont take him back will they ?It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach said Ginny .Bet Dumbledore wishes he couldve got rid of Trelawney for good said Ron now munching on his fourteenth Frog .Mind you the whole subjects useless if you ask me Firenze isnt a lot better .How can you say that ?Hermione demanded .After weve just found out that there are real prophecies ?Harrys heart began to race .He had not told Ron Hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained .Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room and Harry had not yet corrected this impression .He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim there was no other way .It is a pity it broke said Hermione quietly shaking her head .Yeah it is said Ron .Still at least YouKnowWho never found out what was in it either where are you going ?he added looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up .Er Hagrids said Harry .You know he just got back and I promised Id go down and see him and tell him how you two are .Oh all right then said Ron grumpily looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond .Wish we could come .Say hello to him for us !called Hermione as Harry proceeded down the ward .And ask him whats happening about .about his little friend !Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory .The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday .Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or homework .Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor peering out of windows as he went .He could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake accompanied by the giant squid .He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not .Whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company .He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid though he had not talked to him properly since he had returned .Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room .Harry stopped dead so did Malfoy and the others .For a few moments the only sounds were the shouts laughter and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors .Malfoy glanced around .Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers .Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice Youre dead Potter .Harry raised his eyebrows .Funny he said youd think Id have stopped walking around .Malfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him .He felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale pointed face contorted with rage .Youre going to pay said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper .Im going to make you pay for what youve done to my father .Well Im terrified now said Harry sarcastically .I spose Lord Voldemorts just a warmup act compared to you three whats the matter ?he said for Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name .Hes your dads mate isnt he ?Not scared of him are you ?You think youre such a big man Potter said Malfoy advancing now Crabbe and Goyle flanking him .You wait .Ill have you .You cant land my father in prison I thought I just had said Harry .The dementors have left Azkaban said Malfoy quietly .Dad and the othersll be out in no time .Yeah I expect they will said Harry .Still at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now Malfoys hand flew toward his wand but Harry was too quick for him .He had drawn his own wand before Malfoys fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes .Potter !The voice rang across the entrance hall Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward Malfoy .Whatever Dumbledore said he would never forgive Snape .never .What are you doing Potter ?said Snape coldly as ever as he strode over to the four of them .Im trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy sir said Harry fiercely .Snape stared at him .Put that wand away at once he said curtly .Ten points from Gryff Snape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile .Ah .I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away .In that case Potter we will simply have to Add some more ?Professor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle .She was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other but otherwise looked quite well .Professor McGonagall !said Snape striding forward .Out of St .Mungos I see !Yes Professor Snape said Professor McGonagall shrugging off her traveling cloak Im quite as good as new .You two Crabbe Goyle She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came shuffling their large feet and looking awkward .Here said Professor McGonagall thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe s chest and her cloak into Goyles take these up to my office for me .They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase .Right then said Professor McGonagall looking up at the hourglasses on the wall well I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You Know Who !What say you Professor Snape ?What ?snapped Snape though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well .Oh well I suppose .So thats fifty each for Potter the two Weasleys Longbottom and Miss Granger said Professor McGonagall and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindors hourglass as she spoke .Oh and fifty for Miss Lovegood I suppose she added and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaws glass .Now you wanted to take ten from Mr Potter I think Professor Snape so there we are .A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless .Well Potter Malfoy I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this Professor McGonagall continued briskly .Harry did not need telling twice .He thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy .The hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns toward Hagrids cabin .Students lying around on the grass sunbathing talking reading the Sunday Prophet and eating sweets looked up at him as he passed .Some called out to him or else waved clearly eager to show that they like the Prophet had decided he was something of a hero .Harry said nothing to any of them .He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way .He thought at first when he knocked on Hagrids cabin door that he was out but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome .Hagrid it transpired was picking runner beans in his back garden .All righ Harry !he said beaming when Harry approached the fence .Come in come in well have a cup o dandelion juice .Hows things ?Hagrid asked him as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice .You er feelin all righ are yeh ?Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrids face that he was not referring to Harrys physical well being .Im fine Harry said quickly because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrids mind .So whereve you been ?Bin hidin out in the mountains said Hagrid .Up in a cave like Sirius did when he Hagrid broke off cleared his throat gruffly looked at Harry and took a long draft of juice .Anyway back now he said feebly .You you look better said Harry who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius .Wha ?said Hagrid raising a massive hand and feeling his face .Oh oh yeah .Well Grawpys loads better behaved now loads .Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back ter tell yeh the truth .Hes a good lad really .Ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend actually .Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once .The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp was positively alarming but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point .He was starting to wish he was alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice half emptying his glass .Evryone knows youve bin tellin the truth now Harry said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly .Thas gotta be better hasn it ?Harry shrugged .Look .Hagrid leaned toward him across the table I knew Sirius longer n you did .He died in battle an thas the way hedve wanted ter go He didnt want to go at all !said Harry angrily .Hagrid bowed his great shaggy head .Nah I don reckon he did he said quietly .But still Harry .he was never one ter sit around at home an let other people do the fightin .He couldn have lived with himself if he hadn gone ter help Harry leapt up again .Ive got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing he said mechanically .Oh said Hagrid looking rather upset .Oh .all righ then Harry .Take care of yerself then an drop back in if yehve got a mo .Yeah .right .Harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open .He was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn .Once again people called out to him as he passed .He closed his eyes for a few moments wishing they would all vanish that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds .A few days ago before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind he would have given almost anything for the Wizarding world to know that he had been telling the truth for them to believe that Voldemort was back and know that he was neither a liar nor mad .Now however .He walked a short way around the lake sat down on its bank sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs and stared out over the gleaming water thinking .Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore .An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world .He was he had always been a marked man .It was just that he had never really understood what that meant .And yet sitting here on the edge of the lake with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside he could not muster any great sense of fear .It was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include or end in murder .He sat there for a long time gazing out at the water trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here on the opposite bank that Sirius had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors .The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold .He got up and returned to the castle wiping his face on his sleeve as he went .Ron and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term .Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius but Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name .Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet his wishes varied with his mood .He knew one thing though Unhappy as he felt at the moment he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days time when he was back at number four Privet Drive .Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer he did not feel any better about it .Indeed he had never dreaded his return more .Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term .It seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime evidently hoping to depart undetected but unfortunately for her she met Peeves on the way who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk .Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheartedly to restrain their pupils .Indeed Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick .Their last evening at school arrived most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the endofterm feast but Harry had not even started .Just do it tomorrow !said Ron who was waiting by the door of their dormitory .Come on Im starving .I wont be long .Look you go ahead .But when the dormitory door closed behind Ron Harry made no effort to speed up his packing .The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the end ofterm feast .He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech .He was sure to mention Voldemorts return he had talked to them about it last year after all .Harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and as he did so noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it .He could not think what it was doing there .He bent down pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it .He realized what it was within seconds .Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place .Use it if you need me all right ?Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package .Out fell a small square mirror .It looked old it was certainly dirty .Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him .He turned the mirror over .There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius .This is a twoway mirror .Ive got the other .If you need to speak to me just say my name into it youll appear in my mirror and Ill be able to talk in yours .James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions .And Harrys heart began to race .He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago .He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again right now he knew it He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there the dormitory was quite empty .He looked back at the mirror raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said loudly and clearly Sirius .His breath misted the surface of the glass .He held the mirror even closer excitement flooding through him but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own .He wiped the mirror clear again and said so that every syllable rang clearly through the room Sirius Black !Nothing happened .The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still definitely his own .Sirius didnt have his mirror on him when he went through the archway said a small voice in Harrys head .Thats why its not working .Harry remained quite still for a moment then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered .He had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he was going to see Sirius talk to him again .Disappointment was burning in his throat .He got up and began throwing his things pellmell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror But then an idea struck him .A better idea than a mirror .A much bigger more important idea .How had he never thought of it before why had he never asked ?He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing .He hurtled across the empty common room through the portrait hole and off along the corridor ignoring the Fat Lady who called after him The feast is about to start you know youre cutting it very fine !But Harry had no intention of going to the feast .How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didnt need one yet now .He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead .They were all clearly in the Great Hall .Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast .But just as he had given up hope he saw it a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor .Hey hey Nick !NICK !The ghost stuck its head back out of the wall revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington .Good evening he said withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry .I am not the only one who is late then ?Though he sighed in rather different senses of course .Nick can I ask you something ?A most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nicks face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter apparently to give himself thinking time .He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely .Er now Harry ?said Nick looking discomforted .Cant it wait until after the feast ?No Nick please said Harry I really need to talk to you .Can we go in here ?Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed .Oh very well he said looking resigned .I cant pretend I havent been expecting it .Harry was holding the door open for him but he drifted through the wall instead .Expecting what ?Harry asked as he closed the door .You to come and find me said Nick now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds .It happens sometimes .when somebody has suffered a .loss .Well said Harry refusing to be deflected .You were right Ive Ive come to find you .Nick said nothing .Its said Harry who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated its just youre dead .But youre still here arent you ?Nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds .Thats right isnt it ?Harry urged him .You died but Im talking to you .You can walk around Hogwarts and everything cant you ?Yes said Nearly Headless Nick quietly I walk and talk yes .So you came back didnt you ?said Harry urgently .People can come back right ?As ghosts .They dont have to disappear completely .Well ?he added impatiently when Nick continued to say nothing .Nearly Headless Nick hesitated then said Not everyone can come back as a ghost .What dyou mean ?said Harry quickly .Only .only wizards .Oh said Harry and he almost laughed with relief .Well thats okay then the person Im asking about is a wizard .So he can come back right ?Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry .He wont come back .Who ?Sirius Black said Nick .But you did !said Harry angrily .You came back youre dead and you didnt disappear Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth to walk palely where their living selves once trod said Nick miserably .But very few wizards choose that path .Why not ?said Harry .Anyway it doesnt matter Sirius wont care if its unusual hell come back I know he will !And so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to check the door sure for a split second that he was going to see Sirius pearly white and transparent but beaming walking through it toward him .He will not come back repeated Nick quietly .He will have .gone on .What dyou mean ‘gone on ?said Harry quickly .Gone on where ?Listen what happens when you die anyway ?Where do you go ?Why doesnt everyone come back ?Why isnt this place full of ghosts ?Why ?I cannot answer said Nick .Youre dead arent you ?said Harry exasperatedly .Who can answer better than you ?I was afraid of death said Nick .I chose to remain behind .I sometimes wonder whether I oughtnt to have .Well that is neither here nor there .In fact I am neither here nor there .He gave a small sad chuckle .I know nothing of the secrets of death Harry for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead .I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries Dont talk to me about that place !said Harry fiercely .I am sorry not to have been more help said Nick gently .Well .well do excuse me .the feast you know .And he left the room leaving Harry there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared .Harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more .He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again .He had turned the corner toward the Fat Ladys corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall .A second glance showed him that it was Luna .There were no good hiding places nearby she was bound to have heard his footsteps and in any case Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment .Hello said Luna vaguely glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice .How come youre not at the feast ?Harry asked .Well Ive lost most of my possessions said Luna serenely .People take them and hide them you know .But as its the last night I really do need them back so Ive been putting up signs .She gestured toward the notice board upon which sure enough she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes with a plea for their return .An odd feeling rose in Harry an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Siriuss death .It was a few moments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna .How come people hide your stuff ?he asked her frowning .Oh .well .She shrugged .I think they think Im a bit odd you know .Some people call me ‘Loony Lovegood actually .Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully .Thats no reason for them to take your things he said flatly .Dyou want help finding them ?Oh no she said smiling at him .Theyll come back they always do in the end .It was just that I wanted to pack tonight .Anyway .why arent you at the feast ?Harry shrugged .Just didnt feel like it .No said Luna observing him with those oddly misty protuberant eyes .I dont suppose you do .That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather wasnt he ?Ginny told me .Harry nodded curtly but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius .He had just remembered that she too could see thestrals .Have you .he began .I mean who .has anyone youve known ever died ?Yes said Luna simply my mother .She was a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day .I was nine .Im sorry Harry mumbled .Yes it was rather horrible said Luna conversationally .I still feel very sad about it sometimes .But Ive still got Dad .And anyway its not as though Ill never see Mum again is it ?Er isnt it ?said Harry uncertainly .She shook her head in disbelief .Oh come on .You heard them just behind the veil didnt you ?You mean .In that room with the archway .They were just lurking out of sight thats all .You heard them .They looked at each other .Luna was smiling slightly .Harry did not know what to say or to think .Luna believed so many extraordinary things .yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil too .Are you sure you dont want me to help you look for your stuff ?he said .Oh no said Luna .No I think Ill just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up .It always does in the end .Well have a nice holiday Harry .Yeah .yeah you too .She walked away from him and as he watched her go he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly .The journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways .Firstly Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet .The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D .A .members who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harrys aid .By the time Ernie Macmillan Hannah Abbott Susan Bones Justin Page llOOHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J .K .FinchFletchley Anthony Goldstein and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry Ernie and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze .I must say Im looking forward to seeing Malfoys mothers face when he gets off the train said Ernie with some satisfaction as he watched Malfoy squirm above him .Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad .Goyles mumll be really pleased though said Ron who had come to investigate the source of the commotion .Hes loads betterlooking now .Anyway Harry the food trolleys just stopped if you want anything .Harry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties .Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched .Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning .Page llOlHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix J .K .It hasnt really started yet sighed Hermione gloomily folding up the newspaper again .But it wont be long now .Hey Harry said Ron nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor .Harry looked around .Cho was passing accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe who was wearing a balaclava .His and Chos eyes met for a moment .Cho blushed and kept walking .Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Rons knight .Whats er going on with you and her anyway ?Ron asked quietly .Nothing said Harry truthfully .I er heard shes going out with someone else now said Hermione tentatively .Harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all .Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him .So much of what he had wanted before Siriuss death felt that way these days .The week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much much longer It stretched across two universes the one with Sirius in it and the one without .Youre well out of it mate said Ron forcefully .I mean shes quite goodlooking and all that but you want someone a bit more cheerful .Shes probably cheerful enough with someone else said Harry shrugging .Whos she with now anyway ?Ron asked Hermione but it was Ginny who answered .Michael Corner she said .Michael but said Ron craning around in his seat to stare at her .But you were going out with him !Not anymore said Ginny resolutely .He didnt like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead .She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned The Quibbler upside down and began marking her answers .Ron looked highly delighted .Well I always thought he was a bit of an idiot he said prodding his queen forward toward Harrys quivering castle .Good for you .Just choose someone better next time .He cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it .Well Ive chosen Dean Thomas would you say hes better ?asked Ginny vaguely .WHAT ?shouted Ron upending the chessboard .Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead .As the train slowed down in the approach to Kings Cross Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less .He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September when it would take him back to Hogwarts .When it finally puffed to a standstill however he lifted down Hedwigs cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual .When the ticket inspector signaled to him Ron and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten however he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not expected at all .There was MadEye Moody looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it his gnarled hands clutching a long staff his body wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak .Tonks stood just behind him her bright bubblegumpink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass station ceiling wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple Tshirt bearing the legend THE WEIRD SISTERS .Next to Tonks was Lupin his face pale his hair graying a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers .At the front of the group stood Mr and Mrs Weasley dressed in their Muggle best and Fred and George who were both wearing brandnew jackets in some lurid green scaly material .Ron Ginny !called Mrs Weasley hurrying forward and hugging her children tightly .Oh and Harry dear how are you ?Fine lied Harry as she pulled him into a tight embrace .Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins new clothes .What are they supposed to be ?he asked pointing at the jackets .Finest dragon skin little bro said Fred giving his zip a little tweak .Business is booming and we thought wed treat ourselves .Hello Harry said Lupin as Mrs Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione .Hi said Harry .I didnt expect .what are you all doing here ?Well said Lupin with a slight smile we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home .I dunno if thats a good idea said Harry at once .Oh I think it is growled Moody who had limped a little closer .Thatll be them will it Potter ?He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat .Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where MadEye was pointing and there sure enough were the three Dursleys who looked positively appalled to see Harrys reception committee .Ah Harry !said Mr Weasley turning from Hermiones parents whom he had been greeting enthusiastically and who were taking it in turns to hug Hermione .Well shall we do it then ?Yeah I reckon so Arthur said Moody .He and Mr Weasley took the lead across the station toward the place where the Dursleys stood apparently rooted to the floor .Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group .Good afternoon said Mr Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon coming to a halt right in front of him .You might remember me my names Arthur Weasley .As Mr Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys living room two years previously Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him .Sure enough Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr Weasley but chose not to say anything partly perhaps because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one .Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed .She kept glancing around as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company .Dudley meanwhile seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant a feat at which he was failing extravagantly .We thought wed just have a few words with you about Harry said Mr Weasley still smiling .Yeah growled Moody .About how hes treated when hes at your place .Uncle Vernons mustache seemed to bristle with indignation .Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit he addressed himself to Moody .I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house I expect what youre not aware of would fill several books Dursley growled Moody .Anyway thats not the point interjected Tonks whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together for she closed her eyes rather than look at her .The point is if we find out youve been horrible to Harry and make no mistake well hear about it added Lupin pleasantly .Yes said Mr Weasley even if you wont let Harry use the fellytone Telephone whispered Hermione .Yeah if we get any hint that Potters been mistreated in any way youll have us to answer to said Moody .Uncle Vernon swelled ominously .His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs .Are you threatening me sir ?he said so loudly that passersby actually turned to stare .Yes I am said MadEye who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly .And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated ?barked Uncle Vernon .Well .said Moody pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye .Uncle Vernon leapt backward in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley .Yes Id have to say you do Dursley .He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry .So Potter .give us a shout if you need us .If we dont hear from you for three days in a row well send someone along .Aunt Petunia whimpered piteously .It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path .T3ye then Potter said Moody grasping Harrys shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand .Take care Harry said Lupin quietly .Keep in touch .Harry well have you away from there as soon as we can Mrs Weasley whispered hugging him again .Well see you soon mate said Ron anxiously shaking Harrys hand .Really soon Harry said Hermione earnestly .We promise .Harry nodded .He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him to see them all ranged there on his side .Instead he smiled raised a hand in farewell turned around and led the way out of the station toward the sunlit street with Uncle Vernon Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake .J THE OTHER MINISTER It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind .He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there was not much space in his head for anything else .The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents .This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week as though anyone needed reminding but also to explain why each and every one of them was the governments fault .The Prime Ministers pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations for they were neither fair nor true .How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing ?It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges .The bridge was fewer than ten years old and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below .And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and wellpublicized murders ?Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property ?And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers Herbert Chorley had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family ?A grim mood has gripped the country the opponent had concluded barely concealing his own broad grin .And unfortunately this was perfectly true .The Prime Minister felt it himself people really did seem more miserable than usual .Even the weather was dismal all this chilly mist in the middle of July .It wasnt right it wasnt normal .He turned over the second page of the memo saw how much longer it went on and gave it up as a bad job .Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully .It was a handsome room with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows firmly closed against the unseasonable chill .With a slight shiver the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass .It was then as he stood with his back to the room that he heard a soft cough behind him .He froze nose to nose with his own scaredlooking reflection in the dark glass .He knew that cough .He had heard it before .He turned very slowly to face the empty room .Hello ?he said trying to sound braver than he felt .For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him .However a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement .It was coming as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room .To the Prime Minister of Muggles .Urgent we meet .Kindly respond immediately .Sincerely Fudge .The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister .Er said the Prime Minister listen .Its not a very good time for me .Im waiting for a telephone call you see .from the President of That can be rearranged said the portrait at once .The Prime Ministers heart sank .He had been afraid of that .But I really was rather hoping to speak We shall arrange for the President to forget to call .He will telephone tomorrow night instead said the little man .Kindly respond immediately to Mr Fudge .I .oh .very well said the Prime Minister weakly .Yes Ill see Fudge .He hurried back to his desk straightening his tie as he went .He had barely resumed his seat and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece .He watched trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm as a portly man appeared within the flames spinning as fast as a top .Seconds later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pinstriped cloak a limegreen bowler hat in his hand .Ah .Prime Minister said Cornelius Fudge striding forward with his hand outstretched .Good to see you again .The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all .He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge whose occasional appearances apart from being downright alarming in themselves generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news .Furthermore Fudge was looking distinctly careworn .He was thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look .The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before and it never boded well .How can I help you ?he said shaking Fudges hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk .Difficult to know where to begin muttered Fudge pulling up the chair sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knees .What a week what a week .Had a bad one too have you ?asked the Prime Minister stiffly hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge .Yes of course said Fudge rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister .Ive been having the same week you have Prime Minister .The Brockdale Bridge .the Bones and Vance murders .not to mention the ruckus in the West Country .You er your I mean to say some of your people were were involved in those those things were they ?Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look .Of course they were he said .Surely youve realized whats going on ?I .hesitated the Prime Minister .It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudges visits so much .He was after all the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy .But of course it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister .He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day .He had been standing alone in this very office savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself .Naturally he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad .He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfproclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand .He had remained speechless throughout Fudges kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical population from getting wind of them .It was said Fudge a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point .Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the stilldumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way .Not to worry he had said its oddson youll never see me again .Ill only bother you if theres something really serious going on our end something thats likely to affect the Muggles the nonmagical population I should say .Otherwise its live and let live .And I must say youre taking it a lot better than your predecessor .He tried to throw me out the window thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition .At this the Prime Minister had found his voice at last .Youre youre not a hoax then ?It had been his last desperate hope .No said Fudge gently .No Im afraid Im not .Look .And he had turned the Prime Ministers teacup into a gerbil .But said the Prime Minister breathlessly watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech but why why has nobody told me ?The Minister of Magic only reveals him or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day said Fudge poking his wand back inside his jacket .We find it the best way to maintain secrecy .But then bleated the Prime Minister why hasnt a former Prime Minister warned me ?At this Fudge had actually laughed .My dear Prime Minister are you ever going to tell anybody ?Still chortling Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace stepped into the emerald flames and vanished with a whooshing sound .The Prime Minister had stood there quite motionless and realized that he would never as long as he lived dare mention this encounter to a living soul for who in the wide world would believe him ?The shock had taken a little while to wear off .For a time he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign .In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudges arrival .To the Prime Ministers dismay however the portrait had proved impossible to remove .When several carpenters a builder or two an art historian and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office .Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning or else scratching his nose even once or twice simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind .However he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened .Then three years ago on a night very like tonight the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge who had burst out of the fireplace sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic .Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of a man named Serious Black something that sounded like Hogwarts and a boy called Harry Potter none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister . .Fve just come from Azkaban Fudge had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket .Middle of the North Sea you know nasty flight .the dementors are in uproar he shuddered theyve never had a breakout before .Anyway I had to come to you Prime Minister .Blacks a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin YouKnowWho .But of course you dont even know who YouKnowWho is !He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment then said Well sit down sit down Id better fill you in .Have a whiskey .The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office let alone offered his own whiskey but he sat nevertheless .Fudge pulled out his wand conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air pushed one of them into the Prime Ministers hand and drew up a chair .Fudge had talked for more than an hour .At one point he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment which he had thrust into the Prime Ministers whiskeyfree hand .When at last Fudge had stood up to leave the Prime Minister had stood up too .So you think that .He had squinted down at the name in his left hand .Lord Vol HeWhoMustNotBeNamed snarled Fudge .Im sorry .You think that HeWhoMustNotBe Named is still alive then ?Well Dumbledore says he is said Fudge as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin but weve never found him .If you ask me hes not dangerous unless hes got support so its Black we ought to be worrying about .Youll put out that warning then ?Excellent .Well I hope we dont see each other again Prime Minister !Good night .But they had seen each other again .Less than a year later a harassedlooking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch or that was what it had sounded like World Cup and that several Muggles had been involved but that the Prime Minister was not to worry the fact that YouKnow Whos Mark had been seen again meant nothing Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke .Oh and I almost forgot Fudge had added .Were importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament quite routine but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that its down in the rule book that we have to notify you if were bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country .I what dragons ?spluttered the Prime Minister .Yes three said Fudge .And a sphinx .Well good day to you .The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it but no .Less than two years later Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban .A mass breakout ?repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely .No need to worry no need to worry !shouted Fudge already with one foot in the flames .Well have them rounded up in no time just thought you ought to know !And before the Prime Minister could shout Now wait just one moment !Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks .Whatever the press and the opposition might say the Prime Minister was not a foolish man .It had not escaped his notice that despite Fudges assurances at their first meeting they were now seeing rather a lot of each other nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit .Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic or as he always called Fudge in his head the Other Minister the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still .The sight therefore of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week .How should I know whats going on in the er Wizarding community ?snapped the Prime Minister now .I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without We have the same concerns Fudge interrupted .The Brockdale Bridge didnt wear out .That wasnt really a hurricane .Those murders were not the work of Muggles .And Herbert Chorleys family would be safer without him .We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St .Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries .The move should be effected tonight .What do you .Im afraid I .What ?blustered the Prime Minister .Fudge took a great deep breath and said Prime Minister I am very sorry to have to tell you that hes back .HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is back .Back ?When you say ‘back .hes alive ?I mean The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier .Yes alive said Fudge .That is I dont know is a man alive if he cant be killed ?I dont really understand it and Dumbledore wont explain properly but anyway hes certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing so I suppose for the purposes of our discussion yes hes alive .The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations .Is Serious Black with er HeWhoMustNotBe Named ?Black ?Black ?said Fudge distractedly turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers .Sirius Black you mean ?Merlins beard no .Blacks dead .Turns out we were er mistaken about Black .He was innocent after all .And he wasnt in league with HeWhoMust NotBeNamed either .I mean he added defensively spinning the bowler hat still faster all the evidence pointed we had more than fifty eyewitnesses but anyway as I say hes dead .Murdered as a matter of fact .On Ministry of Magic premises .Theres going to be an inquiry actually .To his great surprise the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point .It was however eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge .Not yet anyway .While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk Fudge continued But Blacks by theby now .The point is were at war Prime Minister and steps must be taken .At war ?repeated the Prime Minister nervously .Surely thats a little bit of an overstatement ?HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January said Fudge speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a limegreen blur .Since they have moved into the open they have been wreaking havoc .The Brockdale Bridge he did it Prime Minister he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and Good grief so its your fault those people were killed and Im having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I dont know what else !said the Prime Minister furiously .My fault !said Fudge coloring up .Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that ?Maybe not said the Prime Minister standing up and striding about the room but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity !Do you really think I wasnt already making every effort ?demanded Fudge heatedly .Every Auror in the Ministry was and is trying to find him and round up his followers but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades !So I suppose youre going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too ?said the Prime Minister his temper rising with every pace he took .It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public almost worse than it being the governments fault after all .That was no hurricane said Fudge miserably .Excuse me !barked the Prime Minister now positively stamping up and down .Trees uprooted roofs ripped off lampposts bent horrible injuries It was the Death Eaters said Fudge .HeWhoMust NotBeNameds followers .And .and we suspect giant involvement .The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall .What involvement ?Fudge grimaced .He used giants last time when he wanted to go for the grand effect he said .The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock weve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened weve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset but we cant find the giant its been a disaster .You dont say !said the Prime Minister furiously .I wont deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry said Fudge .What with all that and then losing Amelia Bones .Losing who ?Amelia Bones .Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement .We think HeWhoMustNotBe Named may have murdered her in person because she was a very gifted witch and and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight .Fudge cleared his throat and with an effort it seemed stopped spinning his bowler hat .But that murder was in the newspapers said the Prime Minister momentarily diverted from his anger .Our newspapers .Amelia Bones .it just said she was a middleaged woman who lived alone .It was a a nasty killing wasnt it ?Its had rather a lot of publicity .The police are baffled you see .Fudge sighed .Well of course they are he said .Killed in a room that was locked from the inside wasnt she ?We on the other hand know exactly who did it not that that gets us any further toward catching him .And then there was Emmeline Vance maybe you didnt hear about that one Oh yes I did !said the Prime Minister .It happened just around the corner from here as a matter of fact .The papers had a field day with it ‘breakdown of law and order in the Prime Ministers backyard And as if all that wasnt enough said Fudge barely listening to the Prime Minister weve got dementors swarming all over the place attacking people left right and center .Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister but he was wiser now .I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban he said cautiously .They did said Fudge wearily .But not anymore .Theyve deserted the prison and joined HeWhoMust NotBeNamed .I wont pretend that wasnt a blow .But said the Prime Minister with a sense of dawning horror didnt you tell me theyre the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people ?Thats right .And theyre breeding .Thats whats causing all this mist .The Prime Minister sank weakkneed into the nearest chair .The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters made him feel quite faint .Now see here Fudge youve got to do something !Its your responsibility as Minister of Magic !My dear Prime Minister you cant honestly think Im still Minister of Magic after all this ?I was sacked three days ago !The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight .Ive never known them so united in my whole term of office !said Fudge with a brave attempt at a smile .The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words .Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed he still rather felt for the shrunken looking man sitting opposite him .Im very sorry he said finally .If theres anything I can do ?Its very kind of you Prime Minister but there is nothing .I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor .I rather thought hed be here by now but of course hes very busy at the moment with so much going on .Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill .Catching Fudges eye the portrait said Hell be here in a moment hes just finishing a letter to Dumbledore .I wish him luck said Fudge sounding bitter for the first time .Ive been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight but he wont budge .If hed just been prepared to persuade the boy I might still be .Well maybe Scrimgeour will have more success .Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait which suddenly spoke in its crisp official voice .To the Prime Minister of Muggles .Requesting a meeting .Urgent .Kindly respond immediately .Rufus Scrimgeour Minister of Magic .Yes yes fine said the Prime Minister distractedly and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again rose up and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug .Fudge got to his feet and after a moments hesitation the Prime Minister did the same watching the new arrival straighten up dust down his long black robes and look around .The Prime Ministers first foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion .There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wirerimmed spectacles and a certain rangy loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp .There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times .How do you do ?said the Prime Minister politely holding out his hand .Scrimgeour grasped it briefly his eyes scanning the room then pulled out a wand from under his robes .Fudge told you everything ?he asked striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand .The Prime Minister heard the lock click .Er yes said the Prime Minister .And if you dont mind Id rather that door remained unlocked .Id rather not be interrupted said Scrimgeour shortly or watched he added pointing his wand at the windows so that the curtains swept across them .Right well Im a busy man so lets get down to business .First of all we need to discuss your security .The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied I am perfectly happy with the security Ive already got thank you very Well were not Scrimgeour cut in .Itll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse .The new secretary in your outer office ‘Tm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt if thats what youre suggesting !said the Prime Minister hotly .Hes highly efficient gets through twice the work the rest of them Thats because hes a wizard said Scrimgeour without a flicker of a smile .A highly trained Auror who has been assigned to you for your protection .Now wait a moment !declared the Prime Minister .You cant just put your people into my office I decide who works for me I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt ?said Scrimgeour coldly .I am thats to say I was Then theres no problem is there ?said Scrimgeour .I .well as long as Shacklebolts work continues to be .er .excellent said the Prime Minister lamely but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him .Now about Herbert Chorley your Junior Minister he continued .The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck .What about him ?asked the Prime Minister .He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse said Scrimgeour .Its addled his brains but he could still be dangerous .Hes only quacking !said the Prime Minister weakly .Surely a bit of a rest .Maybe go easy on the drink A team of Healers from St .Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak .So far he has attempted to strangle three of them said Scrimgeour .I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while .I .well .Hell be all right wont he ?said the Prime Minister anxiously .Scrimgeour merely shrugged already moving back toward the fireplace .Well thats really all I had to say .I will keep you posted of developments Prime Minister or at least I shall probably be too busy to come personally in which case I shall send Fudge here .He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity .Fudge attempted to smile but was unsuccessful he merely looked as though he had a toothache .Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green .The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last .But for heavens sake youre wizards .You can do magic !Surely you can sort out well anything !Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly The trouble is the other side can do magic too Prime Minister .And with that the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished .SPINNERS END Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Ministers windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown rubbish strewn banks .An immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous .There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fishandchip wrappings in the tall grass .But then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river .The fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon .The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass .With a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized .Wait !The harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth .It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank .There was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead .The second figure turned over the animal with its toe .Just a fox said a womans voice dismissively from under the hood .I thought perhaps an Auror Cissy wait !But her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down .Cissy Narcissa listen to me The second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away .Go back Bella !You must listen to me !Ive listened already .Ive made my decision .Leave me alone !The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street .The other woman Bella followed at once .Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness .He lives here ?asked Bella in a voice of contempt .Here ?In this Muggle dunghill ?We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot But Narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road .Cissy wait Bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street .Some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness .The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other .Cissy you must not do this you cant trust him The Dark Lord trusts him doesnt he ?The Dark Lord is .I believe .mistaken Bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone .In any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone .This is a betrayal of the Dark Lords Let go Bella !snarled Narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the others face .Bella merely laughed .Cissy your own sister ?You wouldnt There is nothing I wouldnt do anymore !Narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light .Bella let go of her sisters arm as though burned .Narcisscd But Narcissa had rushed ahead .Rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses .At last Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinners End over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger .Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room .She had knocked on the door before Bella cursing under her breath had caught up .Together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze .After a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack .A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes .Narcissa threw back her hood .She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person .Narcissa !said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too .What a pleasant surprise !Severus she said in a strained whisper .May I speak to you ?Its urgent .But of course .He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house .Her stillhooded sister followed without invitation .Snape she said curtly as she passed him .Bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them .They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell .The walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candlefilled lamp hung from the ceiling .The place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited .Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa .She threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap .Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly .Dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa .So what can I do for you ?Snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters .We .we are alone arent we ?Narcissa asked quietly .Yes of course .Well Wormtails here but were not counting vermin are we ?He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen .As you have clearly realized Wormtail we have guests said Snape lazily .The man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room .He had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper .His left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove .Narcissa !he said in a squeaky voice .And Bellatrix !How charming Wormtail will get us drinks if youd like them said Snape .And then he will return to his bedroom .Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him .I am not your servant !he squeaked avoiding Snape s eye .Really ?I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me .To assist yes but not to make you drinks and and clean your house !I had no idea Wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said Snape silkily .This can be easily arranged I shall speak to the Dark Lord I can speak to him myself if I want to !Of course you can said Snape sneering .But in the meantime bring us drinks .Some of the elfmade wine will do .Wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door .They heard banging and a clinking of glasses .Within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray .He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the bookcovered door behind him .Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters .Narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst Bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at Snape .This did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused .The Dark Lord he said raising his glass and draining it .The sisters copied him .Snape refilled their glasses .As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush Severus Im sorry to come here like this but I had to see you .I think you are the only one who can help me Snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door .There was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs .My apologies said Snape .He has lately taken to listening at doors I dont know what he means by it . .You were saying Narcissa ?She took a great shuddering breath and started again .Severus I know I ought not to be here I have been told to say nothing to anyone but Then you ought to hold your tongue !snarled Bellatrix .Particularly in present company ! ‘Present company ?repeated Snape sardonically .And what am I to understand by that Bellatrix ?That I dont trust you Snape as you very well know !Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands .Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into Bellatrixs glowering face .Narcissa I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions .Well continue Bellatrix said Snape .Why is it that you do not trust me ?A hundred reasons !she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table .Where to start !Where were you when the Dark Lord fell ?Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished ?What have you been doing all these years that youve lived in Dumbledores pocket ?Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerers Stone ?Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn ?Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord ?And why Snape is Harry Potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years ?She paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks .Behind her Narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands .Snape smiled .Before I answer you oh yes Bellatrix I am going to answer !You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord !Before I answer you I say let me ask a question in turn .Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions ?And do you really think that had I not been able to give satisfactory answers I would be sitting here talking to you ?She hesitated .I know he believes you but .You think he is mistaken ?Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him ?Fooled the Dark Lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen ?Bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited .Snape did not press the point .He picked up his drink again sipped it and continued You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell .I was where he had ordered me to be at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore .You know I presume that it was on the Dark Lords orders that I took up the post ?She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but Snape forestalled her .You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished .For the same reason that Avery Yaxley the Carrows Greyback Lucius he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him .I believed him finished .I am not proud of it I was wrong but there it is .If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left .Hed have me !said Bellatrix passionately .I who spent many years in Azkaban for him !Yes indeed most admirable said Snape in a bored voice .Of course you werent a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine Gesture !she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad .While I endured the dementors you remained at Hogwarts comfortably playing Dumbledores pet !Not quite said Snape calmly .He wouldnt give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job you know .Seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse .tempt me into my old ways .This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord not to teach your favorite subject ?she jeered .Why did you stay there all that time Snape ?Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead ?Hardly said Snape although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful welcomeback present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is .But you stayed Yes Bellatrix I stayed said Snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time .I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban .They were rounding up the Death Eaters you know .Dumbledores protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and I used it .I repeat The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed so I do not see why you do .I think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerers Stone .That is easily answered .He did not know whether he could trust me .He thought like you that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledores stooge .He was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard .He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry .I deeply regret that he did not trust me .He would have returned to power three years sooner .As it was I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and I admit I did all I could to thwart him .Bellatrixs mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine .But you didnt return when he came back you didnt fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn Correct .I returned two hours later .I returned on Dumbledores orders .On Dumbledores ?she began in tones of outrage .Think !said Snape impatient again .Think !By waiting two hours just two hours I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy !By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lords side because I was ordered to I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since !Consider Bellatrix The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months .I knew he must be about to return all the Death Eaters knew !I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like Karkaroff didnt I ?The Dark Lords initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely I assure you when I explained that I remained faithful although Dumbledore thought I was his man .Yes the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever but he was wrong .But what use have you been ?sneered Bellatrix .What useful information have we had from you ?My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord said Snape .If he chooses not to share it with you He shares everything with me !said Bellatrix firing up at once .He calls me his most loyal his most faithful Does he ?said Snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief .Does he still after the fiasco at the Ministry ?That was not my fault !said Bellatrix flushing .The Dark Lord has in the past entrusted me with his most precious if Lucius hadnt Dont you dare dont you dare blame my husband !said Narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister .There is no point apportioning blame said Snape smoothly .What is done is done .But not by you !said Bellatrix furiously .No you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not Snape ?My orders were to remain behind said Snape .Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix ?And forgive me you speak of dangers .you were facing six teenagers were you not ?They were joined as you very well know by half of the Order before long !snarled Bellatrix .And while we are on the subject of the Order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters dont you ?I am not the SecretKeeper I cannot speak the name of the place .You understand how the enchantment works I think ?The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order .It led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black though I give you full credit for finishing him off .He inclined his head and toasted her .Her expression did not soften .You are avoiding my last question Snape .Harry Potter .You could have killed him at any point in the past five years .You have not done it .Why ?Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord ?asked Snape .He .lately we .I am asking you Snape !If I had murdered Harry Potter the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible You claim you foresaw his use of the boy !she jeered .I do not claim it I had no idea of his plans I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead .I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived at least until a year ago .But why did you keep him alive ?Have you not understood me ?It was only Dumbledores protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban !Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me ?But there was more to it than that .I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard which was how he had survived the Dark Lords attack .Indeed many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more .I was curious I admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle .Of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all .He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends .He is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and selfsatisfied as was his father before him .I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts where I believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me ?I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand .And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you ?asked Bellatrix .He has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still ?I have played my part well said Snape .And you overlook Dumbledores greatest weakness He has to believe the best of people .I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff fresh from my Death Eater days and he embraced me with open arms though as I say never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help .Dumbledore has been a great wizard oh yes he has for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise the Dark Lord acknowledges it .I am pleased to say however that Dumbledore is growing old .The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him .He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were .But through all these years he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord .Bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next .Taking advantage of her silence Snape turned to her sister .Now .you came to ask me for help Narcissa ?Narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair .Yes Severus .I I think you are the only one who can help me I have nowhere else to turn .Lucius is in jail and .She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids .The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it Narcissa continued her eyes still closed .He wishes none to know of the plan .It is .very secret .But If he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said Snape at once .The Dark Lords word is law .Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water .Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house .There !she said triumphantly to her sister .Even Snape says so You were told not to talk so hold your silence !But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk .He turned around to face Narcissa frowning .It so happens that I know of the plan he said in a low voice .I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told .Nevertheless had I not been in on the secret Narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord .I thought you must know about it !said Narcissa breathing more freely .He trusts you so Severus .You know about the plan ?said Bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage .You know ?Certainly said Snape .But what help do you require Narcissa ?If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind I am afraid there is no hope none at all .Severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks .My son .my only son .Draco should be proud said Bellatrix indifferently .The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor .And I will say this for Draco He isnt shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect Narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape .Thats because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store !Why Severus ?Why my son ?It is too dangerous !This is vengeance for Luciuss mistake I know it !Snape said nothing .He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her .Thats why hes chosen Draco isnt it ?she persisted .To punish Lucius ?If Draco succeeds said Snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others .But he wont succeed !sobbed Narcissa .How can he when the Dark Lord himself ?Bellatrix gasped Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve .I only meant .that nobody has yet succeeded .Severus .please .You are you have always been Dracos favorite teacher .You are Luciuss old friend .I beg you .You are the Dark Lords favorite his most trusted advisor .Will you speak to him persuade him ?The Dark Lord will not be persuaded and I am not stupid enough to attempt it said Snape flatly .I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius .Lucius was supposed to be in charge .He got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain .Yes the Dark Lord is angry Narcissa very angry indeed .Then I am right he has chosen Draco in revenge !choked Narcissa .He does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying !When Snape said nothing Narcissa seemed to lose what little selfrestraint she still possessed .Standing up she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes .Her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped You could do it .You could do it instead of Draco Severus .You would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands .Looking down into her tears tained face he said slowly He intends me to do it in the end I think .But he is determined that Draco should try first .You see in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy .In other words it doesnt matter to him if Draco is killed !The Dark Lord is very angry repeated Snape quietly .He failed to hear the prophecy .You know as well as I do Narcissa that he does not forgive easily .She crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor .My only son .my only son .You should be proud !said Bellatrix ruthlessly .If I had sons I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord !Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair .Snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa .He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand .Narcissa thats enough .Drink this .Listen to me .She quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip .It might be possible .for me to help Draco .She sat up her face paperwhite her eyes huge .Severus oh Severus you would help him ?Would you look after him see he comes to no harm ?I can try .She flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape s feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it .If you are there to protect him .Severus will you swear it ?Will you make the Unbreakable Vow ?The Unbreakable Vow ?Snapes expression was blank unreadable .Bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter .Arent you listening Narcissa ?Oh hell try Im sure . .The usual empty words the usual slithering out of action .oh on the Dark Lords orders of course !Snape did not look at Bellatrix .His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissas tearfilled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand .Certainly Narcissa I shall make the Unbreakable Vow he said quietly .Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder .Bellatrixs mouth fell open .Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa .Beneath Bellatrixs astonished gaze they grasped right hands .You will need your wand Bellatrix said Snape coldly .She drew it still looking astonished .And you will need to move a little closer he said .She stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands .Narcissa spoke .Will you Severus watch over my son Draco as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lords wishes ?I will said Snape .A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a redhot wire .And will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm ?I will said Snape .A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain .And should it prove necessary .if it seems Draco will fail .whispered Narcissa Snapes hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform ?There was a moments silence .Bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide .I will said Snape .Bellatrixs astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a rope like a fiery snake .3 WILL AND WONT Harry Potter was snoring loudly .He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane his glasses askew and his mouth wide open .The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair .The room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish .Owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay higgledypiggledy among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk .The headline of one blared HARRY POTTER THE CHOSEN ONE ?Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic during which HeWhoMustNotBeNamed was sighted once more .Were not allowed to talk about it dont ask me anything said one agitated Obliviator who refused to give his name as he left the Ministry last night .Nevertheless highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy .Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy .The nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question .Some are going so far as to call Potter the Chosen One believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He WhoMustNotBeNamed .The current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although ctd .This one bore the headline SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE Most of this front page was taken up with a large blackandwhite picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face .The picture was moving the man was waving at the ceiling .Rufus Scrimgeour previously Head of the Auror office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic .The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community though rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour taking office .Scrimgeours representatives admitted that he had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion .Albus Dumbledore is known to ctd .Newly appointed Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this autumn .For obvious reasons the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans said the Minister although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms a complex array of countercurses and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School .Most seem reassured by the new Ministers tough stand on student safety .Said Mrs Augusta Longbottom My grandson Neville a good friend of Harry Potters incidentally who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it .Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl .Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master .Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her .A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room .Its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty ink bottles and broken quills that coated the very bottom .Nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words ISSUED ON BEHALF OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters .Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you your family and your home from attack .1 .You are advised not to leave the house alone .2 .Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness .Wherever possible arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen .3 .Review the security arrangements around your house making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms and in the case of underage family members SideAlongApparition .4 .Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion see Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building DO NOT ENTER but contact the Auror office immediately .7 .Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi see Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up .An alarm clock repaired by Harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven .Beside it held in place by Harrys relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing .Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat .Dear Harry If it is convenient to you I shall call at number four Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p .m .to escort you to the Burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays .If you are agreeable I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow .I shall explain this more fully when I see you .Kindly send your answer by return of this owl .Hoping to see you this Friday I am yours most sincerely Albus Dumbledore Though he already knew it by heart Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven oclock that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive .He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore s words Harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait Either Dumbledore was going to come or he was not .But Harry had not packed .It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company .He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong his reply to Dumbledore s letter might have gone astray Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap .Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again .The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl Hedwig safely in her cage .The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the streetlamp outside the window went out .Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm .Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement .A tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path .Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk .Even as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of crisps across the room the doorbell rang .Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted Who the blazes is calling at this time of night ?Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other .He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming .Feeling both panicky and close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say Good evening .You must be Mr Dursley .I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him ?Harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of arms reach of his uncle whenever possible .There in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waistlength silver hair and beard .Halfmoon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat .Vernon Dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore s though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes .Judging by your look of stunned disbelief Harry did not warn you that I was coming said Dumbledore pleasantly .However let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house .It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times .He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him .It is a long time since my last visit said Dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon .I must say your agapanthus are flourishing .Vernon Dursley said nothing at all .Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soon the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath .It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully .Ah good evening Harry said Dumbledore looking up at him through his halfmoon glasses with a most satisfied expression .Excellent excellent .These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon .It was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at Harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye .I dont mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable .yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely .Best to say nothing at all my dear man .Ah and this must be Petunia .The kitchen door had opened and there stood Harrys aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual pre bedtime wipedown of all the kitchen surfaces .Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock .Albus Dumbledore said Dumbledore when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction .We have corresponded of course .Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term .And this must be your son Dudley ?Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door .His large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear .Dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled .Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room ?Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him .Harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest .He looked quite extraordinarily out of place .Arent arent we leaving sir ?Harry asked anxiously .Yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said Dumbledore .And I would prefer not to do so in the open .We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncles hospitality only a little longer .You will will you ?Vernon Dursley had entered the room Petunia at his shoulder and Dudley skulking behind them both .Yes said Dumbledore simply I shall .He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap .Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position .We may as well be comfortable said Dumbledore pleasantly .As he replaced his wand in his pocket Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away .Sir what happened to your ?Later Harry said Dumbledore .Please sit down .Harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the Dursleys who seemed stunned into silence .I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness .A third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair .The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honeycolored liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room .Madam Rosmertas finest oakmatured mead said Dumbledore raising his glass to Harry who caught hold of his own and sipped .He had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely .The Dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads .Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself .Well Harry said Dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us .By us I mean the Order of the Phoenix .But first of all I must tell you that Siriuss will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned .Over on the sofa Uncle Vernons head turned but Harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except Oh .Right .This is in the main fairly straightforward Dumbledore went on .You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts and you inherit all of Siriuss personal possessions .The slightly problematic part of the legacy His godfathers dead ?said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa .Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him .The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernons head he attempted to beat it away .Hes dead ?His godfather ?Yes said Dumbledore .He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys .Our problem he continued to Harry as if there had been no interruption is that Sirius also left you number twelve Grimmauld Place .Hes been left a house ?said Uncle Vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him .You can keep using it as headquarters said Harry .I dont care .You can have it I dont really want it .Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve Grimmauld Place again if he could help it .He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius pits dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave .That is generous said Dumbledore .We have however vacated the building temporarily .Why ?Well said Dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of ‘Black .Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother Regulus predeceased him and both were childless .While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood .A vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of Siriuss mother that hung in the hall of number twelve Grimmauld Place flashed into Harrys mind .I bet there has he said .Quite said Dumbledore .And if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Siriuss living relatives which would mean his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange .Without realizing what he was doing Harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor .Bellatrix Lestrange Siriuss killer inherit his house ?No he said .Well obviously we would prefer that she didnt get it either said Dumbledore calmly .The situation is fraught with complications .We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it Unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from Siriuss hands .It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment .Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position .But how are you going to find out if Im allowed to own it ?Fortunately said Dumbledore there is a simple test .He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else Uncle Vernon shouted Will you get these ruddy things off us ?Harry looked around all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere .Oh Im so sorry said Dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again .All three glasses vanished .But it would have been better manners to drink it you know .It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore s wand .You see Dumbledore said turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited He flicked his wand for a fifth time .There was a loud crack and a houseelf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bats ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the Dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags .Aunt Petunia let out a hairraising shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory .Dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and Uncle Vernon bellowed What the hell is that ?Kreacher finished Dumbledore .Kreacher wont Kreacher wont Kreacher wont !croaked the houseelf quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears .Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix oh yes Kreacher belongs to the Blacks Kreacher wants his new mistress Kreacher wont go to the Potter brat Kreacher wont wont wont As you can see Harry said Dumbledore loudly over Kreachers continued croaks of wont wont wont Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership .I dont care said Harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping houseelf .I dont want him .Wont wont wont wont You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange ?Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year ?Wont wont wont wont Harry stared at Dumbledore .He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius was repugnant .Give him an order said Dumbledore .If he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey .If not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress .Wont wont wont WONT .Kreachers voice had risen to a scream .Harry could think of nothing to say except Kreacher shut up !It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke .He grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging .After a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet Aunt Petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum .Well that simplifies matters said Dumbledore cheerfully .It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing .You are the rightful owner of number twelve Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher .Do I do I have to keep him with me ?Harry asked aghast as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet .Not if you dont want to said Dumbledore .If I might make a suggestion you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there .In that way the other houseelves could keep an eye on him .Yeah said Harry in relief yeah Ill do that .Er Kreacher I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other houseelves .Kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave Harry one upsidedown look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished .Good said Dumbledore .There is also the matter of the hippogriff Buckbeak .Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died but Buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements No said Harry at once he can stay with Hagrid .I think Buckbeak would prefer that .Hagrid will be delighted said Dumbledore smiling .He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again .Incidentally we have decided in the interests of Buckbeaks safety to rechristen him ‘Witherwings for the time being though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death .Now Harry is your trunk packed ?Erm .Doubtful that I would turn up ?Dumbledore suggested shrewdly .Ill just go and er finish off said Harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers .It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron .Then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwigs cage in the other he made his way back downstairs .He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room .Nobody was talking .Dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said Professor Im ready now .Good said Dumbledore .Just one last thing then .And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more .As you will no doubt be aware Harry comes of age in a years time No said Aunt Petunia speaking for the first time since Dumbledores arrival .Im sorry ?said Dumbledore politely .No he doesnt .Hes a month younger than Dudley and Dudders doesnt turn eighteen until the year after next .Ah said Dumbledore pleasantly but in the Wizarding world we come of age at seventeen .Uncle Vernon muttered Preposterous but Dumbledore ignored him .Now as you already know the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country .The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare .Harry whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own .Dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together .You did not do as I asked .You have never treated Harry as a son .He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands .The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you .Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them .Us mistreat Dudders ?What dyou ?began Uncle Vernon furiously but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb .The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘home .However miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom .This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man .I ask only this that you allow Harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time .None of the Dursleys said anything .Dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated .Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat Aunt Petunia however was oddly flushed .Well Harry .time for us to be off said Dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak .Until we meet again he said to the Dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room .Bye said Harry hastily to the Dursleys and followed Dumbledore who paused beside Harrys trunk upon which Hedwigs cage was perched .We do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again .I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there .However I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak .just in case .Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within .When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk cage and Hedwig vanished .Dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness .And now Harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure .HORACE SLUGHORN Despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together .He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before there was usually a desk between them .The memory of their last facetoface encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened Harrys sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore s most prized possessions .Dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed .Keep your wand at the ready Harry he said brightly .But I thought Im not allowed to use magic outside school sir ?If there is an attack said Dumbledore I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you .However I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight .Why not sir ?You are with me said Dumbledore simply .This will do Harry .He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive .You have not of course passed your Apparition Test he said .No said Harry .I thought you had to be seventeen ?You do said Dumbledore .So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly .My left if you dont mind as you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment .Harry gripped Dumbledores proffered forearm .Very good said Dumbledore .Well here we go .Harry felt Dumbledores arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tightening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes .He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube .It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished .He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches .His comprehension catching up with his senses Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life .Are you all right ?asked Dumbledore looking down at him solicitously .The sensation does take some getting used to .Im fine said Harry rubbing his ears which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly .But I think I might prefer brooms .Dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck and said This way .He set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses .According to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight .So tell me Harry said Dumbledore .Your scar .has it been hurting at all ?Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightningshaped mark .No he said and IVe been wondering about that .I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemorts getting so powerful again .He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression .I on the other hand thought otherwise said Dumbledore .Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying .It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you .Well Im not complaining said Harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemorts mind .They turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter .Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again .Professor ?Harry ?Er where exactly are we ?This Harry is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton .And what are we doing here ?Ah yes of course I havent told you said Dumbledore .Well I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years but we are once again one member of staff short .We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts .How can I help with that sir ?Oh I think well find a use for you said Dumbledore vaguely .Left here Harry .They proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses .All the windows were dark .The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too .Thinking of dementors Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket .Professor why couldnt we just Apparate directly into your old colleagues house ?Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said Dumbledore .Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry .In any case most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators .At Hogwarts for instance you cant Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds said Harry quickly .Hermione Granger told me .And she is quite right .We turn left again .The church clock chimed midnight behind them .Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask .Sir I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked .Correct said Dumbledore now turning up a steep side street .He has been replaced as I am sure you also saw by Rufus Scrimgeour who used to be Head of the Auror office .Is he .Do you think hes good ?asked Harry .An interesting question said Dumbledore .He is able certainly .A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius .Yes but I meant I know what you meant .Rufus is a man of action and having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate Lord Voldemort .Harry waited but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it .And .sir .I saw about Madam Bones .Yes said Dumbledore quietly .A terrible loss .She was a great witch .Just up here I think ouch .He had pointed with his injured hand .Professor what happened to your ?I have no time to explain now said Dumbledore .It is a thrilling tale I wish to do it justice .He smiled at Harry who understood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions .Sir I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters .Yes I received one myself said Dumbledore still smiling .Did you find it useful ?Not really .No I thought not .You have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor .I didnt .Harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not .For future reference Harry it is raspberry .although of course if I were a Death Eater I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself .Er .right said Harry .Well on that leaflet it said something about Inferi .What exactly are they ?The leaflet wasnt very clear .They are corpses said Dumbledore calmly .Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizards bidding .Inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since Voldemort was last powerful . .He killed enough people to make an army of them of course .This is the place Harry just here .They were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden .Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him .Oh dear .Oh dear dear dear .Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink .The front door was hanging off its hinges .Dumbledore glanced up and down the street .It seemed quite deserted .Wand out and follow me Harry he said quietly .He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path Harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready .Lumos .Dumbledore s wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway .To the left another door stood open .Holding his illuminated wand aloft Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him .A scene of total devastation met their eyes .A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword .A piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor .The wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby .Cushions lay deflated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything .Dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper .Harrys small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around .Not pretty is it ?he said heavily .Yes something horrible has happened here .Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet .Harry followed gazing around halfscared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body .Maybe there was a fight and and they dragged him off Professor ?Harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls .I dont think so said Dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side .You mean hes ?Still here somewhere ?Yes .And without warning Dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled Ouch !Good evening Horace said Dumbledore straightening up again .Harrys jaw dropped .Where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye .There was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet .It hurt .The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas .The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore s chin .What gave it away ?he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly .He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair .My dear Horace said Dumbledore looking amused if the Death Eaters really had come to call the Dark Mark would have been set over the house .The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead .The Dark Mark he muttered .Knew there was something .ah well .Wouldnt have had time anyway Id only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room .He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter .Would you like my assistance clearing up ?asked Dumbledore politely .Please said the other .They stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion .The furniture flew back to its original places ornaments reformed in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean .What kind of blood was that incidentally ?asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock .On the walls ?Dragon shouted the wizard called Horace as with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling .There was a final plunk from the piano and silence .Yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally .My last bottle and prices are skyhigh at the moment .Still it might be reusable .He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within .Hmm .Bit dusty .He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed .It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry .Oho he said his large round eyes flying to Harrys forehead and the lightningshaped scar it bore .Ohol This said Dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is Harry Potter .Harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine Horace Slughorn .Slughorn turned on Dumbledore his expression shrewd .So thats how you thought youd persuade me is it ?Well the answers no Albus .He pushed past Harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation .I suppose we can have a drink at least ?asked Dumbledore .For old times sake ?Slughorn hesitated .All right then one drink he said ungraciously .Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp .Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible .Certainly when Slughorn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon Harry .Hmpf he said looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes .Here He gave a drink to Dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at Harry and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence .His legs were so short they did not touch the floor .Well how have you been keeping Horace ?Dumbledore asked .Not so well said Slughorn at once .Weak chest .Wheezy .Rheumatism too .Cant move like I used to .Well thats to be expected .Old age .Fatigue .And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice said Dumbledore .You cant have had more than three minutes warning ?Slughorn said half irritably half proudly Two .Didnt hear my Intruder Charm go off I was taking a bath .Still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that Im an old man Albus .A tired old man whos earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts .He certainly had those thought Harry looking around the room .It was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft chairs and footstools drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions .If Harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady .Youre not yet as old as I am Horace said Dumbledore .Well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said Slughorn bluntly .His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore s injured hand .Reactions not what they were I see .Youre quite right said Dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made the back of Harrys neck prickle unpleasantly .I am undoubtedly slower than I was .But on the other hand .He shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before It was large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle .Slughorns eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead .So all these precautions against intruders Horace .are they for the Death Eaters benefit or mine ?asked Dumbledore .What would the Death Eaters want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me ?demanded Slughorn .I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said Dumbledore .Are you really telling me that they havent come recruiting yet ?Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered I havent given them the chance .Ive been on the move for a year .Never stay in one place more than a week .Move from Muggle house to Muggle house the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands its been very pleasant Ill be sorry to leave .Its quite easy once you know how one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors dont spot you bringing in the piano .Ingenious said Dumbledore .But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life .Now if you were to return to Hogwarts If youre going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath Albus !I might have been in hiding but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left !If thats how you treat teachers these days Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said Dumbledore .I think you Horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy halfbreeds .Thats what she did did she ?said Slughorn .Idiotic woman .Never liked her .Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him .Sorry Harry said hastily .Its just I didnt like her either .Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly .Are you leaving ?asked Slughorn at once looking hopeful .No I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom said Dumbledore .Oh said Slughorn clearly disappointed .Second on the left down the hall .Dumbledore strode from the room .Once the door had closed behind him there was silence .After a few moments Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself .He shot a furtive look at Harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind .Dont think I dont know why hes brought you he said abruptly .Harry merely looked at Slughorn .Slughorn s watery eyes slid over Harrys scar this time taking in the rest of his face .You look very like your father .Yeah Ive been told said Harry .Except for your eyes .Youve got My mothers eyes yeah .Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing .Hmpf .Yes well .You shouldnt have favorites as a teacher of course but she was one of mine .Your mother Slughorn added in answer to Harrys questioning look .Lily Evans .One of the brightest I ever taught .Vivacious you know .Charming girl .I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House .Very cheeky answers I used to get back too .Which was your House ?I was Head of Slytherin said Slughorn .Oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on Harrys face and wagging a stubby finger at him dont go holding that against me !Youll be Gryffindor like her I suppose ?Yes it usually goes in families .Not always though .Ever heard of Sirius Black ?You must have done been in the papers for the last couple of years died a few weeks ago It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harrys intestines and held them tight .Well anyway he was a big pal of your fathers at school .The whole Black family had been in my House but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor !Shame he was a talented boy .I got his brother Regulus when he came along but Id have liked the set .He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction .Apparently lost in memories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside .Your mother was Muggleborn of course .Couldnt believe it when I found out .Thought she must have been pureblood she was so good .One of my best friends is Muggleborn said Harry and shes the best in our year .Funny how that sometimes happens isnt it ?said Slughorn .Not really said Harry coldly .Slughorn looked down at him in surprise .You mustnt think Im prejudiced !he said .No no no !Havent I just said your mother was one of my alltime favorite students ?And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office of course another Muggleborn a very gifted student and still gives me excellent inside information on the goingson at Gringotts !He bounced up and down a little smiling in a self satisfied way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants .All exstudents all signed .Youll notice Barnabas Cuffe editor of the Daily Prophet hes always interested to hear my take on the days news .And Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes a hamper every birthday and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss who gave him his first job !And at the back youll see her if you just crane your neck thats Gwenog Jones who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies .People are always astonished to hear Im on firstname terms with the Harpies and free tickets whenever I want them !This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously .And all these people know where to find you to send you stuff ?asked Harry who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets Quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him .The smile slid from Slughorn s face as quickly as the blood from his walls .Of course not he said looking down at Harry .I have been out of touch with everybody for a year .Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment .Then he shrugged .Still .the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times .All very well for Dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix !And while Im sure theyre very admirable and brave and all the rest of it I dont personally fancy the mortality rate You dont have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts said Harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats .Most of the teachers arent in it and none of them has ever been killed well unless you count Quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort .Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemorts name spoken aloud and was not disappointed Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which Harry ignored .I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore s headmaster hes supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared isnt he ?Harry went on .Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two He seemed to be thinking over Harrys words .Well yes it is true that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has never sought a fight with Dumbledore he muttered grudgingly .And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters HeWho MustNotBeNamed can hardly count me a friend .in which case I might well be safer a little closer to Albus .I cannot pretend that Amelia Boness death did not shake me .If she with all her Ministry contacts and protection .Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house .Oh there you are Albus he said .Youve been a very long time .Upset stomach ?No I was merely reading the Muggle magazines said Dumbledore .I do love knitting patterns .Well Harry we have trespassed upon Horaces hospitality quite long enough I think it is time for us to leave .Not at all reluctant to obey Harry jumped to his feet .Slughorn seemed taken aback .Youre leaving ?Yes indeed .I think I know a lost cause when I see one .Lost . ?Slughorn seemed agitated .He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and Harry zip up his jacket .Well Im sorry you dont want the job Horace said Dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute .Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again .Our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to .Yes .well .very gracious .as I say .Goodbye then .Bye said Harry .They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them .All right all right 111 do it !Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room .You will come out of retirement ?Yes yes said Slughorn impatiently .I must be mad but yes .Wonderful said Dumbledore beaming .Then Horace we shall see you on the first of September .Yes I daresay you will grunted Slughorn .As they set off down the garden path Slughorn s voice floated after them 111 want a pay rise Dumbledore !Dumbledore chuckled .The garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist .Well done Harry said Dumbledore .I didnt do anything said Harry in surprise .Oh yes you did .You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts .Did you like him ?Er .Harry wasnt sure whether he liked Slughorn or not .He supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a Muggleborn should make a good witch .Horace said Dumbledore relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort .He also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful .He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people .He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseat more room to spread out you see .He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields .Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions forging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office .Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer .I tell you all this Dumbledore continued not to turn you against Horace or as we must now call him Professor Slughorn but to put you on your guard .He will undoubtedly try to collect you Harry .You would be the jewel of his collection ‘the Boy Who Lived .or as they call you these days ‘the Chosen One .At these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry .He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him Neither can live while the other survives .Dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier .This will do Harry .If you will grasp my arm .Braced this time Harry was ready for the Apparition but still found it unpleasant .When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the Burrow .In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it .Ron was in there .and so was Mrs Weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew .If you dont mind Harry said Dumbledore as they passed through the gate Id like a few words with you before we part .In private .Perhaps in here ?Dumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks .A little puzzled Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard .Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at Harry .I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it Harry but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry .Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you .Harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him .He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say His godfathers dead ?and even worse to hear Siriuss name thrown out casually by Slughorn .It was cruel said Dumbledore softly that you and Sirius had such a short time together .A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship .Harry nodded his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledores hat .He could tell that Dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors .Its just hard Harry said finally in a low voice to realize he wont write to me again .His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked .He felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather .and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again .Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said Dumbledore gently .Naturally the loss is devastating .But while I was at the Dursleys .interrupted Harry his voice growing stronger I realized I cant shut myself away or or crack up .Sirius wouldnt have wanted that would he ?And anyway lifes too short .Look at Madam Bones look at Emmeline Vance .It could be me next couldnt it ?But if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into Dumbledores blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight Ill make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can and Voldemort too if I can manage it .Spoken both like your mother and fathers son and Siriuss true godson !said Dumbledore with an approving pat on Harrys back .I take my hat off to you or I would if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders .And now Harry on a closely related subject .I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks ?Yes said Harry and his heart beat a little faster .Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy ?Yes said Harry again .And now everyone knows that Im the one No they do not interrupted Dumbledore .There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed .It is true however that many have guessed correctly that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you .Now I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said ?No said Harry .A wise decision on the whole said Dumbledore .Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger .Yes he continued when Harry looked startled I think they ought to know .You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them .I didnt want to worry or frighten them ?said Dumbledore surveying Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles .Or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened ?You need your friends Harry .As you so rightly said Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away .Harry said nothing but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer .He continued On a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year .Private with you ?said Harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence .Yes .I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education .What will you be teaching me sir ?Oh a little of this a little of that said Dumbledore airily .Harry waited hopefully but Dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly .If Im having lessons with you I wont have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape will I ?Professor Snape Harry and no you will not .Good said Harry in relief because they were a He stopped careful not to say what he really thought .I think the word ‘fiasco would be a good one here said Dumbledore nodding .Harry laughed .Well that means I wont see much of Professor Snape from now on he said because he wont let me carry on Potions unless I get ‘Outstanding in my O .W .L .which I know I havent .Dont count your owls before they are delivered said Dumbledore gravely .Which now I think of it ought to be some time later today .Now two more things Harry before we part .Firstly I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward .Even within Hogwarts itself .Just in case you understand me ?Harry nodded .And lastly while you stay here the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide .These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly all their post for instance is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on .They do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety .However it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them .I understand said Harry quickly .Very well then said Dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard .I see a light in the kitchen .Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are .AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed .Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window .Whos there ?said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs Weasleys .Declare yourself !It is I Dumbledore bringing Harry .The door opened at once .There stood Mrs Weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown .Harry dear !Gracious Albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning !We were lucky said Dumbledore ushering Harry over the threshold .Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected .Harrys doing of course .Ah hello Nymphadora !Harry looked around and saw that Mrs Weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour .A young witch with a pale heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands .Hello Professor she said .Wotcher Harry .Hi Tonks .Harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her smile .Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegumpink hair .Id better be off she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders .Thanks for the tea and sympathy Molly .Please dont leave on my account said Dumbledore courteously I cannot stay I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour .No no I need to get going said Tonks not meeting Dumbledores eyes .Night Dear why not come to dinner at the weekend Remus and MadEye are coming ?No really Molly .thanks anyway .Good night everyone .Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air .Harry noticed that Mrs Weasley looked troubled .Well I shall see you at Hogwarts Harry said Dumbledore .Take care of yourself .Molly your servant .He made Mrs Weasley a bow and followed Tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot .Mrs Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance .Youre like Ron she sighed looking him up and down .Both of you look as though youve had Stretching Jinxes put on you .I swear Rons grown four inches since I last bought him school robes .Are you hungry Harry ?Yeah I am said Harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he was .Sit down dear Ill knock something up .As Harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his knees and settled there purring .So Hermiones here ?he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears .Oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said Mrs Weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand .It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once .Everyones in bed of course we didnt expect you for hours .Here you are She tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward Harry and tipped over Mrs Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup .Bread dear ?Thanks Mrs Weasley .She waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove Mrs Weasley sat down opposite him .So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job ?Harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak .He taught Arthur and me said Mrs Weasley .He was at Hogwarts for ages started around the same time as Dumbledore I think .Did you like him ?His mouth now full of bread Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head .I know what you mean said Mrs Weasley nodding wisely .Of course he can be charming when he wants to be but Arthurs never liked him much .The Ministrys littered with Slughorns old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for Arthur didnt seem to think he was enough of a highflier .Well that just shows you even Slughorn makes mistakes .I dont know whether Rons told you in any of his letters its only just happened but Arthurs been promoted !It could not have been clearer that Mrs Weasley had been bursting to say this .Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering .Thats great !he gasped .You are sweet beamed Mrs Weasley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news .Yes Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and Arthurs heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects .Its a big job hes got ten people reporting to him now !What exactly ?Well you see in all the panic about YouKnowWho odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against YouKnowWho and the Death Eaters .You can imagine the kind of thing socalled protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off .Well in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher whove never done an honest days work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up .The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater .So you see its a very important job and I tell him its just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish .Mrs Weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs .Is Mr Weasley still at work ?Harry asked .Yes he is .As a matter of fact hes a tiny bit late .He said hed be back around midnight .She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table .Harry recognized it at once It had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on the Weasleys sitting room wall though its current position suggested that Mrs Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her .Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril .Its been like that for a while now said Mrs Weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since YouKnowWho came back into the open .I suppose everybodys in mortal danger now .I dont think it can be just our family .but I dont know anyone else whos got a clock like this so I cant check .Oh !With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clocks face .Mr Weasleys hand had switched to traveling .Hes coming !And sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door .Mrs Weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly Arthur is that you ?Yes came Mr Weasleys weary voice .But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater dear .Ask the question !Oh honestly .Molly !All right all right .What is your dearest ambition ?To find out how airplanes stay up .Mrs Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently Mr Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut .Molly !Ive got to ask you your question first !Arthur really this is just silly .What do you like me to call you when were alone together ?Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs Weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl .Mollywobbles whispered a mortified Mrs Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door .Correct said Mr Weasley .Now you can let me in .Mrs Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding redhaired wizard wearing horn rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak .I still dont see why we have to go through that every time you come home said Mrs Weasley still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak .I mean a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you !I know dear but its Ministry procedure and I have to set an example .Something smells good onion soup ?Mr Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table .Harry !We didnt expect you until morning !They shook hands and Mr Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too .Thanks Molly .Its been a tough night .Some idiots started selling MetamorphMedals .Just sling them around your neck and youll be able to change your appearance at will .A hundred thousand disguises all for ten Galleons !And what really happens when you put them on ?Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies .As if St .Mungos didnt have enough to do already !It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny said Mrs Weasley hesitantly .Are you sure ?Of course I am !said Mr Weasley .The boys wouldnt do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection !So is that why youre late MetamorphMedals ?No we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there .Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand .Bed said an undeceived Mrs Weasley at once .Ive got Fred and Georges room all ready for you youll have it to yourself .Why where are they ?Oh theyre in Diagon Alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as theyre so busy said Mrs Weasley .I must say I didnt approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business !Come on dear your trunks already up there .Night Mr Weasley said Harry pushing back his chair .Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room .Gnight Harry said Mr Weasley .Harry saw Mrs Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen .All the hands were once again at mortal peril .Fred and Georges bedroom was on the second floor .Mrs Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow .Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder .A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood Harrys school trunk .The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse .Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting .Harry bade Mrs Weasley good night put on pajamas and got into one of the beds .There was something hard inside the pillowcase .He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purpleand orange sweet which he recognized as a Puking Pastille .Smiling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep .Seconds later or so it seemed to Harry he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open .Sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes .Shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other .Wuzzgoinon ?We didnt know you were here already !said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head .Ron dont hit him !said a girls voice reproachfully .Harrys hand found his glasses and he shoved them on though the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway .A long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus grinning down at him .All right ?Never been better said Harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows .You ?Not bad said Ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it .When did you get here ?Mums only just told us !About one oclock this morning .Were the Muggles all right ?Did they treat you okay ?Same as usual said Harry as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they didnt talk to me much but I like it better that way .Howre you Hermione ?Oh Im fine said Hermione who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something .He thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss Siriuss death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said Whats the time ?Have I missed breakfast ?Dont worry about that Mums bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said Ron rolling his eyes .So whats been going on ?Nothing much Ive just been stuck at my aunt and uncles havent I ?Come off it !said Ron .Youve been off with Dumbledore !It wasnt that exciting .He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement .His names Horace Slughorn .Oh said Ron looking disappointed .We thought Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron and Ron changed tack at top speed .we thought itd be something like that .You did ?said Harry amused .Yeah .yeah now Umbridge has left obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher dont we ?So er whats he like ?He looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be Head of Slytherin said Harry .Something wrong Hermione ?She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment .She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile .No of course not !So um did Slughorn seem like hell be a good teacher ?Dunno said Harry .He cant be worse than Umbridge can he ?I know someone whos worse than Umbridge said a voice from the doorway .Rons younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable .Hi Harry .Whats up with you ?Ron asked .Its her said Ginny plonking herself down on Harrys bed .Shes driving me mad .Whats she done now ?asked Hermione sympathetically .Its the way she talks to me youd think I was about three !I know said Hermione dropping her voice .Shes so full of herself .Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily Cant you two lay off her for five seconds ?Oh thats right defend her snapped Ginny .We all know you cant get enough of her .This seemed an odd comment to make about Rons mother .Starting to feel that he was missing something Harry said Who are you ?But his question was answered before he could finish it .The bedroom door flew open again and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor .A young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless .She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow .To complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray .Arry she said in a throaty voice .Eet as been too long !As she swept over the threshold toward him Mrs Weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross .There was no need to bring up the tray I was just about to do it myself !Eet was no trouble said Fleur Delacour setting the tray across Harrys knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn .I ave been longing to see im .You remember my seester Gabrielle ?She never stops talking about Ariy Potter .She will be delighted to see you again .Oh .is she here too ?Harry croaked .No no silly boy said Fleur with a tinkling laugh I mean next summer when we but do you not know ?Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs Weasley who said We hadnt got around to telling him yet .Fleur turned back to Harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs Weasley across the face .Bill and I are going to be married !Oh said Harry blankly .He could not help noticing how Mrs Weasley Hermione and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one anothers gaze .Wow .Er congratulations !She swooped down upon him and kissed him again .Bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and I only work parttime at Gringotts for my Eenglish so he brought me ere for a few days to get to know is family properly .I was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere isnt much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens !Well enjoy your breakfast Arry !With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her .Mrs Weasley made a noise that sounded like tchah !Mum hates her said Ginny quietly .I do not hate her !said Mrs Weasley in a cross whisper .I just think theyve hurried into this engagement thats all !Theyve known each other a year said Ron who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door .Well thats not very long !I know why its happened of course .Its all this uncertainty with YouKnowWho coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so theyre rushing all sorts of decisions theyd normally take time over .It was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center Including you and Dad said Ginny slyly .Yes well your father and I were made for each other what was the point in waiting ?said Mrs Weasley .Whereas Bill and Fleur .well .what have they really got in common ?Hes a hardworking downto earth sort of person whereas shes A cow said Ginny nodding .But Bills not that downtoearth .Hes a CurseBreaker isnt he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour .I expect thats why hes gone for Phlegm .Stop calling her that Ginny said Mrs Weasley sharply as Harry and Hermione laughed .Well Id better get on .Eat your eggs while theyre warm Harry .Looking careworn she left the room .Ron still seemed slightly punchdrunk he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water .Dont you get used to her if shes staying in the same house ?Harry asked .Well you do said Ron but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then .Its pathetic said Hermione furiously striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall .You dont really want her around forever ?Ginny asked Ron incredulously .When he merely shrugged she said Well Mums going to put a stop to it if she can I bet you anything .Hows she going to manage that ?asked Harry .She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner .I think shes hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead .I hope he does Id much rather have her in the family .Yeah thatll work said Ron sarcastically .Listen no bloke in his right minds going to fancy Tonks when Fleurs around .I mean Tonks is okaylooking when she isnt doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but Shes a damn sight nicer than Phlegm said Ginny And shes more intelligent shes an Auror !said Hermione from the corner .Fleurs not stupid she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament said Harry .Not you as well !said Hermione bitterly .I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘Arry do you ?asked Ginny scornfully .No said Harry wishing he hadnt spoken I was just saying Phlegm I mean Fleur Id much rather have Tonks in the family said Ginny .At least shes a laugh .She hasnt been much of a laugh lately said Ron .Every time Ive seen her shes looked more like Moaning Myrtle .Thats not fair snapped Hermione .She still hasnt got over what happened .you know .I mean he was her cousin !Harrys heart sank .They had arrived at Sirius .He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation .Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other !said Ron .Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met Thats not the point said Hermione .She thinks it was her fault he died !How does she work that one out ?asked Harry in spite of himself .Well she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange wasnt she ?I think she feels that if only she had finished her off Bellatrix couldnt have killed Sirius .Thats stupid said Ron .Its survivors guilt said Hermione .I know Lupins tried to talk her round but shes still really down .Shes actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing !With her ?She cant change her appearance like she used to explained Hermione .I think her powers must have been affected by shock or something .I didnt know that could happen said Harry .Nor did I said Hermione but I suppose if youre really depressed .The door opened again and Mrs Weasley popped her head in .Ginny she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch .Im talking to this lot !said Ginny outraged .Now !said Mrs Weasley and withdrew .She only wants me there so she doesnt have to be alone with Phlegm !said Ginny crossly .She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina .You lot had better come down quickly too she said as she left .Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast .Hermione was peering into Fred and Georges boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry .Ron who was now helping himself to Harrys toast was still gazing dreamily at the door .Whats this ?Hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope .Dunno said Ron but if Fred and Georgeve left it here its probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful .Your mum said the shops going well said Harry .Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business .Thats an understatement said Ron .Theyre raking in the Galleons !I cant wait to see the place we havent been to Diagon Alley yet because Mum says Dads got to be there for extra security and hes been really busy at work but it sounds excellent .And what about Percy ?asked Harry the third eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family .Is he talking to your mum and dad again ?Nope said Ron .But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said Hermione .I heard him telling your mum Ron .Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say said Ron .Hes going to be giving me private lessons this year said Harry conversationally .Ron choked on his bit of toast and Hermione gasped .You kept that quiet !said Ron .I only just remembered said Harry honestly .He told me last night in your broom shed .Blimey .private lessons with Dumbledore !said Ron looking impressed .I wonder why hes . ?His voice tailed away .Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks .Harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed .Dumbledore had said to do it .Why not now ?He fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said I dont know exactly why hes going to be giving me lessons but I think it must be because of the prophecy .Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke .Harry had the impression that both had frozen .He continued still speaking to his fork You know the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry .Nobody knows what it said though said Hermione quickly .It got smashed .Although the Prophet says began Ron but Hermione said Shh !The Prophets got it right said Harry looking up at them both with a great effort Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed .That glass ball that smashed wasnt the only record of the prophecy .I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore s office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me .From what it said Harry took a deep breath it looks like Im the one whos got to finish off Voldemort .At least it said neither of us could live while the other survives .The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment .Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke .Hermione !shouted Harry and Ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash .Hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye .I squeezed it and it it punched me !she gasped .And sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope .Dont worry said Ron who was plainly trying not to laugh Mumll fix that shes good at healing minor injuries Oh well never mind that now !said Hermione hastily .Harry oh Harry .She sat down on the edge of his bed again .We wondered after we got back from the Ministry .Obviously we didnt want to say anything to you but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and Voldemort well we thought it might be something like this .Oh Harry .She stared at him then whispered Are you scared ?Not as much as I was said Harry .When I first heard it I was .but now it seems as though I always knew Id have to face him in the end .When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy said Ron eagerly .And we were kind of right werent we ?He wouldnt be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner wouldnt waste his time he must think youve got a chance !Thats true said Hermione .I wonder what hell teach you Harry ?Really advanced defensive magic probably .powerful countercurses .antijinxes .Harry did not really listen .A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving .He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them . .and evasive enchantments generally concluded Hermione .Well at least you know one lesson youll be having this year thats one more than Ron and me .I wonder when our O .W .L .results will come ?Cant be long now its been a month said Ron .Hang on said Harry as another part of last nights conversation came back to him .I think Dumbledore said our O .W .L .results would be arriving today !Today ?shrieked Hermione .Today ?But why didnt you oh my God you should have said She leapt to her feet .Im going to see whether any owls have come .But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while Mrs Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda .It just wont budge Mrs Weasley was saying anxiously standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healers Helpmate open at Bruises Cuts and Abrasions .This has always worked before I just cant understand it .Itll be Fred and Georges idea of a funny joke making sure it cant come off said Ginny But its got to come off !squeaked Hermione .I cant go around looking like this forever !You wont dear well find an antidote dont worry said Mrs Weasley soothingly .Bill told me ow Fred and George are very amusing !said Fleur smiling serenely .Yes I can hardly breathe for laughing snapped Hermione .She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together .Mrs Weasley youre quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning ?Yes dear Id have noticed said Mrs Weasley patiently .But its barely nine theres still plenty of time .I know I messed up Ancient Runes muttered Hermione feverishly I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation .And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all .I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back Hermione will you shut up youre not the only one whos nervous !barked Ron .And when youve got your eleven ‘Outstanding O .W .L .s .Dont dont dont !said Hermione flapping her hands hysterically .I know Ive failed everything !What happens if we fail ?Harry asked the room at large but it was again Hermione who answered .We discuss our options with our Head of House I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term .Harrys stomach squirmed .He wished he had eaten less breakfast .At Beauxbatons said Fleur complacently we ad a different way of doing things .I think eet was better .We sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then Fleurs words were drowned in a scream .Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window .Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time .Theyre definitely owls said Ron hoarsely jumping up to join Hermione at the window .And there are three of them said Harry hastening to her other side .One for each of us said Hermione in a terrified whisper .Oh no .oh no .oh no .She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows .The owls were flying directly at the Burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope .Oh no squealed Hermione .Mrs Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window .One two three the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line .All three of them lifted their right legs .Harry moved forward .The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle .He untied it with fumbling fingers .To his left Ron was trying to detach his own results to his right Hermiones hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble .Nobody in the kitchen spoke .At last Harry managed to detach the envelope .He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside .ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS Pass Grades Fail Grades Outstanding O Poor P Exceeds Expectations E Dreadful D Acceptable A Troll T Harry James Potter has achieved Astronomy A Care of Magical Creatures E Charms E Defense Against the Dark ArtsO Divination P Herbology E History of Magic D Potions E Transfiguration E Harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading .It was all right He had always known that he would fail Divination and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else !He ran his finger down the grades .he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology he had even exceeded expectations at Potions !And best of all he had achieved Outstanding at Defense Against the Dark Arts !He looked around .Hermione had her back to him and her head bent but Ron was looking delighted .Only failed Divination and History of Magic and who cares about them ?he said happily to Harry .Here swap Harry glanced down Rons grades There were no Outstandings there .Knew youd be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts said Ron punching Harry on the shoulder .Weve done all right havent we ?Well done !said Mrs Weasley proudly ruffling Rons hair .Seven O .W .L .s thats more than Fred and George got together !Hermione ?said Ginny tentatively for Hermione still hadnt turned around .How did you do ?I not bad said Hermione in a small voice .Oh come off it said Ron striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand .Yep nine ‘Outstandings and one ‘Exceeds Expectations at Defense Against the Dark Arts .He looked down at her halfamused halfexasperated .Youre actually disappointed arent you ?Hermione shook her head but Harry laughed .Well were N .E .W .T .students now !grinned Ron .Mum are there any more sausages ?Harry looked back down at his results .They were as good as he could have hoped for .He felt just one tiny twinge of regret .This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror .He had not secured the required Potions grade .He had known all along that he wouldnt but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E .It was odd really seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he couldnt really think of anything else he would like to be .Moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago .Neither can live while the other survives .Wouldnt he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort ?6 DRACOS DETOUR Harry remained within the confines of the Burrows garden over the next few weeks .He spent most of his days playing twoaside Quidditch in the Weasleys orchard he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs Weasley put in front of him .It would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet Sometimes Bill and Mr Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper .To Mrs Weasleys displeasure Harrys sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever .There have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as Mrs Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake .And theyve found Igor Karkaroffs body in a shack up north .The Dark Mark had been set over it well frankly Im surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters Siriuss brother Regulus only managed a few days as far as I can remember .Yes well said Mrs Weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff Did you hear about Florean Fortescue Remus ?asked Bill who was being plied with wine by Fleur .The man who ran the icecream place in Diagon Alley ?Harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach .He used to give me free ice creams .Whats happened to him ?Dragged off by the look of his place .Why ?asked Ron while Mrs Weasley pointedly glared at Bill .Who knows ?He mustve upset them somehow .He was a good man Florean .Talking of Diagon Alley said Mr Weasley looks like Ollivanders gone too .The wandmaker ?said Ginny looking startled .Thats the one .Shops empty .No sign of a struggle .No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped .But wands whatll people do for wands ?Theyll make do with other makers said Lupin .But Ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him its not so good for us .The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts .Harrys included a surprise He had been made Quidditch Captain .That gives you equal status with prefects !cried Hermione happily .You can use our special bathroom now and everything !Wow I remember when Charlie wore one of these said Ron examining the badge with glee .Harry this is so cool youre my Captain if you let me back on the team I suppose ha ha .Well I dont suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now youve got these sighed Mrs Weasley looking down Rons booklist .Well go on Saturday as long as your father doesnt have to go into work again .Im not going there without him .Mum dyou honestly think YouKnow Whos going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts ?sniggered Ron .Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday did they ?said Mrs Weasley firing up at once .If you think securitys a laughing matter you can stay behind and Ill get your things myself No I wanna come I want to see Fred and Georges shop !said Ron hastily .Then you just buck up your ideas young man before I decide youre too immature to come with us !said Mrs Weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of just laundered towels .And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well !Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room .Blimey .you cant even make a joke round here anymore .But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days .Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs Weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast .Bill who would be staying at home with Fleur much to Hermione and Ginnys pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to Harry .Wheres mine ?demanded Ron at once his eyes wide .Thats already Harrys idiot said Bill .I got it out of your vault for you Harry because its taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much .Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his .Well trust me this ways easier .Thanks Bill said Harry pocketing his gold .E is always so thoughtful purred Fleur adoringly stroking Bills nose .Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur .Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back .It was an overcast murky day .One of the special Ministry of Magic cars in which Harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks .Its good Dad can get us these again said Ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window .He Harry Hermione and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat .Dont get used to it its only because of Harry said Mr Weasley over his shoulder .He and Mrs Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a twoseater sofa .Hes been given top grade security status .And well be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too .Harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors .He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for Dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the Ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak .Here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron .Im to wait for you any idea how long you 11 be ?A couple of hours I expect said Mr Weasley .Ah good hes here !Harry imitated Mr Weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt .There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic black bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid the Hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of Harrys face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles .Harry !he boomed sweeping Harry into a bone crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car .Buckbeak Witherwings I mean yeh should see him Harry hes so happy ter be back in the open air Glad hes pleased said Harry grinning as he massaged his ribs .We didnt know ‘security meant you !I know jus like old times innit ?See the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o Aurors but Dumbledore said Id do said Hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets .Lets get goin then after yeh Molly Arthur The Leaky Cauldron was for the first time in Harrys memory completely empty .Only Tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd .He looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak Hagrid said importantly Jus passin through today Tom sure yeh understand Hogwarts business yeh know .Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses Harry Hermione Hagrid and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood .Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street .They stepped through the entrance and paused looking around .Diagon Alley had changed .The colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them .Most of these somber purple posters carried blownup versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving blackandwhite photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose .Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary .A few windows were boarded up including those of Florean Fortescues Ice Cream Parlor .On the other hand a number of shabbylooking stalls had sprung up along the street .The nearest one which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front AMULETS Effective Against Werewolves Dementors and Inferi A seedylooking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby .One for your little girl madam ?he called at Mrs Weasley as they passed leering at Ginny .Protect her pretty neck ?If I were on duty .said Mr Weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller .Yes but dont go arresting anyone now dear were in a hurry said Mrs Weasley nervously consulting a list .I think wed better do Madam Malkins first Hermione wants new dress robes and Rons showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too Harry youve grown so much come on everyone Molly it doesnt make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkins said Mr Weasley .Why dont those three go with Hagrid and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyones schoolbooks ?I dont know said Mrs Weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack .Hagrid do you think ?Don fret theyll be fine with me Molly said Hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid .Mrs Weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry Ron Hermione and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkins .Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as Mrs Weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business .Nobody seemed to be shopping alone .Migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us said Hagrid stopping outside Madam Malkins and bending down to peer through the window .Ill stand guard outside all right ?So Harry Ron and Hermione entered the little shop together .It appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue . .not a child in case you havent noticed Mother .I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone .There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin the owner said Now dear your mothers quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore its nothing to do with being a child Watch where youre sticking that pin will you !A teenage boy with a pale pointed face and white blond hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves .He strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed Harry Ron and Hermione reflected over his shoulder .His light gray eyes narrowed .If youre wondering what the smell is Mother a Mudblood just walked in said Draco Malfoy .I dont think theres any need for language like that !said Madam Malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand .And I dont want wands drawn in my shop either !she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy .Hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered No dont honestly its not worth it .Yeah like youd dare do magic out of school sneered Malfoy .Who blacked your eye Granger ?I want to send them flowers .Thats quite enough !said Madam Malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support .Madam please Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack .Put those away she said coldly to Harry and Ron .If you attack my son again I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do .Really ?said Harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her sisters .He was as tall as she was now .Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in are you ?Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart .Really you shouldnt accuse dangerous thing to say wands away please !But Harry did not lower his wand .Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly .I see that being Dumbledores favorite has given you a false sense of security Harry Potter .But Dumbledore wont always be there to protect you .Harry looked mockingly all around the shop .Wow .look at that .hes not here now !So why not have a go ?They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband !Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry but stumbled over his overlong robe .Ron laughed loudly .Dont you dare talk to my mother like that Potter !Malfoy snarled .Its all right Draco said Narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder .I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius .Harry raised his wand higher .Harry no !moaned Hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side .Think .You mustnt .Youll be in such trouble .Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldnt .She bent toward Malfoy who was still glaring at Harry .I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just Ouch !bellowed Malfoy slapping her hand away .Watch where youre putting your pins woman !Mother I dont think I want these anymore He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkins feet .Youre right Draco said Narcissa with a contemptuous glance at Hermione now I know the kind of scum that shops here .Well do better at Twilfitt and Tattings .And with that the pair of them strode out of the shop Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out .Well reallyl said Madam Malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust .She was distracted all through the fitting of Rons and Harrys new robes tried to sell Hermione wizards dress robes instead of witchs and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them .Got evrything ?asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side .Just about said Harry .Did you see the Malfoys ?Yeah said Hagrid unconcerned .Bu they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o Diagon Alley Harry .Don worry abou them .Harry Ron and Hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion Mr and Mrs Weasley and Ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books .Everyone all right ?said Mrs Weasley .Got your robes ?Right then we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and Georges stick close now .Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying Potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium .Then with Mrs Weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleys Wizard Wheezes the joke shop run by Fred and George .We really havent got too long Mrs Weasley said .So well just have a quick look around and then back to the car .We must be close thats number ninety two .ninetyfour .Whoa said Ron stopping in his tracks .Set against the dull postermuffled shop fronts around them Fred and Georges windows hit the eye like a firework display .Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather stunnedlooking people had actually come to a halt transfixed .The lefthand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked Harrys eyes began to water just looking at it .The righthand window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the Ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOUKNOWWHO ?YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT UNOPOO THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THATS GRIPPING THE NATION !Harry started to laugh .He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs Weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster .Her lips moved silently mouthing the name UNoPoo .Theyll be murdered in their beds !she whispered .No they wont !said Ron who like Harry was laughing .This is brilliant !And he and Harry led the way into the shop .It was packed with customers Harry could not get near the shelves .He stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at Hogwarts Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf .There were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in Self Inking SpellChecking and SmartAnswer varieties .A space cleared in the crowd and Harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted tenyearolds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read REUSABLE HANGMAN SPELL IT OR HELL SWING ! ‘Patented Daydream Charms .Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship . ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top quality highly realistic thirtyminute daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling .Not for sale to undersixteens .You know said Hermione looking up at Harry that really is extraordinary magic !For that Hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free .A beaming Fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair .How are you Harry ?They shook hands .And whats happened to your eye Hermione ?Your punching telescope she said ruefully .Oh blimey I forgot about those said Fred .Here He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste .Just dab it on that bruisell be gone within the hour said Fred .We had to find a decent bruise remover .Were testing most of our products on ourselves .Hermione looked nervous .It is safe isnt it ?she asked .Course it is said Fred bracingly .Come on Harry Ill give you a tour .Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks .Muggle magic tricks !said Fred happily pointing them out .For freaks like Dad you know who love Muggle stuff .Its not a big earner but we do fairly steady business theyre great novelties .Oh heres George .Freds twin shook Harrys hand energetically .Giving him the tour ?Come through the back Harry thats where were making the real money pocket anything you and youll pay in more than GalleonsV he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled EDIBLE DARK MARKS THEYLL MAKE ANYONE SICK !George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker less crowded room .The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued .Weve just developed this more serious line said Fred .Funny how it happened .You wouldnt believe how many people even people who work at the Ministry cant do a decent Shield Charm said George .Course they didnt have you teaching them Harry .Thats right .Well we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off .But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff !And were still getting massive orders !So weve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks Shield Gloves . .I mean they wouldnt help much against the Unforgivable Curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes .And then we thought wed get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts because its such a money spinner continued George enthusiastically .This is cool .Look Instant Darkness Powder were importing it from Peru .Handy if you want to make a quick escape .And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves look said Fred pointing at a number of weirdlooking black horntype objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight .You just drop one surreptitiously and itll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one .Handy said Harry impressed .Here said George catching a couple and throwing them to Harry .A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes .Theres a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley she said .Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called Mr Weasley but they took it in their stride .Right you are Verity Im coming said George promptly .Harry you help yourself to anything you want all right ?No charge .I cant do that !said Harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators .You dont pay here said Fred firmly waving away Harrys gold .But You gave us our startup loan we havent forgotten said George sternly .Take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask .George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms .Havent you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet ?asked Fred .Follow me ladies .Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically .Hermione and Ginny both hung back looking wary .There you go said Fred proudly .Best range of love potions youll find anywhere .Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically .Do they work ?she asked .Certainly they work for up to twentyfour hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question and the attractiveness of the girl said George reappearing suddenly at their side .But were not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when shes already got about five boys on the go from what weve Whatever youve heard from Ron is a big fat lie said Ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf .Whats this ?Guaranteed tensecond pimple vanisher said Fred .Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but dont change the subject .Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas ?Yes I am said Ginny .And last time I looked he was definitely one boy not five .What are those ?She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting highpitched squeaks .Pygmy Puffs said George .Miniature puffskeins we cant breed them fast enough .So what about Michael Corner ?I dumped him he was a bad loser said Ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it .Theyre really cute !Theyre fairly cuddly yes conceded Fred .But youre moving through boyfriends a bit fast arent you ?Ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips .There was such a Mrs Weasleyish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didnt recoil .Its none of your business .And Ill thank you she added angrily to Ron who had just appeared at Georges elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two !Thats three Galleons nine Sickles and a Knut said Fred examining the many boxes in Rons arms .Cough up .Im your brother !And thats our stuff youre nicking .Three Galleons nine Sickles .Ill knock off the Knut .But I havent got three Galleons nine Sickles !Youd better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves .Ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs Weasley who had chosen that moment to appear .If I see you do that again Ill jinx your fingers together she said sharply .Mum can I have a Pygmy Puff ?said Ginny at once .A what ?said Mrs Weasley warily .Look theyre so sweet .Mrs Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs and Harry Ron and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window .Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone .As he passed Weasleys Wizard Wheezes he glanced over his shoulder .Seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him .Wonder where his mummy is ?said Harry frowning .Given her the slip by the looks of it said Ron .Why though ?said Hermione .Harry said nothing he was thinking too hard .Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches .Harry knowing and loathing Malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent .He glanced around .Mrs Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs .Mr Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards .Fred and George were both helping customers .On the other side of the glass Hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street .Get under here quick said Harry pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag .Oh I dont know Harry said Hermione looking uncertainly toward Mrs Weasley .Come on said Ron .She hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron .Nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in Fred and Georges products .Harry Ron and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had .He was going in that direction murmured Harry as quietly as possible so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them .Cmon .They scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until Hermione pointed ahead .Thats him isnt it ?she whispered .Turning left ?Big surprise whispered Ron .For Malfoy had glanced around then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight .Quick or well lose him said Harry speeding up .Our feetll be seen !said Hermione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays .It doesnt matter said Harry impatiently .Just hurry !But Knockturn Alley the side street devoted to the Dark Arts looked completely deserted .They peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all .Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts or at least to be seen buying them .Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch .Ouch !Shh !Look !Hes in there !she breathed in Harrys ear .They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited Borgin and Burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects .There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father .Judging by the movements of Malfoys hands he was talking animatedly .The proprietor of the shop Mr Borgin an oilyhaired stooping man stood facing Malfoy .He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear .If only we could hear what theyre saying !said Hermione .We can !said Ron excitedly .Hang on damn He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest .Extendable Ears look !Fantastic !said Hermione as Ron unraveled the long fleshcolored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door .Oh I hope the door isnt Imperturbable No !said Ron gleefully .Listen !They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which Malfoys voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on . .you know how to fix it ?Possibly said Borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself .Ill need to see it though .Why dont you bring it into the shop ?I cant said Malfoy .Its got to stay put .I just need you to tell me how to do it .Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously .Well without seeing it I must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible .I couldnt guarantee anything .No ?said Malfoy and Harry knew just by his tone that Malfoy was sneering .Perhaps this will make you more confident .He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet .Harry Ron and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was Borgin looking very frightened .Tell anyone said Malfoy and there will be retribution .You know Fenrir Greyback ?Hes a family friend .Hell be dropping in from time to time to make sure youre giving the problem your full attention .There will be no need for Ill decide that said Malfoy .Well Id better be off .And dont forget to keep that one safe Ill need it .Perhaps youd like to take it now ?No of course I wouldnt you stupid little man how would I look carrying that down the street ?Just dont sell it .Of course not .sir .Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy .Not a word to anyone Borgin and that includes my mother understand ?Naturally naturally murmured Borgin bowing again .Next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself .He passed so close to Harry Ron and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again .Inside the shop Borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried .What was that about ?whispered Ron reeling in the Extendable Ears .Dunno said Harry thinking hard .He wants something mended .and he wants to reserve something in there .Could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one ?No he was behind that cabinet You two stay here whispered Hermione .What are you ?But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak .She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again .Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry .Hello horrible morning isnt it ?Hermione said brightly to Borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look .Humming cheerily Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display .Is this necklace for sale ?she asked pausing beside a glassfronted case .If youve got one and a half thousand Galleons said Mr Borgin coldly .Oh er no I havent got quite that much said Hermione walking on .And .what about this lovely um skull ?Sixteen Galleons .So its for sale then ?It isnt being .kept for anyone ?Mr Borgin squinted at her .Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to .Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds .The thing is that er boy who was in here just now Draco Malfoy well hes a friend of mine and I want to get him a birthday present but if hes already reserved anything I obviously dont want to get him the same thing so .um .It was a pretty lame story in Harrys opinion and apparently Borgin thought so too .Out he said sharply .Get out !Hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels .As the bell tinkled again Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign .Ah well said Ron throwing the cloak back over Hermione .Worth a try but you were a bit obvious Well next time you can show me how its done Master of Mystery !she snapped .Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys Wizard Wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxiouslooking Mrs Weasley and Hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence .Once in the shop Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to Mrs Weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly .7 THE SLUG CLUB Harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoys behavior in Knockturn Alley .What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoys face as he had left the shop .Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news .To his slight annoyance however neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoys activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days .Yes Ive already agreed it was fishy Harry said Hermione a little impatiently .She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and Georges room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation .But havent we agreed there could be a lot of explanations ?Maybe hes broken his Hand of Glory said Ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his broomsticks bent tail twigs .Remember that shriveledup arm Malfoy had ?But what about when he said ‘Dont forget to keep that one safe ?asked Harry for the umpteenth time .That sounded to me like Borgins got another one of the broken objects and Malfoy wants both .You reckon ?said Ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle .Yeah I do said Harry .When neither Ron nor Hermione answered he said Malfoys fathers in Azkaban .Dont you think Malfoyd like revenge ?Ron looked up blinking .Malfoy revenge ?What can he do about it ?Thats my point I dont know !said Harry frustrated .But hes up to something and I think we should take it seriously .His fathers a Death Eater and Harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione his mouth open .A startling thought had just occurred to him .Harry ?said Hermione in an anxious voice .Whats wrong ?Your scars not hurting again is it ?asked Ron nervously .Hes a Death Eater said Harry slowly .Hes replaced his father as a Death Eater !There was a silence then Ron erupted in laughter .Malfoy ?Hes sixteen Harry !You think YouKnow Who would let Malfoy join ?It seems very unlikely Harry said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice .What makes you think ?In Madam Malkins .She didnt touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve .It was his left arm .Hes been branded with the Dark Mark .Ron and Hermione looked at each other .Well .said Ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced .I think he just wanted to get out of there Harry said Hermione .He showed Borgin something we couldnt see Harry pressed on stubbornly .Something that seriously scared Borgin .It was the Mark I know it he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously Borgin took him !Ron and Hermione exchanged another look .Im not sure Harry .Yeah I still dont reckon YouKnowWho would let Malfoy join .Annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room Mrs Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment .On the landing he bumped into Ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes .I wouldnt go in the kitchen just now she warned him .Theres a lot of Phlegm around .Ill be careful not to slip in it .Harry smiled .Sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill while Mrs Weasley kept watch over a pile of selfpeeling sprouts looking badtempered . .Bill and I ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer .I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold pink would of course be orrible with Ginnys air Ah Harry !said Mrs Weasley loudly cutting across Fleurs monologue .Good I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow .Weve got Ministry cars again and there will be Aurors waiting at the station Is Tonks going to be there ?asked Harry handing over his Quidditch things .No I dont think so shes been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said .She has let erself go zat Tonks Fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon .A big mistake if you ask Yes thank you said Mrs Weasley tartly cutting across Fleur again .Youd better get on Harry I want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we dont have the usual lastminute scramble .And in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual .The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting trunks packed Hermiones cat Crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and Hedwig Rons owl Pigwidgeon and Ginnys new purple Pygmy Puff Arnold in cages .Au revoir Ariy said Fleur throatily kissing him goodbye .Ron hurried forward looking hopeful but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell sprawling in the dust at Fleurs feet .Furious redfaced and dirt spattered he hurried into the car without saying goodbye .There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at Kings Cross Station .Instead two grimfaced bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking .Quick quick through the barrier said Mrs Weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency .Harry had better go first with She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors who nodded briefly seized Harrys upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten .I can walk thanks said Harry irritably jerking his arm out of the Aurors grip .He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and threequarters where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd .Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds .Without waiting to consult his grimfaced Auror Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment .We cant Harry said Hermione looking apologetic .Ron and Ive got to go to the prefects carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit .Oh yeah I forgot said Harry .Youd better get straight on the train all of you youve only got a few minutes to go said Mrs Weasley consulting her watch .Well have a lovely term Ron .Mr Weasley can I have a quick word ?said Harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment .Of course said Mr Weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless .Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone Mr Weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr Weasley exploding with anger .He could see Mrs Weasley and the grimfaced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away .When we were in Diagon Alley Harry began but Mr Weasley forestalled him with a grimace .Am I about to discover where you Ron and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and Georges shop ?How did you ?Harry please .Youre talking to the man who raised Fred and George .Er .yeah all right we werent in the back room .Very well then lets hear the worst .Well we followed Draco Malfoy .We used my Invisibility Cloak .Did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim ?Because I thought Malfoy was up to something said Harry disregarding Mr Weasleys look of mingled exasperation and amusement .Hed given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why .Of course you did said Mr Weasley sounding resigned .Well ?Did you find out why ?He went into Borgin and Burkes said Harry and started bullying the bloke in there Borgin to help him fix something .And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him .He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing .Like they were a pair .And .Harry took a deep breath .Theres something else .We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm .I think hes been branded with the Dark Mark .I think hes replaced his father as a Death Eater .Mr Weasley looked taken aback .After a moment he said Harry I doubt whether YouKnowWho would allow a sixteenyearold Does anyone really know what YouKnowWho would or wouldnt do ?asked Harry angrily .Mr Weasley Im sorry but isnt it worth investigating ?If Malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done its probably something Dark or dangerous isnt it ?I doubt it to be honest Harry said Mr Weasley slowly .You see when Lucius Malfoy was arrested we raided his house .We took away everything that might have been dangerous .I think you missed something said Harry stubbornly .Well maybe said Mr Weasley but Harry could tell that Mr Weasley was humoring him .There was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing .Youd better hurry said Mr Weasley as Mrs Weasley cried Harry quickly !He hurried forward and Mr and Mrs Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train .Now dear youre coming to us for Christmas its all fixed with Dumbledore so well see you quite soon said Mrs Weasley through the window as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move .You make sure you look after yourself and The train was gathering speed .be good and She was jogging to keep up now .stay safe !Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr and Mrs Weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to .He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but Ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends .He made his way toward her dragging his trunk .People stared shamelessly as he approached .They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him .He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the Chosen One rumors in the Daily Prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight .He tapped Ginny on the shoulder .Fancy trying to find a compartment ?I cant Harry I said Id meet Dean said Ginny brightly .See you later .Right said Harry .He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him Ron and Hermione while at school .Then he blinked and looked around He was surrounded by mesmerized girls .Hi Harry !said a familiar voice from behind him .Neville !said Harry in relief turning to see a round faced boy struggling toward him .Hello Harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind Neville .Luna hi how are you ?Very well thank you said Luna .She was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside .Quibbler still going strong then ?asked Harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year .Oh yes circulations well up said Luna happily .Lets find seats said Harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students .At last they found an empty compartment and Harry hurried inside gratefully .Theyre even staring at us !said Neville indicating himself and Luna .Because were with you !Theyre staring at you because you were at the Ministry too said Harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack .Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet you mustve seen it .Yes I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity said Neville but she was really pleased .Says Im starting to live up to my dad at long last .She bought me a new wand look !He pulled it out and showed it to Harry .Cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly .We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold he vanished next day oi come back here Trevor !And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom .Are we still doing D .A .meetings this year Harry ?asked Luna who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler .No point now weve got rid of Umbridge is there ?said Harry sitting down .Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it .He looked most disappointed .I liked the D .A .I learned loads with you !I enjoyed the meetings too said Luna serenely .It was like having friends .This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment .Before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of fourthyear girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass .You ask him !No you !Ill do it !And one of them a boldlooking girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door .Hi Harry Im Romilda Romilda Vane she said loudly and confidently .Why dont you join us in our compartment ?You dont have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating Nevilles bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor and Luna who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl .Theyre friends of mine said Harry coldly .Oh said the girl looking very surprised .Oh .Okay .And she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her .People expect you to have cooler friends than us said Luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty .You are cool said Harry shortly .None of them was at the Ministry .They didnt fight with me .Thats a very nice thing to say beamed Luna .Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler .We didnt face him though said Neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resignedlooking Trevor in his hand .You did .You should hear my gran talk about you . ‘That Harry Potters got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together .Shed give anything to have you as a grandson .Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to O .W .L .results as soon as he could .While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration N .E .W .T .with only an Acceptable Harry watched him without really listening .Nevilles childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harrys had but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harrys destiny .The prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant .Had Voldemort chosen Neville it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightningshaped scar and the weight of the prophecy .Or would it ?Would Nevilles mother have died to save him as Lily had died for Harry ?Surely she would .But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort ?Would there then have been no Chosen One at all ?An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good bye by his own mother not Rons ?You all right Harry ?You look funny said Neville .Harry started .Sorry I Wrackspurt got you ?asked Luna sympathetically peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles .I what ?A Wrackspurt .Theyre invisible .They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said .I thought I felt one zooming around in here .She flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths .Harry and Neville caught each others eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch .The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight .It was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last .Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up Im starving said Ron longingly slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach .Hi Neville .Hi Luna .Guess what ?he added turning to Harry .Malfoys not doing prefect duty .Hes just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins we saw him when we passed .Harry sat up straight interested .It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year .What did he do when he saw you ?The usual said Ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture .Not like him though is it ?Well that is he did the hand gesture again but why isnt he out there bullying first years ?Dunno said Harry but his mind was racing .Didnt this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students ?Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad said Hermione .Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that .I dont think so said Harry .I think hes But before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third year girl stepped inside .Im supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry PPotter she faltered as her eyes met Harrys and she turned scarlet .She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon .Perplexed Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment .What is it ?Ron demanded as Harry unrolled his .An invitation said Harry .Harry I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C .Sincerely Professor H .E .F .Slug horn Whos Professor Slughorn ?asked Neville looking perplexedly at his own invitation .New teacher said Harry .Well I suppose well have to go wont we ?But what does he want me for ?asked Neville nervously as though he was expecting detention .No idea said Harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct .Listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave lets go under the Invisibility Cloak then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way see what hes up to .This idea however came to nothing The corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak .Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train .Every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him .The exception was Cho Chang who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming .As Harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face .Smirking slightly Harry pushed on .When they reached compartment C they saw at once that they were not Slughorns only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorns welcome Harry was the most warmly anticipated .Harry mboy !said Slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvetcovered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment .His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat .Good to see you good to see you !And you must be Mr Longbottom !Neville nodded looking scared .At a gesture from Slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door .Harry glanced around at their fellow guests .He recognized a Slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two seventhyear boys Harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there Ginny .Now do you know everyone ?Slughorn asked Harry and Neville .Blaise Zabini is in your year of course Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did Harry or Neville Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle .This is Cormac McLaggen perhaps youve come across each other ?No ?McLaggen a large wiryhaired youth raised a hand and Harry and Neville nodded back at him .and this is Marcus Belby I dont know whether ?Belby who was thin and nervouslooking gave a strained smile .and this charming young lady tells me she knows you !Slughorn finished .Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorns back .Well now this is most pleasant said Slughorn cozily .A chance to get to know you all a little better .Here take a napkin .Ive packed my own lunch the trolley as I remember it is heavy on licorice wands and a poor old mans digestive system isnt quite up to such things .Pheasant Belby ?Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant .I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles Slughorn told Harry and Neville now passing around a basket of rolls .Outstanding wizard outstanding and his Order of Merlin most welldeserved .Do you see much of your uncle Marcus ?Unfortunately Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke .Anapneo said Slughorn calmly pointing his wand at Belby whose airway seemed to clear at once .Not .not much of him no gasped Belby his eyes streaming .Well of course I daresay hes busy said Slughorn looking questioningly at Belby .I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work !I suppose .said Belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him .Er .he and my dad dont get on very well you see so I dont really know much about .His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead .Now you Cormac said Slughorn I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in I think Norfolk ?Oh yeah that was fun that was said McLaggen .We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour this was before he became Minister obviously Ah you know Bertie and Rufus too ?beamed Slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow Belby was missed out .Now tell me .It was as Harry had suspected .Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influential everyone except Ginny .Zabini who was interrogated after McLaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what Harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold .It was Nevilles turn next This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for Nevilles parents well known Aurors had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies .At the end of Nevilles interview Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair .And now said Slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act .Harry Potter !Where to begin ?I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer !He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said The Chosen One theyre calling you now !Harry said nothing .Belby McLaggen and Zabini were all staring at him .Of course said Slughorn watching Harry closely there have been rumors for years .I remember when well after that terrible night Lily James and you survived and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism .An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn .Yeah Zabini because youre so talented .at posing .Oh dear !chuckled Slughorn comfortably looking around at Ginny who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn s great belly .You want to be careful Blaise !I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous BatBogey Hex as I was passing her carriage !I wouldnt cross her !Zabini merely looked contemptuous .Anyway said Slughorn turning back to Harry .Such rumors this summer .Of course one doesnt know what to believe the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all !Harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing .Slughorn beamed at him .So modest so modest no wonder Dumbledore is so fond you were there then ?But the rest of the stories so sensational of course one doesnt know quite what to believe this fabled prophecy for instance We never heard a prophecy said Neville turning geranium pink as he said it .Thats right said Ginny staunchly .Neville and I were both there too and all this ‘Chosen One rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual .You were both there too were you ?said Slughorn with great interest looking from Ginny to Neville but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile .Yes .well .it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates of course .Slughorn said sounding a little disappointed .I remember dear Gwenog telling me Gwenog Jones I mean of course Captain of the Holyhead Harpies He meandered off into a longwinded reminiscence but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny .The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the Slug Club at Hogwarts .Harry could not wait to leave but couldnt see how to do so politely .Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and Slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight .Good gracious its getting dark already !I didnt notice that theyd lit the lamps !Youd better go and change into your robes all of you .McLaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails .Harry Blaise any time youre passing .Same goes for you miss he twinkled at Ginny .Well off you go off you go !As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest .He Ginny and Neville followed Zabini back along the train .Im glad thats over muttered Neville .Strange man isnt he ?Yeah he is a bit said Harry his eyes on Zabini .How come you ended up in there Ginny ?He saw me hex Zacharias Smith said Ginny .You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D .A .He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch !Mad eh ?Better reason for inviting someone than because their mothers famous said Harry scowling at the back of Zabini s head or because their uncle But he broke off .An idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea .In a minutes time Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixthyear compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins .If Harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear ?True there was little of the journey left Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harrys suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them .Ill see you two later said Harry under his breath pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself .But whatre you ?asked Neville .Later !whispered Harry darting after Zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless .The corridors were almost completely empty now .Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions .Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door .Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing .Whats wrong with this thing ?said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harrys foot .Harry seized the door and pushed it open hard Zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyles lap and in the ensuing ruckus Harry darted into the compartment leapt onto Zabinis temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack .It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoys eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight .But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic and Malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap .Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoys forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place .The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene Harry could read every word of Crabbes comic directly below him .So Zabini said Malfoy what did Slughorn want ?Just trying to make up to wellconnected people said Zabini who was still glowering at Goyle .Not that he managed to find many .This information did not seem to please Malfoy .Who else had he invited ?he demanded .McLaggen from Gryffindor said Zabini .Oh yeah his uncles big in the Ministry said Malfoy .someone else called Belby from Ravenclaw Not him hes a prat !said Pansy .and Longbottom Potter and that Weasley girl finished Zabini .Malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking Pansys hand aside .He invited Longbottom ?Well I assume so as Longbottom was there said Zabini indifferently .Whats Longbottom got to interest Slughorn ?Zabini shrugged .Potter precious Potter obviously he wanted a look at ‘the Chosen One sneered Malfoy but that Weasley girl !Whats so special about her ?A lot of boys like her said Pansy watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction .Even you think shes goodlooking dont you Blaise and we all know how hard you are to please !I wouldnt touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said Zabini coldly and Pansy looked pleased .Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair .Well I pity Slughorns taste .Maybe hes going a bit senile .Shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day .My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his .Slughorn probably hasnt heard Im on the train or I wouldnt bank on an invitation said Zabini .He asked me about Notts father when I first arrived .They used to be old friends apparently but when he heard hed been caught at the Ministry he didnt look happy and Nott didnt get an invitation did he ?I dont think Slughorns interested in Death Eaters .Malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh .Well who cares what hes interested in ?What is he when you come down to it ?Just some stupid teacher .Malfoy yawned ostentatiously .I mean I might not even be at Hogwarts next year whats it matter to me if some fat old hasbeen likes me or not ?What do you mean you might not be at Hogwarts next year ?said Pansy indignantly ceasing grooming Malfoy at once .Well you never know said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk .I might have er moved on to bigger and better things .Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak Harrys heart began to race .What would Ron and Hermione say about this ?Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things .Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features .Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoys hair looking dumbfounded .Do you mean Him ?Malfoy shrugged .Mother wants me to complete my education but personally I dont see it as that important these days .I mean think about it .When the Dark Lord takes over is he going to care how many O .W .L .s or N .E .W .T .s anyones got ?Of course he isnt .Itll be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown .And you think youll be able to do something for him ?asked Zabini scathingly .Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet ?Ive just said havent I ?Maybe he doesnt care if Im qualified .Maybe the job he wants me to do isnt something that you need to be qualified for said Malfoy quietly .Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles .Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe inspiring .I can see Hogwarts said Malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window .Wed better get our robes on .Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit Harry hard on the side of the head .He let out an involuntary gasp of pain and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning .Harry was not afraid of Malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins .Eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held .To his relief Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck .Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied .At last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt .Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years punching them aside Crabbe and Zabini followed .You go on Malfoy told Pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it .I just want to check something .Pansy left .Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment .People were filing past descending onto the dark platform .Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in .He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again .Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster .What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy ?Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend ?Petrificus Totalusl Without warning Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry who was instantly paralyzed .As though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing floorshaking crash at Malfoys feet the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position .He couldnt move a muscle he could only gaze up at Malfoy who smiled broadly .I thought so he said jubilantly .I heard Goyles trunk hit you .And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back .His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harrys trainers .You didnt hear anything I care about Potter .But while Ive got you here .And he stamped hard on Harrys face .Harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere .Thats from my father .Now lets see .Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harrys immobilized body and threw it over him .I dont reckon theyll find you till the trains back in London he said quietly .See you around Potter .or not .And taking care to tread on Harrys fingers Malfoy left the compartment .SNAPE VICTORIOUS Harry could not move a muscle .He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond .His immediate thought was that someone surely would check the compartments before the train departed again .But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard .His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him .Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth .What a stupid situation to have landed himself in .and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of talk .Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them .Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to London .He tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible .Then he remembered that some wizards like Dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words Accio Wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened .He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the faroff hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone .A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestraldrawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe Goyle Zabini and Pansy Parkinson .The train lurched causing Harry to roll over onto his side .Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling .The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life .The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it .Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said Wotcher Harry .There was a flash of red light and Harrys body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at Tonks who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away .Wed better get out of here quickly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station .Come on well jump .Harry hurried after her into the corridor .She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum .He followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view .The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose .Tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position .Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak .Who did it ?Draco Malfoy said Harry bitterly .Thanks for .well .No problem said Tonks without smiling .From what Harry could see in the darkness she was as mousyhaired and miserablelooking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow .I can fix your nose if you stand still .Harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed stockstill and closed his eyes .Episkey said Tonks .Harrys nose felt very hot and then very cold .He raised a hand and felt it gingerly .It seemed to be mended .Thanks a lot !Youd better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said Tonks still unsmiling .As Harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery fourlegged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness .Was that a Patronus ?asked Harry who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this .Yes Im sending word to the castle that Ive got you or theyll worry .Come on wed better not dawdle .They set off toward the lane that led to the school .How did you find me ?I noticed you hadnt left the train and I knew you had that cloak .I thought you might be hiding for some reason .When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought Id check .But what are you doing here anyway ?Harry asked .Im stationed in Hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said Tonks .Is it just you whos stationed up here or ?No Proudfoot Savage and Dawlish are here too .Dawlish that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year ?Thats right .They trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks .Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak .Last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes .Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful .Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry ?He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her that it hadnt been her fault at all but he couldnt bring himself to do it .He was far from blaming her for Siriuss death it was no more her fault than anyone elses and much less than his but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it .And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence Tonks s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them .Having always traveled there by carriage Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station .With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar .He was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy Tonks behind .But when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut .Alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened .That wont work on these said Tonks .Dumbledore bewitched them himself .Harry looked around .I could climb a wall he suggested .No you couldnt said Tonks flatly .Antiintruder jinxes on all of them .Securitys been tightened a hundredfold this summer .Well then said Harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness I suppose Ill just have to sleep out here and wait for morning .Someones coming down for you said Tonks .Look .A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle .Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filchs wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews .It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of Severus Snape .Well well well sneered Snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open .Nice of you to turn up Potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance .I couldnt change I didnt have my Harry began but Snape cut across him .There is no need to wait Nymphadora Potter is quite ah safe in my hands .I meant Hagrid to get the message said Tonks frowning .Hagrid was late for the startofterm feast just like Potter here so I took it instead .And incidentally said Snape standing back to allow Harry to pass him I was interested to see your new Patronus .He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place .I think you were better off with the old one said Snape the malice in his voice unmistakable .The new one looks weak .As Snape swung the lantern about Harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on Tonkss face .Then she was covered in darkness once more .Good night Harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with Snape .Thanks for .everything .See you Harry .Snape did not speak for a minute or so .Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him .He had loathed Snape from their first encounter but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harrys forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius .Whatever Dumbledore said Harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that Snape s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died .Harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame Snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness .Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness I think said Snape .And let me see another twenty for your Muggle attire .You know I dont believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term We havent even started pudding .You might have set a record Potter .The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze whitehot but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late .I suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you ?Snape continued .And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect .Still Harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode .He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening .They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall .Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed .As though he had read Harrys mind however Snape said No cloak .You can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted Im sure .Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from Snape .The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow .It was all a shimmering blur to Harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted Ron and Hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them .Whereve you blimey whatve you done to your face ?said Ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity .Why whats wrong with it ?said Harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection .Youre covered in blood !said Hermione .Come here She raised her wand said Tergeol and siphoned off the dried blood .Thanks said Harry feeling his now clean face .Hows my nose looking ?Normal said Hermione anxiously .Why shouldnt it ?Harry what happened ?Weve been terrified !Ill tell you later said Harry curtly .He was very conscious that Ginny Neville Dean and Seamus were listening in even Nearly Headless Nick the Gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop .But said Hermione .Not now Hermione said Harry in a darkly significant voice .He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor .Of course Malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he could but there was always a chance it wouldnt reach too many Gryffindor ears .He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings .You missed the Sorting anyway said Hermione as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau .Hat say anything interesting ?asked Harry taking a piece of treacle tart .More of the same really .advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies you know .Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all ?Not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast doesnt he ?It cant be long now .Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast Youve seen Snape ?How come ?said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau .Bumped into him said Harry evasively .Hagrid was only a few minutes late said Hermione .Look hes waving at you Harry .Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid who was indeed waving at him .Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall Head of Gryffindor House the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrids elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting .Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher Professor Trelawney sitting on Hagrids other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the startofterm feast before .She looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles .Having always considered her a bit of a fraud Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harrys parents and attack Harry himself .The knowledge had made him even less eager to find himself in her company but thankfully this year he would be dropping Divination .Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table .Draco Malfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause .Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again .What he would not give to fight Malfoy oneonone .So what did Professor Slughorn want ?Hermione asked .To know what really happened at the Ministry said Harry .Him and everyone else here sniffed Hermione .People were interrogating us about it on the train werent they Ron ?Yeah said Ron .All wanting to know if you really are ‘the Chosen One There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted Nearly Headless Nick inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff .I am considered something of a Potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly .I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information however . ‘Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence I told them . ‘I would rather die than betray his trust .Thats not saying much seeing as youre already dead Ron observed .Once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table .The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly .The very best of evenings to you !he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room .What happened to his hand ?gasped Hermione .She was not the only one who had noticed .Dumbledore s right hand was as blackened and dead looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys .Whispers swept the room Dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his purpleandgold sleeve over his injury .Nothing to worry about he said airily .Now .to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back !Another year full of magical education awaits you .His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer Harry whispered to Hermione .I thought hed have cured it by now though .or Madam Pomfrey wouldve done .It looks as if its died said Hermione with a nauseated expression .But there are some injuries you cant cure .old curses .and there are poisons without antidotes . .and Mr Filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys Wizard Wheezes .Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual .We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators who should do likewise .We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year .Professor Slughorn Slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master .Potions ?Potions ?The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had heard right .Potions ?said Ron and Hermione together turning to stare at Harry .But you said Professor Snape meanwhile said Dumbledore raising his voice so that it carried over all the muttering will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher .No !said Harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction .He did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed .How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time ?Hadnt it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it ?But Harry you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts !said Hermione .I thought he was !said Harry racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching .Snape who was sitting on Dumbledores right did not stand up at the mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much .Well theres one good thing he said savagely .Snape ll be gone by the end of the year .What do you mean ?asked Ron .That jobs jinxed .No ones lasted more than a year . .Quirrell actually died doing it .Personally Im going to keep my fingers crossed for another death .Harry !said Hermione shocked and reproachful .He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year said Ron reasonably .That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay longterm .Moody didnt .Dumbledore cleared his throat .Harry Ron and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his hearts desire .Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing .Now as everybody in this Hall knows Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength .The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke .Harry glanced at Malfoy .Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the headmasters words unworthy of his attention .I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe .The castles magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff .I urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find them in particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours .I implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff immediately .I trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety .Dumbledores blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more .But now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and I know that your top priority is to be wellrested for your lessons tomorrow .Let us therefore say good night .Pip pip !With the usual deafening scraping noise the benches were moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories .Harry who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nosestamping lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him .Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefects duty of shepherding the first years but Ron remained with Harry .What really happened to your nose ?he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall and out of earshot of anyone else .Harry told him .It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh .I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly .Yeah well never mind that said Harry bitterly .Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there .Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts .With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness however Ron was unimpressed .Come on Harry he was just showing off for Parkinson .What kind of mission would YouKnow Who have given him ?How dyou know Voldemort doesnt need someone at Hogwarts ?It wouldnt be the first I wish yehd stop sayin tha name Harry said a reproachful voice behind them .Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head .Dumbledore uses that name said Harry stubbornly .Yeah well thas Dumbledore innit ?said Hagrid mysteriously .So how come yeh were late Harry ?I was worried .Got held up on the train said Harry .Why were you late ?I was with Grawp said Hagrid happily .Los track o the time .Hes got a new home up in the mountains now Dumbledore fixed it nice big cave .Hes much happier than he was in the forest .We were havin a good chat .Really ?said Harry taking care not to catch Rons eye the last time he had met Hagrids halfbrother a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was unable to pronounce properly .Oh yeah hes really come on said Hagrid proudly .Yehll be amazed .Im thinkin o trainin him up as me assistant .Ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze .They were now standing beside the oak front doors .Anyway Ill see yeh tomorrow firs lessons straight after lunch .Come early an yeh can say hello ter Buck I mean Witherwings !Raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the front doors into the darkness .Harry and Ron looked at each other .Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself .Youre not taking Care of Magical Creatures are you ?Ron shook his head .And youre not either are you ?Harry shook his head too .And Hermione said Ron shes not is she ?Harry shook his head again .Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject he did not like to think .9 THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE Harry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning .Hoping for some support for his theory Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express .But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson wasnt he ?interjected Ron quickly before Hermione could say anything .Well she said uncertainly I dont know .It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is .but thats a big lie to tell .Exactly said Harry but he could not press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands .Its rude to point Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule firstyear boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole .The boy who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm .Ron sniggered .I love being a sixth year .And were going to be getting free time this year .Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax .Were going to need that time for studying Ron !said Hermione as they set off down the corridor .Yeah but not today said Ron .Todays going to be a real doss I reckon .Hold it !said Hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a limegreen disk clutched tightly in his hand .Fanged Frisbees are banned hand it over she told him sternly .The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends .Ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione s grip .Excellent Ive always wanted one of these .Hermione s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle Lavender Brown had apparently found Rons remark highly amusing .She continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at Ron over her shoulder .Ron looked rather pleased with himself .The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows .While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening .But he cant really think wed continue Care of Magical Creatures !she said looking distressed .I mean when has any of us expressed .you know .any enthusiasm ?Thats it though innit ?said Ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole .We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid .But he thinks we liked the stupid subject Dyou reckon anyones going to go on to N .E .W .T .Neither Harry nor Hermione answered there was no need .They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures .They avoided Hagrids eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later .After they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting Professor McGonagalls descent from the staff table .The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O .W .L .grades to continue with their chosen N .E .W .T .s .Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms Defense Against the Dark Arts Transfiguration Herbology Arithmancy Ancient Runes and Potions and shot off to a firstperiod Ancient Runes class without further ado .Neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O .W .L .results .Herbology fine she said .Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ‘Outstanding O .W .L .And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations .But the problem is Transfiguration .Im sorry Longbottom but an Acceptable really isnt good enough to continue to N .E .W .T level .I just dont think youd be able to cope with the coursework .Neville hung his head .Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles .Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration anyway ?Ive never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it .Neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants .Hmph snorted Professor McGonagall .Its high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson shes got rather than the one she thinks she ought to have particularly after what happened at the Ministry .Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before .Im sorry Longbottom but I cannot let you into my N .E .W .T .class .I see that you have an ‘Exceeds Expectations in Charms however why not try for a N .E .W .T .in Charms ?My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option mumbled Neville .Take Charms said Professor McGonagall and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O .W .L .the subject is not necessarily worthless .Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Nevilles face Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to Neville .Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil whose first question was whether Firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching Divination .He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said Professor McGonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination .The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney .Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen .So Potter Potter .said Professor McGonagall consulting her notes as she turned to Harry .Charms Defense Against the Dark Arts Herbology Transfiguration .all fine .I must say I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark Potter very pleased .Now why havent you applied to continue with Potions ?I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror ?It was but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding in my O .W .L .Professor .And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject .Professor Slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept N .E .W .T students with ‘Exceeds Expectations at O .W .L .Do you wish to proceed with Potions ?Yes said Harry but I didnt buy the books or any ingredients or anything Im sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some said Professor McGonagall .Very well Potter here is your schedule .Oh by the way twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team .I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure .A few minutes later Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry and the two of them left the table together .Look said Ron delightedly gazing at his schedule weve got a free period now .and a free period after break .and after lunch .excellent .They returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including Katie Bell the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year .I thought youd get that well done she called over pointing at the Captains badge on Harrys chest .Tell me when you call trials !Dont be stupid said Harry you dont need to try out Ive watched you play for five years .You mustnt start off like that she said warningly .For all you know theres someone much better than me out there .Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends .Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourthyear student .It zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry .Crookshankss yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close .An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below .Hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking putupon .We got so much homework for Runes she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her .A fifteen inch essay two translations and Ive got to read these by Wednesday !Shame yawned Ron .You wait she said resentfully .I bet Snape gives us loads .The classroom door opened as she spoke and Snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair .Silence fell over the queue immediately .Inside he said .Harry looked around as they entered .Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight .New pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts .Nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures .I have not asked you to take out your books said Snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair .I wish to speak to you and I want your fullest attention .His black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harrys than anyone elses .You have had five teachers in this subject so far I believe .You believe .like you havent watched them all come and go Snape hoping youd be next thought Harry scathingly .Naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities .Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O .W .L .in this subject .I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N .E .W .T .work which will be much more advanced .Snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view .The Dark Arts said Snape are many varied ever changing and eternal .Fighting them is like fighting a manyheaded monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before .You are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible .Harry stared at Snape .It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as Snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice ?Your defenses said Snape a little louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo .These pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the Cruciatus Curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the Dementors Kiss a wizard lying huddled and blankeyed slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the Inferius a bloody mass upon the ground .Has an Inferius been seen then ?said Parvati Patil in a highpitched voice .Is it definite is he using them ?The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past said Snape which means you would be welladvised to assume he might use them again .Now .He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him . .you are I believe complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells .What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell ?Hermiones hand shot into the air .Snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly Very well Miss Granger ?Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic youre about to perform said Hermione which gives you a splitsecond advantage .An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells Grade Six said Snape dismissively over in the corner Malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials .Yes those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spellcasting .Not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more lack .Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year .He refused to drop his gaze but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away .You will now divide Snape went on into pairs .One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking .The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence .Carry on .Although Snape did not know it Harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the D .A .how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year .None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however .A reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud .Typically ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Nevilles muttered JellyLegs Jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought Harry bitterly but which Snape ignored .He swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task .Ron who was supposed to be jinxing Harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation .Harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come .Pathetic Weasley said Snape after a while .Here let me show you He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten he yelled Protegol His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked offbalance and hit a desk .The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself scowling .Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells Potter ?Yes said Harry stiffly .Yes sir .Theres no need to call me ‘sir Professor .The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying .Several people gasped including Hermione .Behind Snape however Ron Dean and Seamus grinned appreciatively .Detention Saturday night my office said Snape .I do not take cheek from anyone Potter .not even ‘the Chosen One .That was brilliant Harry !chortled Ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later .You really shouldnt have said it said Hermione frowning at Ron .What made you ?He tried to jinx me in case you didnt notice !fumed Harry .I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons !Why doesnt he use another guinea pig for a change ?Whats Dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach Defense ?Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts ?He loves them !All that unfixed indestructible stuff Well said Hermione I thought he sounded a bit like you .Like me ?Yes when you were telling us what its like to face Voldemort .You said it wasnt just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your guts well wasnt that what Snape was saying ?That it really comes down to being brave and quickthinking ?Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue .Harry !Hey Harry !Harry looked around Jack Sloper one of the Beaters on last years Gryffindor Quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment .For you panted Sloper .Listen I heard youre the new Captain .Whenre you holding trials ?Im not sure yet said Harry thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team .Ill let you know .Oh right .I was hoping itd be this weekend But Harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment .Leaving Sloper in midsentence he hurried away with Ron and Hermione unrolling the parchment as he went .Dear Harry I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday .Kindly come along to my office at 8 p .m .I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school .Yours sincerely Albus Dumbledore P .S .I enjoy Acid Pops .He enjoys Acid Pops ?said Ron who had read the message over Harrys shoulder and was looking perplexed .Its the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said Harry in a low voice .Ha !Snapes not going to be pleased .I wont be able to do his detention !He Ron and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry .Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know .Hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic .After break she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snapes homework .This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their afterlunch free period though she considerably speeded up the process .They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoons double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been Snapes .When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N .E .W .T .level .Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O .W .L .grade but four Slytherins had made it through including Malfoy .Four Ravenclaws were there and one Hufflepuff Ernie Macmillan whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner .Harry Ernie said portentously holding out his hand as Harry approached didnt get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning .Good lesson I thought but Shield Charms are old hat of course for us old D .A .lags .And how are you Ron Hermione ?Before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and Slughorns belly preceded him out of the door .As they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm .The dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells .Harry Ron and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons .The four Slytherins took a table together as did the four Ravenclaws .This left Harry Ron and Hermione to share a table with Ernie .They chose the one nearest a goldcolored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow .He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potions fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink .A great contentment stole over him he grinned across at Ron who grinned back lazily .Now then now then now then said Slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors .Scales out everyone and potion kits and dont forget your copies of Advanced PotionMaking .Sir ?said Harry raising his hand .Harry mboy ?I havent got a book or scales or anything nors Ron we didnt realize wed be able to do the N .E .W .T .you see Ah yes Professor McGonagall did mention .not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all .You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and Im sure we can lend you some scales and weve got a small stock of old books here theyll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts .Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a moments foraging emerged with two very battered looking copies of Advanced PotionMaking by Libatius Borage which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales .Now then said Slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off Ive prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know .These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N .E .W .T .s .You ought to have heard of em even if you havent made em yet .Anyone tell me what this one is ?He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table .Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it .Hermiones wellpracticed hand hit the air before anybody elses Slughorn pointed at her .Its Veritaserum a colorless odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth said Hermione .Very good very good !said Slughorn happily .Now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known . .Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too .Who can ?Hermiones hand was fastest once more .Its Polyjuice Potion sir she said .Harry too had recognized the slowbubbling mudlike substance in the second cauldron but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year .Excellent excellent !Now this one here .yes my dear ?said Slughorn now looking slightly bemused as Hermiones hand punched the air again .Its Amortentia !It is indeed .It seems almost foolish to ask said Slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but I assume you know what it does ?Its the most powerful love potion in the world !said Hermione .Quite right !You recognized it I suppose by its distinctive motherofpearl sheen ?And the steam rising in characteristic spirals said Hermione enthusiastically and its supposed to smell differently to each of us according to what attracts us and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence .May I ask your name my dear ?said Slughorn ignoring Hermiones embarrassment .Hermione Granger sir .Granger ?Granger ?Can you possibly be related to Hector DagworthGranger who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers ?No I dont think so sir .Im Muggleborn you see .Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but Slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry who was sitting next to her .Oho ! ‘One of my best friends is Muggleborn and shes the best in our yeah Im assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke Harry ?Yes sir said Harry .Well well take twenty wellearned points for Gryffindor Miss Granger said Slughorn genially .Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face .Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered Did you really tell him Im the best in the year ?Oh Harry !Well whats so impressive about that ?whispered Ron who for some reason looked annoyed .You are the best in the year Idve told him so if hed asked me !Hermione smiled but made a shhing gesture so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying .Ron looked slightly disgruntled .Amortentia doesnt really create love of course .It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love .No this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession .It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room oh yes he said nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott both of whom were smirking skeptically .When you have seen as much of life as I have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love .And now said Slughorn it is time for us to start work .Sir you havent told us whats in this one said Ernie Macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn s desk .The potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled .Oho said Slughorn again .Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect .Yes .That .Well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis .I take it he turned smiling to look at Hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what Felix Felicis does Miss Granger ?Its liquid luck said Hermione excitedly .It makes you lucky !The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter .Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention .Quite right take another ten points for Gryffindor .Yes its a funny little potion Felix Felicis said Slughorn .Desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong .However if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed .at least until the effects wear off .Why dont people drink it all the time sir ?said Terry Boot eagerly .Because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said Slughorn .Too much of a good thing you know .highly toxic in large quantities .But taken sparingly and very occasionally .Have you ever taken it sir ?asked Michael Corner with great interest .Twice in my life said Slughorn .Once when I was twentyfour once when I was fiftyseven .Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast .Two perfect days .He gazed dreamily into the distance .Whether he was playacting or not thought Harry the effect was good .And that said Slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson .There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold .One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis said Slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all .Enough for twelve hours luck .From dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt .Now I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions .sporting events for instance examinations or elections .So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only .and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary !So said Slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win my fabulous prize ?Well by turning to page ten of Advanced PotionMaking .We have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death .I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody .The person who does best however will win little Felix here .Off you go !There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke .The concentration within the room was almost tangible .Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking .It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day .Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him .To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions .Bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed .As he dashed back to his cauldron he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could .Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions that it was hard to keep your work private .Within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam .Hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest .Her potion already resembled the smooth black currantcolored liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage .Having finished chopping his roots Harry bent low over his book again .It was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction Crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting .Sir I think you knew my grandfather Abraxas Malfoy ?Harry looked up Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table .Yes said Slughorn without looking at Malfoy I was sorry to hear he had died although of course it wasnt unexpected dragon pox at his age .And he walked away .Harry bent back over his cauldron smirking .He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape .It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis .The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up .Harry turned to Hermione .Can I borrow your silver knife ?She nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now .Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger .To his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all .Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook .His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions .According to the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water .According to the addition the previous owner had made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir .Could the old owner be right twice ?Harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise .The effect was immediate .The potion turned palest pink .How are you doing that ?demanded Hermione who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple .Add a clockwise stir No no the book says counterclockwise !she snapped .Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing .Seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause .seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise .Across the table Ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice .Harry glanced around .As far as he could see no one elses potion had turned as pale as his .He felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon .And times .up !called Slughorn .Stop stirring please !Slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons .He made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff .At last he reached the table where Harry Ron Hermione and Ernie were sitting .He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Rons cauldron .He passed over Ernies navy concoction .Hermiones potion he gave an approving nod .Then he saw Harrys and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face .The clear winner !he cried to the dungeon .Excellent excellent Harry !Good lord its clear youve inherited your mothers talent .She was a dab hand at Potions Lily was !Here you are then here you are one bottle of Felix Felicis as promised and use it well !Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermiones .Ron looked simply dumbfounded .How did you do that ?he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon .Got lucky I suppose said Harry because Malfoy was within earshot .Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them .Hermiones face became stonier with every word he uttered .I spose you think I cheated ?he finished aggravated by her expression .Well it wasnt exactly your own work was it ?she said stiffly .He only followed different instructions to ours said Ron .Couldve been a catastrophe couldnt it ?But he took a risk and it paid off .He heaved a sigh .Slughorn couldve handed me that book but no I get the one no ones ever written on .Puked on by the look of page fiftytwo but Hang on said a voice close by Harrys left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorns dungeon .He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them .Did I hear right ?Youve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book Harry ?She looked alarmed and angry .Harry knew what was on her mind at once .Its nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice .Its not like you know Riddles diary .Its just an old textbook someones scribbled on .But youre doing what it says ?I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly Ginny theres nothing funny Ginnys got a point said Hermione perking up at once .We ought to check that theres nothing odd about it .I mean all these funny instructions who knows ?Hey !said Harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and raised her wand .Specialis Revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover .Nothing whatsoever happened .The book simply lay there looking old and dirty and dogeared .Finished ?said Harry irritably .Or dyou want to wait and see if it does a few backflips ?It seems all right said Hermione still staring at the book suspiciously .I mean it really does seem to be .just a textbook .Good .Then Ill have it back said Harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor .Nobody else was looking .Harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs .This Book is the Property of the HalfBlood Prince .10 THE HOUSE OF GAUNT For the rest of the weeks Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the HalfBlood Princes instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borages with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harrys abilities saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented .Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this .Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious .Hermione meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instructions but becoming increasingly badtempered as they yielded poorer results than the Princes .Harry wondered vaguely who the HalfBlood Prince had been .Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced PotionMaking he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes not all of them concerned with potionmaking .Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself .Or herself said Hermione irritably overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening .It might have been a girl .I think the handwriting looks more like a girls than a boys .The HalfBlood Prince he was called Harry said .How many girls have been Princes ?Hermione seemed to have no answer to this .She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Re materialization away from Ron who was trying to read it upside down .Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking back into his bag .Its five to eight Id better go Ill be late for Dumbledore .Ooooh !gasped Hermione looking up at once .Good luck !Well wait up we want to hear what he teaches you !Hope it goes okay said Ron and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole .Harry proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirtylooking playing cards reading them as she walked .Two of spades conflict she murmured as she passed the place where Harry crouched hidden .Seven of spades an ill omen .Ten of spades violence .Knave of spades a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislikes the questioner She stopped dead right on the other side of Harrys statue .Well that cant be right she said annoyed and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her .Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventhfloor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall .Acid Pops said Harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed onto which Harry stepped so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledores office .Harry knocked .Come in said Dumbledores voice .Good evening sir said Harry walking into the headmasters office .Ah good evening Harry .Sit down said Dumbledore smiling .I hope youve had an enjoyable first week back at school ?Yes thanks sir said Harry .You must have been busy a detention under your belt already !Er began Harry awkwardly but Dumbledore did not look too stern .I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead .Right said Harry who had more pressing matters on his mind than S napes detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening .The circular office looked just as it always did the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables puffing smoke and whirring portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames and Dumbledores magnificent phoenix Fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching Harry with bright interest .It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice .So Harry said Dumbledore in a businesslike voice .You have been wondering I am sure what I have planned for you during these for want of a better word lessons ?Yes sir .Well I have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given certain information .There was a pause .You said at the end of last term you were going to tell me everything said Harry .It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice .Sir he added .And so I did said Dumbledore placidly .I told you everything I know .From this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork .From here on in Harry I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron .But you think youre right ?said Harry .Naturally I do but as I have already proven to you I make mistakes like the next man .In fact being forgive me rather cleverer than most men my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger .Sir said Harry tentatively does what youre going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy ?Will it help me .survive ?It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy said Dumbledore as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next days weather and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive .Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk past Harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door .When Dumbledore straightened up he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim .He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry .You look worried .Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension .His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable .The last time he had disturbed its contents he had seen much more than he would have wished .But Dumbledore was smiling .This time you enter the Pensieve with me .and even more unusually with permission .Where are we going sir ?For a trip down Bob Ogdens memory lane said Dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery white substance .Who was Bob Ogden ?He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement said Dumbledore .He died some time ago but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me .We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties .If you will stand Harry .But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle His injured hand seemed stiff and painful .Shall shall I sir ?No matter Harry Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out .Sir how did you injure your hand ?Harry asked again looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity .Now is not the moment for that story Harry .Not yet .We have an appointment with Bob Ogden .Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas .After you said Dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl .Harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance .He felt his feet leave the office floor he was falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he was blinking in dazzling sunlight .Before his eyes had adjusted Dumbledore landed beside him .They were standing in a country lane bordered by high tangled hedgerows beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forgetmenot .Some ten feet in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks .He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the lefthand side of the road .Harry knew this must be Ogden he was the only person in sight and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles in this case a frock coat and spats over a striped one piece bathing costume .Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane .Dumbledore and Harry followed .As they passed the wooden sign Harry looked up at its two arms .The one pointing back the way they had come read GREAT HANGLETON 5 MILES .The arm pointing after Ogden said LITTLE HANGLETON 1 MILE .They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing frockcoated figure ahead .Then the lane curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them .Harry could see a village undoubtedly Little Hangleton nestled between two steep hills its church and graveyard clearly visible .Across the valley set on the opposite hillside was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn .Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope .Dumbledore lengthened his stride and Harry hurried to keep up .He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance .He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village however .The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it was to see the very edge of Ogdens frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge .Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind .The path was crooked rocky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them .Sure enough the track soon opened up at the copse and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden who had stopped and drawn his wand .Despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before Harrys eyes discerned the building halfhidden amongst the tangle of trunks .It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below .He wondered whether it was inhabited its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places .Nettles grew all around it their tips reaching the windows which were tiny and thick with grime .Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there however one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it as though somebody was cooking .Ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to Harry rather cautiously .As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him he stopped again staring at the front door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake .Then there was a rustle and a crack and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree landing on his feet right in front of Ogden who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled .Youre not welcome .The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color .Several of his teeth were missing .His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions .He might have looked comical but he did not the effect was frightening and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke .Er good morning .Im from the Ministry of Magic Youre not welcome .Er Im sorry I dont understand you said Ogden nervously .Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim the stranger was making himself very clear in Harrys opinion particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other .You understand him Im sure Harry ?said Dumbledore quietly .Yes of course said Harry slightly nonplussed .Why cant Ogden ?But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood .Hes speaking Parseltongue ?Very good said Dumbledore nodding and smiling .The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden knife in one hand wand in the other .Now look Ogden began but too late There was a bang and Ogden was on the ground clutching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers .Morfin !said a loud voice .An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically .This man was shorter than the first and oddly proportioned his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong which with his bright brown eyes short scrubby hair and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monkey .He came to a halt beside the man with the knife who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground .Ministry is it ?said the older man looking down at Ogden .Correct !said Ogden angrily dabbing his face .And you I take it are Mr Gaunt ?Sright said Gaunt .Got you in the face did he ?Yes he did !snapped Ogden .Shouldve made your presence known shouldnt you ?said Gaunt aggressively .This is private property .Cant just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself .Defend himself against what man ?said Ogden clambering back to his feet .Busybodies .Intruders .Muggles and filth .Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once .Mr Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin .Get in the house .Dont argue .This time ready for it Harry recognized Parseltongue even while he could understand what was being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear .Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again .Its your son Im here to see Mr Gaunt said Ogden as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat .That was Morfin wasnt it ?Ar that was Morfin said the old man indifferently .Are you pureblood ?he asked suddenly aggressive .Thats neither here nor there said Ogden coldly and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise .Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently .He squinted into Ogdens face and muttered in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone Now I come to think about it Ive seen noses like yours down in the village .I dont doubt it if your sons been let loose on them said Ogden .Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside ?Inside ?Yes Mr Gaunt .Ive already told you .Im here about Morfin .We sent an owl Ive no use for owls said Gaunt .I dont open letters .Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors said Ogden tartly .I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning All right all right all right !bellowed Gaunt .Come in the bleeding house then and much good itll do you !The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms .Two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined .Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue Hissy hissy little snakey Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or hell nail you to the door .There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her .She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalidlooking pots and pans above it .Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy face .Her eyes like her brothers stared in opposite directions .She looked a little cleaner than the two men but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeatedlooking person .Mdaughter Merope said Gaunt grudgingly as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her .Good morning said Ogden .She did not answer but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her .Well Mr Gaunt said Ogden to get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son Morfin performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night .There was a deafening clang .Merope had dropped one of the pots .Pick it up Gaunt bellowed at her .Thats it grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle whats your wand for you useless sack of muck ?Mr Gaunt please !said Ogden in a shocked voice as Merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two .Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter .Gaunt screamed Mend it you pointless lump mend it !Merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly Reparo .The pot mended itself instantly .Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden but seemed to think better of it Instead he jeered at his daughter Lucky the nice man from the Ministrys here isnt it ?Perhaps hell take you off my hands perhaps he doesnt mind dirty Squibs .Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden Merope picked up the pot and returned it hands trembling to its shelf .She then stood quite still her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish .Mr Gaunt Ogden began again as Ive said the reason for my visit I heard you the first time !snapped Gaunt .And so what ?Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him what about it then ?Morfin has broken Wizarding law said Ogden sternly . ‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law .Gaunt imitated Ogdens voice making it pompous and singsong .Morfin cackled again .He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson thats illegal now is it ?Yes said Ogden .Im afraid it is .He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it .Whats that then his sentence ?said Gaunt his voice rising angrily .It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing Summons !Summons ?Who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere ?Im Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad said Ogden .And you think were scum do you ?screamed Gaunt advancing on Ogden now with a dirty yellow nailed finger pointing at his chest .Scum wholl come running when the Ministry tells em to ?Do you know who youre talking to you filthy little Mudblood do you ?I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr Gaunt said Ogden looking wary but standing his ground .Thats right !roared Gaunt .For a moment Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly black stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger waving it before Ogdens eyes .See this ?See this ?Know what it is ?Know where it came from ?Centuries its been in our family thats how far back we go and pureblood all the way !Know how much Ive been offered for this with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone ?Ive really no idea said Ogden blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose and its quite beside the point Mr Gaunt .Your son has committed With a howl of rage Gaunt ran toward his daughter .For a split second Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat next moment he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck .See this ?he bellowed at Ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath .I see it I see it !said Ogden hastily .Slytherinsl yelled Gaunt .Salazar Slytherins !Were his last living descendants what do you say to that eh ?Mr Gaunt your daughter !said Ogden in alarm but Gaunt had already released Merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air .So !said Gaunt triumphantly as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute .Dont you go talking to us as if were dirt on your shoes !Generations of purebloods wizards all more than you can say I dont doubt !And he spat on the floor at Ogdens feet .Morfin cackled again .Merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing .Mr Gaunt said Ogden doggedly I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand .I am here because of Morfin Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night .Our information he glanced down at his scroll of parchment is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hives .Morfin giggled .Be quiet boy snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue and Morfin fell silent again .And so what if he did then ?Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden .I expect youve wiped the Muggle s filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot Thats hardly the point is it Mr Gaunt ?said Ogden .This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless Ar I had you marked out as a Mugglelover the moment I saw you sneered Gaunt and he spat on the floor again .This discussion is getting us nowhere said Ogden firmly .It is clear from your sons attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions .He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again .Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg Ogden broke off .The jingling clopping sounds of horses and loud laughing voices were drifting in through the open window .Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood .Gaunt froze listening his eyes wide .Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds his expression hungry .Merope raised her head .Her face Harry saw was starkly white .My God what an eyesore !rang out a girls voice as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them .Couldnt your father have that hovel cleared away Tom ?Its not ours said a young mans voice .Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt and his children .The sons quite mad you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village The girl laughed .The jingling clopping noises were growing louder and louder .Morfin made to get out of his armchair .Keep your seat said his father warningly in Parseltongue .Tom said the girls voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house I might be wrong but has somebody nailed a snake to that door ?Good lord youre right !said the mans voice .Thatll be the son I told you hes not right in the head .Dont look at it Cecilia darling .The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again . ‘Darling whispered Morfin in Parseltongue looking at his sister . ‘Darling he called her .So he wouldnt have you anyway .Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint .Whats that ?said Gaunt sharply also in Parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter .What did you say Morfin ?She likes looking at that Muggle said Morfin a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister who now looked terrified .Always in the garden when he passes peering through the hedge at him isnt she ?And last night Merope shook her head jerkily imploringly but Morfin went on ruthlessly Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home wasnt she ?Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle ?said Gaunt quietly .All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping .Is it true ?said Gaunt in a deadly voice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl .My daughter pureblooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin hankering after a filthy dirtveined Muggle ?Merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak .But I got him FatheA cackled Morfin .I got him as he went by and he didnt look so pretty with hives all over him did he Merope ?You disgusting little Squib you filthy little blood traitoA .roared Gaunt losing control and his hands closed around his daughters throat .Both Harry and Ogden yelled No !at the same time Ogden raised his wand and cried Relashiol Gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back .With a roar of rage Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand .Ogden ran for his life .Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed Merope s screams echoing in his ears .Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane his arms over his head where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome darkhaired young man .Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden who bounced off the horses flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running pellmell up the lane .I think that will do Harry said Dumbledore .He took Harry by the elbow and tugged .Next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their feet back in Dumbledore s now twilit office .What happened to the girl in the cottage ?said Harry at once as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand .Merope or whatever her name was ?Oh she survived said Dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too .Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes .Morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot .Morfin who already had a record of Muggle attacks was sentenced to three years in Azkaban .Marvolo who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden received six months .Marvolo ?Harry repeated wonderingly .Thats right said Dumbledore smiling in approval .I am glad to see youre keeping up .That old man was ?Voldemorts grandfather yes said Dumbledore .Marvolo his son Morfin and his daughter Merope were the last of the Gaunts a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins .Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born .He as you saw was left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son and rather more than his daughter .So Merope said Harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore so Merope was .Sir does that mean she was .Voldemorts mother ?It does said Dumbledore .And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemorts father .I wonder whether you noticed ?The Muggle Morfin attacked ?The man on the horse ?Very good indeed said Dumbledore beaming .Yes that was Tom Riddle senior the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret burning passion .And they ended up married ?Harry said in disbelief unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love .I think you are forgetting said Dumbledore that Merope was a witch .I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father .Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban once she was alone and free for the first time in her life then I am sure she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years .Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion and fall in love with her instead ?The Imperius Curse ?Harry suggested .Or a love potion ?Very good .Personally I am inclined to think that she used a love potion .I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and I do not think it would have been very difficult some hot day when Riddle was riding alone to persuade him to take a drink of water .In any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal .You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squires son ran off with the tramps daughter Merope .But the villagers shock was nothing to Marvolos .He returned from Azkaban expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table .Instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done .From all that I have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth .The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself .Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage .And Merope ?She .she died didnt she ?Wasnt Voldemort brought up in an orphanage ?Yes indeed said Dumbledore .We must do a certain amount of guessing here although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened .You see within a few months of their runaway marriage Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife .The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked and ‘taken in .What he meant I am sure is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane .When they heard what he was saying however the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle pretending that she was going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason .But she did have his baby .But not until a year after they were married .Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant .What went wrong ?asked Harry .Why did the love potion stop working ?Again this is guesswork said Dumbledore but I believe that Merope who was deeply in love with her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means .I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion .Perhaps besotted as she was she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return .Perhaps she thought he would stay for the babys sake .If so she was wrong on both counts .He left her never saw her again and never troubled to discover what became of his son .The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore s office seemed to glow more brightly than before .I think that will do for tonight Harry said Dumbledore after a moment or two .Yes sir said Harry .He got to his feet but did not leave .Sir .is it important to know all this about Voldemorts past ?Very important I think said Dumbledore .And it .its got something to do with the prophecy ?It has everything to do with the prophecy .Right said Harry a little confused but reassured all the same .He turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again .Sir am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything youve told me ?Dumbledore considered him for a moment then said Yes I think Mr Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy .But Harry I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else .It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know or suspect about Lord Voldemorts secrets .No sir Ill make sure its just Ron and Hermione .Good night .He turned away again and was almost at the door when he saw it .Sitting on one of the little spindle legged tables that supported so many fraillooking silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone .Sir said Harry staring at it .That ring Yes ?said Dumbledore .You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night .So I was Dumbledore agreed .But isnt it .sir isnt it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden ?Dumbledore bowed his head .The very same .But how come ?Have you always had it ?No I acquired it very recently said Dumbledore .A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncles in fact .That would be around the time you injured your hand then sir ?Around that time yes Harry .Harry hesitated .Dumbledore was smiling .Sir how exactly ?Too late Harry !You shall hear the story another time .Good night .Good night sir .HERMIONES HELPING HAND As Hermione had predicted the sixth years free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set .Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before .Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice .Incredibly and to Hermione s increasing resentment Harrys best subject had suddenly become Potions thanks to the HalfBlood Prince .Nonverbal spells were now expected not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts but in Charms and Transfiguration too .Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on UNoPoo but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud .It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind .One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry Ron and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid .He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table an ominous sign and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings .Weve got to go and explain said Hermione looking up at Hagrid s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast .Weve got Quidditch tryouts this morning !said Ron .And were supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick !Anyway explain what ?How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject ?We didnt hate it !said Hermione .Speak for yourself I havent forgotten the skrewts said Ron darkly .And Im telling you now weve had a narrow escape .You didnt hear him going on about his gormless brother wed have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if wed stayed .I hate not talking to Hagrid said Hermione looking upset .Well go down after Quidditch Harry assured her .He too was missing Hagrid although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives .But trials might take all morning the number of people who have applied .He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy .I dunno why the teams this popular all of a sudden .Oh come on Harry said Hermione suddenly impatient .Its not Quidditch thats popular its you !Youve never been more interesting and frankly youve never been more fanciable .Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper .Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry .Everyone knows youve been telling the truth now dont they ?The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times .And now theyre calling you ‘the Chosen One well come on cant you see why people are fascinated by you ?Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy .And youve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar .You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway .You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry look said Ron shaking back his sleeves .And it doesnt hurt that youve grown about a foot over the summer either Hermione finished ignoring Ron .Im tall said Ron inconsequentially .The post owls arrived swooping down through rain flecked windows scattering everyone with droplets of water .Most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them in turn that all was well at home .Harry had received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally he had so far been disappointed .He was very surprised therefore to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls .She landed in front of him carrying a large square package .A moment later an identical package landed in front of Ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl Pigwidgeon .Ha !said Harry unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced PotionMaking fresh from Flourish and Blotts .Oh good said Hermione delighted .Now you can give that graffitied copy back .Are you mad ?said Harry .Im keeping it !Look Ive thought it out He pulled the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand muttering Diffindol The cover fell off .He did the same thing with the brandnew book Hermione looked scandalized .He then swapped the covers tapped each and said Reparo There sat the Princes copy disguised as a new book and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts looking thoroughly secondhand .Ill give Slughorn back the new one he cant complain it cost nine Galleons .Hermione pressed her lips together looking angry and disapproving but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that days copy of the Daily Prophet .She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page .Anyone we know dead ?asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper .No but there have been more dementor attacks said Hermione .And an arrest .Excellent who ?said Harry thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange .Stan Shunpike said Hermione .What ?said Harry startled . ‘Stanley Shunpike conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity .Mr Shunpike 21 was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home .Stan Shunpike a Death Eater ?said Harry remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before .No way !He might have been put under the Imperius Curse said Ron reasonably .You never can tell .It doesnt look like it said Hermione who was still reading .It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters secret plans in a pub .She looked up with a troubled expression on her face .If he was under the Imperius Curse hed hardly stand around gossiping about their plans would he ?It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did said Ron .Isnt he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela ?Yeah thats him said Harry .I dunno what theyre playing at taking Stan seriously .They probably want to look as though theyre doing something said Hermione frowning .People are terrified you know the Patil twins parents want them to go home ?And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn .Her father picked her up last night .What !said Ron goggling at Hermione .But Hogwarts is safer than their homes bound to be !Weve got Aurors and all those extra protective spells and weve got Dumbledore !I dont think weve got him all the time said Hermione very quietly glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet Havent you noticed ?His seats been empty as often as Hagrids this past week .Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table .The headmasters chair was indeed empty .Now Harry came to think of it he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago .I think hes left the school to do something with the Order said Hermione in a low voice .I mean .its all looking serious isnt it ?Harry and Ron did not answer but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing .There had been a horrible incident the day before when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead .They had not seen Hannah since .When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil .Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together looking distressed .What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile .Ron blinked at her then returned the smile uncertainly .His walk instantly became something more like a strut .Harry resisted the temptation to laugh remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harrys nose Hermione however looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool misty drizzle and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck .As Harry had expected the trials took most of the morning .Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms to seventh years who towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating .The latter included a large wiryhaired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express .We met on the train in old Sluggys compartment he said confidently stepping out of the crowd to shake Harrys hand .Cormac McLaggen Keeper .You didnt try out last year did you ?asked Harry taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving .I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials said McLaggen with something of a swagger .Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet .Right said Harry .Well .if you wait over there .He pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where Hermione was sitting .He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggens face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both old Sluggys favorites .Harry decided to start with a basic test asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch .This was a good decision The first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before .Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts .The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered who when he blew his whistle merely fell about giggling and clutching one another .Romilda Vane was amongst them .When he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else .The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch .Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks .The fifth group were Hufflepuffs .If theres anyone else here whos not from Gryffindor roared Harry who was starting to get seriously annoyed leave now please !There was a pause then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter .After two hours many complaints and several tantrums one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth Harry had found himself three Chasers Katie Bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new find called Demelza Robins who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers and Ginny Weasley who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot .Pleased though he was with his choices Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters .Thats my final decision and if you dont get out of the way for the Keepers Ill hex you he bellowed .Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George but he was still reasonably pleased with them Jimmy Peakes a short but broadchested thirdyear boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harrys head with a ferociously hit Bludger and Ritchie Coote who looked weedy but aimed well .They now joined Katie Demelza and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member .Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned .Unfortunately however all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it was larger than ever .As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure .Harry glanced over at Ron who had always had a problem with nerves Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not Ron was a delicate shade of green .None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece .To Harrys great disappointment Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five .On the last one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth .Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven .Good luck !cried a voice from the stands .Harry looked around expecting to see Hermione but it was Lavender Brown .He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands as she did a moment later but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch Ron do his trial .Yet he need not have worried Ron saved one two three four five penalties in a row .Delighted and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that most unfortunately Ron had beaten him only to find McLaggens red face inches from his own .He stepped back hastily .His sister didnt really try said McLaggen menacingly .There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernons .She gave him an easy save .Rubbish said Harry coldly .That was the one he nearly missed .McLaggen took a step nearer Harry who stood his ground this time .Give me another go .No said Harry .Youve had your go .You saved four .Ron saved five .Rons Keeper he won it fair and square .Get out of my way .He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away gwhat sounded like threats to thin air .Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him .Well done he croaked .You flew really well You did brilliantly Ron !This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch arm in arm with Parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face .Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione .After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday Harry Ron and Hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrids .A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last .Harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrids .I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty Ron was saying happily .Tricky shot from Demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it Yes yes you were magnificent said Hermione looking amused .I was better than that McLaggen anyway said Ron in a highly satisfied voice .Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth ?Looked like hed been Confunded .To Harrys surprise Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words .Ron noticed nothing he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail .The great gray hippogriff Buckbeak was tethered in front of Hagrids cabin .He clicked his razorsharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them .Oh dear said Hermione nervously .Hes still a bit scary isnt he ?Come off it youve ridden him havent you ?said Ron .Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking .After a few seconds Buckbeak sank into a bow too .How are you ?Harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head .Missing him ?But youre okay here with Hagrid arent you ?Oi !said a loud voice .Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes .His enormous boarhound Fang was at his heels Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward .Git away from him !Hell have yer fingers oh .Its yeh lot .Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron attempting to lick their ears .Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him .Oh dear !said Hermione looking stricken .Dont worry about it said Harry grimly .He walked over to the door and knocked loudly .Hagrid !Open up we want to talk to you !There was no sound from within .If you dont open the door well blast it open !Harry said pulling out his wand .Harry !said Hermione sounding shocked .You cant possibly Yeah I can !said Harry .Stand back But before he could say anything else the door flew open again as Harry had known it would and there stood Hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming .Im a teacher !he roared at Harry .A teacher Potter !How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door ! ‘Tm sorry sir said Harry emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes .Hagrid looked stunned .Since when have yeh called me ‘sir ?Since when have you called me ‘Potter ?Oh very clever growled Hagrid .Very amusin .Thats me outsmarted innit ?All righ come in then yeh ungrateful little .Mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass .Hermione scurried in after Harry looking rather frightened .Well ?said Hagrid grumpily as Harry Ron and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table Fang laying his head immediately upon Harrys knee and drooling all over his robes .Whats this ?Feelin sorry for me ?Reckon Im lonely or summat ?No said Harry at once .We wanted to see you .Weve missed you !said Hermione tremulously .Missed me have yeh ?snorted Hagrid .Yeah .Righ .He stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while .Finally he slammed down three bucketsized mugs of mahoganybrown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes .Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrids cooking and took one at once .Hagrid said Hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures you know .Hagrid gave another great snort .Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner .We did !said Hermione .But none of us could fit it into our schedules !Yeah .Righ said Hagrid again .There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around Hermione let out a tiny shriek and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed .It was full of what looked like footlong maggots slimy white and writhing .What are they Hagrid ?asked Harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but putting down his rock cake all the same .Jus giant grubs said Hagrid .And they grow into . ?said Ron looking apprehensive .They won grow inter nuthin said Hagrid .I got em ter feed ter Aragog .And without warning he burst into tears .Hagrid !cried Hermione leaping up hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders .What is it ?Its .him .gulped Hagrid his beetleblack eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron .Its .Aragog .I think hes dyin .He got ill over the summer an hes not gettin better .I don know what Ill do if he .if he .Weve bin tergether so long .Hermione patted Hagrids shoulder looking at a complete loss for anything to say .Harry knew how she felt .He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a halfbrother but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies the gigantic talking spider Aragog who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously .Is there is there anything we can do ?Hermione asked ignoring Rons frantic grimaces and head shakings .I don think there is Hermione choked Hagrid attempting to stem the flood of his tears .See the rest o the tribe .Aragogs family .theyre gettin a bit funny now hes ill .bit restive .Yeah I think we saw a bit of that side of them said Ron in an undertone . .I don reckon itd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo Hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up .But thanks fer offerin Hermione .It means a lot .After that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous gargantuan spider Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more .Ar I always knew yehd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables he said gruffly pouring them more tea .Even if yeh applied fer TimeTurners We couldnt have done said Hermione .We smashed the entire stock of Ministry TimeTurners when we were there last summer .It was in the Daily Prophet .Ar well then said Hagrid .Theres no way yeh couldve done it .Im sorry Ive bin yeh know Ive jus bin worried abou Aragog .an I did wonder whether if Professor GrubblyPlank had bin teachin yeh At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor GrubblyPlank who had substituted for Hagrid a few times was a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk he looked quite cheerful .Im starving said Harry once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth .And Ive got that detention with Snape tonight I havent got much time for dinner .As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall .It took him two attempts to get through the doors he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt .Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him but Harry caught Hermione s arm and held her back .What ?said Hermione defensively .If you ask me said Harry quietly McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning .And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting .Hermione blushed .Oh all right then I did it she whispered .But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny !Anyway hes got a nasty temper you saw how he reacted when he didnt get in you wouldnt have wanted someone like that on the team .No said Harry .No I suppose thats true .But wasnt that dishonest Hermione ?I mean youre a prefect arent you ?Oh be quiet she snapped as he smirked .What are you two doing ?demanded Ron reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious .Nothing said Harry and Hermione together and they hurried after Ron .The smell of roast beef made Harrys stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path .Harry Harry just the man I was hoping to see !he boomed genially twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly .I was hoping to catch you before dinner !What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead ?Were having a little party just a few rising stars Ive got McLaggen coming and Zabini the charming Melinda Bobbin I dont know whether you know her ?Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries and of course I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too .Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking .It was as though Ron was not present Slughorn did not so much as look at him .I cant come Professor said Harry at once .Ive got a detention with Professor Snape .Oh dear !said Slughorn his face falling comically .Dear dear I was counting on you Harry !Well now Ill just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation .Im sure Ill be able to persuade him to postpone your detention .Yes Ill see you both later !He bustled away out of the Hall .Hes got no chance of persuading Snape said Harry the moment Slughorn was out of earshot .This detentions already been postponed once Snape did it for Dumbledore but he wont do it for anyone else .Oh I wish you could come I dont want to go on my own !said Hermione anxiously Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen .I doubt youll be alone Ginnyll probably be invited snapped Ron who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn .After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower .The common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down Ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling .Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair .Anything new ?said Harry .Not really .Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages .Oh look your dads in here Ron hes all right !she added quickly for Ron had looked around in alarm .It just says hes been to visit the Malfoys house . ‘This second search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results .Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tipoff Yeah mine !said Harry .I told him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix !Well if its not at their house he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him But how can he have done Harry ?said Hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprised look .We were all searched when we arrived werent we ?Were you ?said Harry taken aback .I wasnt !Oh no of course you werent I forgot you were late . .Well Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall .Any Dark object would have been found I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated .So you see Malfoy cant have brought in anything dangerous !Momentarily stymied Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection .Someones sent it to him by owl then he said .His mother or someone .All the owls are being checked too said Hermione .Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach .Really stumped this time Harry found nothing else to say .There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school .He looked hopefully at Ron who was sitting with his arms folded staring over at Lavender Brown .Can you think of any way Malfoy ?Oh drop it Harry said Ron .Listen its not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party neither of us wanted to go you know !said Harry firing up .Well as Im not invited to any parties said Ron getting to his feet again I think Ill go to bed .He stomped off toward the door to the boys dormitories leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him .Harry ?said the new Chaser Demelza Robins appearing suddenly at his shoulder .Ive got a message for you .From Professor Slughorn ?asked Harry sitting up hopefully .No .from Professor Snape said Demelza .Harrys heart sank .He says youre to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention er no matter how many party invitations youve received .And he wanted you to know youll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones to use in Potions and and he says theres no need to bring protective gloves .Right said Harry grimly .Thanks a lot Demelza .SILVER AND OPALS Where was Dumbledore and what was he doing ?Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks .He rarely appeared at meals anymore and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time .Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry ?Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy Harry had felt bolstered comforted and now he felt slightly abandoned .Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade .Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed given the increasingly tight security measures around the school but was pleased to know that they were going ahead it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours .Harry woke early on the morning of the trip which was proving stormy and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion Making .He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks that sort of behavior as Ron rightly said was indecent in anybody except Hermione who was simply weird that way .Harry felt however that the HalfBlood Princes copy of Advanced PotionMaking hardly qualified as a textbook .The more Harry pored over the book the more he realized how much was in there not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins which Harry was sure judging by the crossingsout and revisions that the Prince had invented himself .Harry had already attempted a few of the Princes self invented spells .There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor with very entertaining results a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth which he had twice used to general applause on an unsuspecting Argus Filch and perhaps most useful of all Muffliato a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard .The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity .Sitting up in bed Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble .There were many crossingsout and alterations but finally crammed into a corner of the page the scribble Levicorpus nvbl While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows and Neville snored loudly Harry stared at the letters in brackets .Nvbl .that had to mean nonverbal .Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D .A .D .A .class .On the other hand the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far .Pointing his wand at nothing in particular he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpusl inside his head .aargh !There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell .Harry sent Advanced PotionMaking flying in panic Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle .Sorry !yelled Harry as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter and Neville picked himself up from the floor having fallen out of bed .Hang on Ill let you down He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell Praying that this was the counterjinx Harry thought Liberacorpus with all his might .There was another flash of light and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress .Sorry repeated Harry weakly while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter .Tomorrow said Ron in a muffled voice Id rather you set the alarm clock .By the time they had got dressed padding themselves out with several of Mrs Weasleys handknitted sweaters and carrying cloaks scarves and gloves Rons shock had subsided and he had decided that Harrys new spell was highly amusing so amusing in fact that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast . .and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again !Ron grinned helping himself to sausages .Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry .Was this spell by any chance another one from that potion book of yours ?she asked .Harry frowned at her .Always jump to the worst conclusion dont you ?Was it ?Well .yeah it was but so what ?So you just decided to try out an unknown handwritten incantation and see what would happen ?Why does it matter if its handwritten ?said Harry preferring not to answer the rest of the question .Because its probably not Ministry of Magic approved said Hermione .And also she added as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes because Im starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy .Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once .It was a laugh !said Ron upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages .Just a laugh Hermione thats all !Dangling people upside down by the ankle ?said Hermione .Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that ?Fred and George said Ron shrugging its their kind of thing .And er My dad said Harry .He had only just remembered .What ?said Ron and Hermione together .My dad used this spell said Harry .I Lupin told me .This last part was not true in fact Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve .Now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him .Could the Half Blood Prince possibly be ?Maybe your dad did use it Harry said Hermione but hes not the only one .Weve seen a whole bunch of people use it in case youve forgotten .Dangling people in the air .Making them float along asleep helpless .Harry stared at her .With a sinking feeling he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup .Ron came to his aid .That was different he said robustly .They were abusing it .Harry and his dad were just having a laugh .You dont like the Prince Hermione he added pointing a sausage at her sternly because hes better than you at Potions Its got nothing to do with that !said Hermione her cheeks reddening .I just think its very irresponsible to start performing spells when you dont even know what theyre for and stop talking about ‘the Prince as if its his title I bet its just a stupid nickname and it doesnt seem as though he was a very nice person to me !I dont see where you get that from said Harry heatedly .If hed been a budding Death Eater he wouldnt have been boasting about being ‘halfblood would he ?Even as he said it Harry remembered that his father had been pureblood but he pushed the thought out of his mind he would worry about that later .The Death Eaters cant all be pureblood there arent enough pureblood wizards left said Hermione stubbornly .I expect most of them are halfbloods pretending to be pure .Its only Muggleborns they hate theyd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up .There is no way theyd let me be a Death Eater !said Ron indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head .My whole family are blood traitors !Thats as bad as Muggleborns to Death Eaters !And theyd love to have me said Harry sarcastically .Wed be best pals if they didnt keep trying to do me in .This made Ron laugh even Hermione gave a grudging smile and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny .Hey Harry Im supposed to give you this .It was a scroll of parchment with Harrys name written upon it in familiar thin slanting writing .Thanks Ginny .Its Dumbledores next lesson !Harry told Ron and Hermione pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents .Monday evening !He felt suddenly light and happy .Want to join us in Hogsmeade Ginny ?he asked .Im going with Dean might see you there she replied waving at them as she left .Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade .The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triplechecking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor .What does it matter if were smuggling Dark stuff OUT ?demanded Ron eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension .Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN ?His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet .The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable .Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb .The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind .More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonkos Joke Shop had been boarded up Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun .Ron pointed with a thickly gloved hand toward Honeydukes which was mercifully open and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop .Thank God shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm toffeescented air .Lets stay here all afternoon .Harry mboy !said a booming voice from behind them .Oh no muttered Harry .The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop .Harry thats three of my little suppers youve missed now !said Slughorn poking him genially in the chest .It wont do mboy Im determined to have you !Miss Granger loves them dont you ?Yes said Hermione helplessly theyre really So why dont you come along Harry ?demanded Slughorn .Well Ive had Quidditch practice Professor said Harry who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little violet ribbonadorned invitation .This strategy meant that Ron was not left out and they usually had a laugh with Ginny imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini .Well I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work !said Slughorn .But a little recreation never hurt anybody .Now how about Monday night you cant possibly want to practice in this weather .I cant Professor Ive got er an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening .Unlucky again !cried Slughorn dramatically .Ah well .you cant evade me forever Harry !And with a regal wave he waddled out of the shop taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters .I cant believe youve wriggled out of another one said Hermione shaking her head .Theyre not that bad you know .Theyre even quite fun sometimes . .But then she caught sight of Rons expression .Oh look theyve got deluxe sugar quills those would last hours !Glad that Hermione had changed the subject Harry showed much more interest in the new extralarge sugar quills than he would normally have done but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next .Lets go to the Three Broomsticks said Harry .Itll be warm .They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop .The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes .The street was not very busy nobody was lingering to chat just hurrying toward their destinations .The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them standing just outside the Three Broomsticks .One was very tall and thin squinting through his rainwashed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub the Hogs Head .As Harry Ron and Hermione drew closer the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms .They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was .Mundungus !The squat bandylegged man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase which burst open releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window .Oh ello Arry said Mundungus Fletcher with a most unconvincing stab at airiness .Well dont let me keep ya .And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone .Are you selling this stuff ?asked Harry watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubbylooking objects from the ground .Oh well gotta scrape a living said Mundungus .Gimme that !Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver .Hang on Ron said slowly .This looks familiar Thank you !said Mundungus snatching the goblet out of Rons hand and stuffing it back into the case .Well Ill see you all OUCH !Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat .Holding him fast with one hand he pulled out his wand .Harry !squealed Hermione .You took that from Siriuss house said Harry who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits .That had the Black family crest on it .I no what ?spluttered Mundungus who was slowly turning purple .What did you do go back the night he died and strip the place ?snarled Harry .I no Give it to me !Harry you mustnt !shrieked Hermione as Mundungus started to turn blue .There was a bang and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundunguss throat .Gasping and spluttering Mundungus seized his fallen case then CRACK he Disapparated .Harry swore at the top of his voice spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone .COME BACK YOU THIEVING !Theres no point Harry .Tonks had appeared out of nowhere her mousy hair wet with sleet .Mundungus will probably be in London by now .Theres no point yelling .Hes nicked Siriuss stuff !Nicked it !Yes but still said Tonks who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information .You should get out of the cold .She watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks .The moment he was inside Harry burst out He was nicking Siriuss stuff .I know Harry but please dont shout people are staring whispered Hermione .Go and sit down Ill get you a drink .Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer .Cant the Order control Mundungus ?Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper .Cant they at least stop him stealing everything thats not fixed down when hes at headquarters ?Shh !said Hermione desperately looking around to make sure nobody was listening there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away .Harry Id be annoyed too I know its your things hes stealing Harry gagged on his butterbeer he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve Grimmauld Place .Yeah its my stuff !he said .No wonder he wasnt pleased to see me !Well Im going to tell Dumbledore whats going on hes the only one who scares Mundungus .Good idea whispered Hermione clearly pleased that Harry was calming down .Ron what are you staring at ?Nothing said Ron hastily looking away from the bar but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid Madam Rosmerta for whom he had long nursed a soft spot .I expect ‘nothings in the back getting more firewhisky said Hermione waspishly .Ron ignored this jibe sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence .Harry was thinking about Sirius and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway .Hermione drummed her fingers on the table her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar .The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said Shall we call it a day and go back to school then ?The other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed .Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them rearranged their scarves pulled on their gloves then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street .Harrys thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush .They had not met up with her undoubtedly thought Harry because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop that haunt of happy couples .Scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on .It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend which were being carried back to him on the wind had become shriller and louder .Harry squinted at their indistinct figures .The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand .Its nothing to do with you Leanne !Harry heard Katie say .They rounded a corner in the lane sleet coming thick and fast blurring Harrys glasses .Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground .At once Katie rose into the air not as Ron had done suspended comically by the ankle but gracefully her arms outstretched as though she was about to fly .Yet there was something wrong something eerie .Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression .Harry Ron Hermione and Leanne had all halted in their tracks watching .Then six feet above the ground Katie let out a terrible scream .Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see or whatever she was feeling was clearly causing her terrible anguish .She screamed and screamed Leanne started to scream too and seized Katies ankles trying to tug her back to the ground .Harry Ron and Hermione rushed forward to help but even as they grabbed Katies legs she fell on top of them Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her .Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them .Harry looked around the landscape seemed deserted .Stay there !he shouted at the others over the howling wind .Im going for help !He began to sprint toward the school he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs .Hagrid !he panted disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen .Harry !said Hagrid who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard and was wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat .Jus bin visitin Grawp hes cornin on so well yeh wouldn Hagrid someones hurt back there or cursed or something Wha ?said Hagrid bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind .Someones been cursed !bellowed Harry .Cursed ?Whos bin cursed not Ron ?Hermione ?No its not them its Katie Bell this way .Together they ran back along the lane .It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie who was still writhing and screaming on the ground Ron Hermione and Leanne were all trying to quiet her .Get back !shouted Hagrid .Lemme see her !Somethings happened to her !sobbed Leanne .I dont know what Hagrid stared at Katie for a second then without a word bent down scooped her into his arms and ran off toward the castle with her .Within seconds Katies piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind .Hermione hurried over to Katies wailing friend and put an arm around her .Its Leanne isnt it ?The girl nodded .Did it just happen all of a sudden or ?It was when that package tore sobbed Leanne pointing at the now sodden brownpaper package on the ground which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter .Ron bent down his hand outstretched but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back .Dont touch if !He crouched down .An ornate opal necklace was visible poking out of the paper .Ive seen that before said Harry staring at the thing .It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago .The label said it was cursed .Katie must have touched it .He looked up at Leanne who had started to shake uncontrollably .How did Katie get hold of this ?Well thats why we were arguing .She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it .She looked all funny when she said it .Oh no oh no I bet shed been Imperiused and I didnt realize !Leanne shook with renewed sobs .Hermione patted her shoulder gently .She didnt say whod given it to her Leanne ?No .she wouldnt tell me .and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school but she just wouldnt listen and .and then I tried to grab it from her .and and Leanne let out a wail of despair .Wed better get up to school said Hermione her arm still around Leanne .Well be able to find out how she is .Come on .Harry hesitated for a moment then pulled his scarf from around his face and ignoring Rons gasp carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up .Well need to show this to Madam Pomfrey he said .As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road Harry was thinking furiously .They had just entered the grounds when he spoke unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer .Malfoy knows about this necklace .It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad .This is what he was buying that day when we followed him !He remembered it and he went back for it !I I dunno Harry said Ron hesitantly .Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes .and didnt that girl say Katie got it in the girls bathroom ?She said she came back from the bathroom with it she didnt necessarily get it in the bathroom itself McGonagall !said Ron warningly .Harry looked up .Sure enough Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them .Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell upstairs to my office at once please !Whats that youre holding Potter ?Its the thing she touched said Harry .Good lord said Professor McGonagall looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry .No no Filch theyre with me !she added hastily as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft .Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf !Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office .The sleetspattered windows were rattling in their frames and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate .Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry Ron Hermione and the still sobbing Leanne .Well ?she said sharply .What happened ?Haltingly and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package how Katie had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel which tore open .At this point Leanne was so overcome there was no getting another word out of her .All right said Professor McGonagall not unkindly go up to the hospital wing please Leanne and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock .When she had left the room Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry Ron and Hermione .What happened when Katie touched the necklace ?She rose up in the air said Harry before either Ron or Hermione could speak and then began to scream and collapsed .Professor can I see Professor Dumbledore please ?The headmaster is away until Monday Potter said Professor McGonagall looking surprised .Away ?Harry repeated angrily .Yes Potter away !said Professor McGonagall tartly .But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me Im sure !For a split second Harry hesitated .Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences Dumbledore though in many ways more intimidating still seemed less likely to scorn a theory however wild .This was a lifeanddeath matter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at .I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace Professor .On one side of him Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment on the other Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry .That is a very serious accusation Potter said Professor McGonagall after a shocked pause .Do you have any proof ?No said Harry but .and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr Borgin .When he had finished speaking Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused .Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair ?No Professor he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something he didnt have it with him .But thats not the point the thing is that he bought something at the same time and I think it was that necklace You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package ?No Professor he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him But Harry Hermione interrupted Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and Malfoy said no Because he didnt want to touch it obviously !said Harry angrily .What he actually said was ‘How would I look carrying that down the street ?said Hermione .Well he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace interjected Ron .Oh Ron said Hermione despairingly it would be all wrapped up so he wouldnt have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would see it !I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street and in any case she pressed on loudly before Harry could interrupt I asked Borgin about the necklace dont you remember ?When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep I saw it there .And Borgin just told me the price he didnt say it was already sold or anything Well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five seconds of course he wasnt going to tell you anyway Malfoy couldve sent off for it since Thats enough !said Professor McGonagall as Hermione opened her mouth to retort looking furious .Potter I appreciate you telling me this but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased .The same is probably true of hundreds of people thats what I said muttered Ron .and in any case we have put stringent security measures in place this year .I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge But and what is more said Professor McGonagall with an air of awful finality Mr Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today .Harry gaped at her deflating .How do you know Professor ?Because he was doing detention with me .He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row .So thank you for telling me your suspicions Potter she said as she marched past them but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell .Good day to you all .She held open her office door .They had no choice but to file past her without another word .Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall nevertheless he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened .So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to ?asked Ron as they climbed the stairs to the common room .Goodness only knows said Hermione .But whoever it was has had a narrow escape .No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace .It couldve been meant for loads of people said Harry .Dumbledore the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top targets .Or Slughorn Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they cant be pleased that hes sided with Dumbledore .Or Or you said Hermione looking troubled .Couldnt have been said Harry or Katie wouldve just turned around in the lane and given it to me wouldnt she ?I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks .It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out .I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle ?Harry Malfoy wasnt in Hogsmeade !said Hermione actually stamping her foot in frustration .He must have used an accomplice then said Harry .Crabbe or Goyle or come to think of it another Death Eater hell have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now hes joined up Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said Theres no point arguing with him .Dilligrout said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady .The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room .It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather .There was no buzz of fear or speculation however Clearly the news of Katies fate had not yet spread .It wasnt a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it said Ron casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down .The curse didnt even make it into the castle .Not what youd call foolproof .Youre right said Hermione prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again .It wasnt very well thoughtout at all .But since when has Malfoy been one of the worlds great thinkers ?asked Harry .Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him .THE SECRET RIDDLE Katie was removed to St .Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry Ron Hermione and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target .Oh and Malfoy knows of course said Harry to Ron and Hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his MalfoyIsaDeathEater theory .Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday nights lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside Dumbledore s office at eight oclock knocked and was told to enter .There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand was as black and burned as ever but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down .The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling .You have had a busy time while I have been away Dumbledore said .I believe you witnessed Katies accident .Yes sir .How is she ?Still very unwell although she was relatively lucky .She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin There was a tiny hole in her glove .Had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly .Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse Why him ?asked Harry quickly .Why not Madam Pomfrey ?Impertinent said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall and Phineas Nigellus Black Siriuss greatgreatgrandfather raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping .I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day .Yes thank you Phineas said Dumbledore quellingly .Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey Harry .Anyway the St .Mungos staff are sending me hourly reports and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time .Where were you this weekend sir ?Harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus who hissed softly .I would rather not say just now said Dumbledore .However I shall tell you in due course .You will ?said Harry startled .Yes I expect so said Dumbledore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand .Sir said Harry tentatively I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade .Ah yes I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with lightfingered contempt said Dumbledore frowning a little .He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks I rather think he dreads facing me .However rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Siriuss old possessions .That mangy old halfblood has been stealing Black heirlooms ?said Phineas Nigellus incensed and he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve Grimmauld Place .Professor said Harry after a short pause did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt ?About Draco Malfoy ?She told me of your suspicions yes said Dumbledore .And do you ?I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katies accident said Dumbledore .But what concerns me now Harry is our lesson .Harry felt slightly resentful at this If their lessons were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second ?However he said no more about Draco Malfoy but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his longfingered hands .You will remember I am sure that we left the tale of Lord Voldemorts beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle Tom Riddle had abandoned his witch wife Merope and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton .Merope was left alone in London expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort .How do you know she was in London sir ?Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke said Dumbledore who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing .He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before much as a gold prospector sifts for gold .Up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes .Yes we acquired it in curious circumstances .It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas oh many years ago now .She said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious .Covered in rags and pretty far along .Going to have a baby see .She said the locket had been Slytherins .Well we hear that sort of story all the time ‘Oh this was Merlins this was his favorite teapot but when I looked at it it had his mark all right and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth .Of course that made it near enough priceless .She didnt seem to have any idea how much it was worth .Happy to get ten Galleons for it .Best bargain we ever made !Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extravigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come .He only gave her ten Galleons ?said Harry indignantly .Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity said Dumbledore .So we know that near the end of her pregnancy Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that was one of Marvolos treasured family heirlooms .But she could do magic !said Harry impatiently .She could have got food and everything for herself by magic couldnt she ?Ah said Dumbledore perhaps she could .But it is my belief I am guessing again but I am sure I am right that when her husband abandoned her Merope stopped using magic .I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer .Of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen .In any case as you are about to see Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life .She wouldnt even stay alive for her son ?Dumbledore raised his eyebrows .Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort ?No said Harry quickly but she had a choice didnt she not like my mother Your mother had a choice too said Dumbledore gently .Yes Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly Harry .She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mothers courage .And now if you will stand .Where are we going ?Harry asked as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk .This time said Dumbledore we are going to enter my memory .I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate .After you Harry .Harry bent over the Pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again .Seconds later his feet hit firm ground he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling old fashioned London street .There I am said Dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horsedrawn milk cart .This younger Albus Dumbledore s long hair and beard were auburn .Having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing .Nice suit sir said Harry before he could stop himself but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building surrounded by high railings .He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once .After a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron .Good afternoon .I have an appointment with a Mrs Cole who I believe is the matron here ?Oh said the bewilderedlooking girl taking in Dumbledore s eccentric appearance .Um .just a mo .MRS COLE !she bellowed over her shoulder .Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response .The girl turned back to Dumbledore .Come in shes on er way .Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean .Harry and the older Dumbledore followed .Before the front door had closed behind them a skinny harassedlooking woman came scurrying toward them .She had a sharpfeatured face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore . .and take the iodine upstairs to Martha Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalleys oozing all over his sheets chicken pox on top of everything else she said to nobody in particular and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold .Good afternoon said Dumbledore holding out his hand .Mrs Cole simply gaped .My name is Albus Dumbledore .I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today .Mrs Cole blinked .Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination she said feebly Oh yes .Well well then youd better come into my room .Yes .She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room part office .It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched .She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously .I am here as I told you in my letter to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future said Dumbledore .Are you family ?asked Mrs Cole .No I am a teacher said Dumbledore .I have come to offer Tom a place at my school .What schools this then ?It is called Hogwarts said Dumbledore .And how come youre interested in Tom ?We believe he has qualities we are looking for .You mean hes won a scholarship ?How can he have done ?Hes never been entered for one .Well his name has been down for our school since birth Who registered him ?His parents ?There was no doubt that Mrs Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman .Apparently Dumbledore thought so too for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs Coles desktop .Here said Dumbledore waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper I think this will make everything clear .Mrs Coles eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment .That seems perfectly in order she said placidly handing it back .Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before .Er may I offer you a glass of gin ?she said in an extrarefined voice .Thank you very much said Dumbledore beaming .It soon became clear that Mrs Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking .Pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp .Smacking her lips frankly she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time and he didnt hesitate to press his advantage .I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddles history ?I think he was born here in the orphanage ?Thats right said Mrs Cole helping herself to more gin .I remember it clear as anything because Id just started here myself .New Years Eve and bitter cold snowing you know .Nasty night .And this girl not much older than I was myself at the time came staggering up the front steps .Well she wasnt the first .We took her in and she had the baby within the hour .And she was dead in another hour .Mrs Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin .Did she say anything before she died ?asked Dumbledore .Anything about the boys father for instance ?Now as it happens she did said Mrs Cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story .I remember she said to me ‘I hope he looks like his papa and I wont lie she was right to hope it because she was no beauty and then she told me he was to be named Tom for his father and Marvolo for her father yes I know funny name isnt it ?We wondered whether she came from a circus and she said the boys surname was to be Riddle .And she died soon after that without another word .Well we named him just as shed said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and hes been here ever since .Mrs Cole helped herself almost absentmindedly to another healthy measure of gin .Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones .Then she said Hes a funny boy .Yes said Dumbledore .I thought he might be .He was a funny baby too .He hardly ever cried you know .And then when he got a little older he was .odd .Odd in what way ?asked Dumbledore gently .Well he But Mrs Cole pulled up short and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass .Hes definitely got a place at your school you say ?Definitely said Dumbledore .And nothing I say can change that ?Nothing said Dumbledore .Youll be taking him away whatever ?Whatever repeated Dumbledore gravely .She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him .Apparently she decided she could because she said in a sudden rush He scares the other children .You mean he is a bully ?asked Dumbledore .I think he must be said Mrs Cole frowning slightly but its very hard to catch him at it .There have been incidents .Nasty things .Dumbledore did not press her though Harry could tell that he was interested .She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still .Billy Stubbss rabbit .well Tom said he didnt do it and I dont see how he could have done but even so it didnt hang itself from the rafters did it ?I shouldnt think so no said Dumbledore quietly .But Im jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it .All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before .And then Mrs Cole took another swig of gin slopping a little over her chin this time on the summer outing we take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seaside well Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them was that theyd gone into a cave with Tom Riddle .He swore theyd just gone exploring but something happened in there Im sure of it .And well there have been a lot of things funny things .She looked around at Dumbledore again and though her cheeks were flushed her gaze was steady .I dont think many people will be sorry to see the back of him .You understand Im sure that we will not be keeping him permanently ?said Dumbledore .He will have to return here at the very least every summer .Oh well thats better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker said Mrs Cole with a slight hiccup .She got to her feet and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady even though twothirds of the gin was now gone .I suppose youd like to see him ?Very much said Dumbledore rising too .She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed .The orphans Harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic .They looked reasonably wellcared for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up .Here we are said Mrs Cole as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor .She knocked twice and entered .Tom ?Youve got a visitor .This is Mr Dumberton sorry Dunderbore .Hes come to tell you well Ill let him do it .Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room and Mrs Cole closed the door on them .It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe a wooden chair and an iron bedstead .A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book .There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddles face .Merope had got her dying wish He was his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven years old darkhaired and pale .His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledores eccentric appearance .There was a moments silence .How do you do Tom ?said Dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand .The boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands .Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor .I am Professor Dumbledore . ‘Professor ?repeated Riddle .He looked wary .Is that like ‘doctor ?What are you here for ?Did she get you in to have a look at me ?He was pointing at the door through which Mrs Cole had just left .No no said Dumbledore smiling .I dont believe you said Riddle .She wants me looked at doesnt she ?Tell the truth !He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking .It was a command and it sounded as though he had given it many times before .His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly .After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring though he looked if anything warier still .Who are you ?I have told you .My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts .I have come to offer you a place at my school your new school if you would like to come .Riddles reaction to this was most surprising .He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore looking furious .You cant kid me !The asylum thats where youre from isnt it ? ‘Professor yes of course well Im not going see ?That old cats the one who should be in the asylum .I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop and you can ask them theyll tell you !I am not from the asylum said Dumbledore patiently .I am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly I shall tell you about Hogwarts .Of course if you would rather not come to the school nobody will force you Id like to see them try sneered Riddle .Hogwarts Dumbledore went on as though he had not heard Riddles last words is a school for people with special abilities Im not mad !I know that you are not mad .Hogwarts is not a school for mad people .It is a school of magic .There was silence .Riddle had frozen his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledores as though trying to catch one of them lying .Magic ?he repeated in a whisper .Thats right said Dumbledore .Its .its magic what I can do ?What is it that you can do ?All sorts breathed Riddle .A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks he looked fevered .I can make things move without touching them .I can make animals do what I want them to do without training them .I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me .I can make them hurt if I want to .His legs were trembling .He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hands his head bowed as though in prayer .I knew I was different he whispered to his own quivering fingers .I knew I was special .Always I knew there was something .Well you were quite right said Dumbledore who was no longer smiling but watching Riddle intently .You are a wizard .Riddle lifted his head .His face was transfigured There was a wild happiness upon it yet for some reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial .Are you a wizard too ?Yes I am .Prove it said Riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said Tell the truth .Dumbledore raised his eyebrows .If as I take it you are accepting your place at Hogwarts Of course I am !Then you will address me as ‘Professor or ‘sir .Riddles expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice Im sorry sir .I meant please Professor could you show me ?Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious .To his great surprise however Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick .The wardrobe burst into flames .Riddle jumped to his feet Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there .But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore the flames vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged .Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at the wand .Where can I get one of them ?All in good time said Dumbledore .I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe .And sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it .For the first time Riddle looked frightened .Open the door said Dumbledore .Riddle hesitated then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door .On the topmost shelf above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it .Take it out said Dumbledore .Riddle took down the quaking box .He looked unnerved .Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have ?asked Dumbledore .Riddle threw Dumbledore a long clear calculating look .Yes I suppose so sir he said finally in an expressionless voice .Open it said Dumbledore .Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them .Harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of small everyday objects a yoyo a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth organ among them .Once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets .You will return them to their owners with your apologies said Dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket .I shall know whether it has been done .And be warned Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts .Riddle did not look remotely abashed he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore .At last he said in a colorless voice Yes sir .At Hogwarts Dumbledore went on we teach you not only to use magic but to control it .You have inadvertently I am sure been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school .You are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you .But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students and the Ministry of Magic yes there is a Ministry will punish lawbreakers still more severely .All new wizards must accept that in entering our world they abide by our laws .Yes sir said Riddle again .It was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box .When he had finished he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly I havent got any money .That is easily remedied said Dumbledore drawing a leather moneypouch from his pocket .There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes .You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but Where do you buy spellbooks ?interrupted Riddle who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore and was now examining a fat gold Galleon .In Diagon Alley said Dumbledore .I have your list of books and school equipment with me .I can help you find everything Youre coming with me ?asked Riddle looking up .Certainly if you I dont need you said Riddle .Im used to doing things for myself I go round London on my own all the time .How do you get to this Diagon Alley sir ?he added catching Dumbledore s eye .Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle but once again he was surprised .Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage he said You will be able to see it although Muggles around you nonmagical people that is will not .Ask for Tom the barman easy enough to remember as he shares your name Riddle gave an irritable twitch as though trying to displace an irksome fly .You dislike the name Tom ?There are a lot of Toms muttered Riddle .Then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked Was my father a wizard ?He was called Tom Riddle too theyve told me .Im afraid I dont know said Dumbledore his voice gentle .My mother cant have been magic or she wouldnt have died said Riddle more to himself than Dumbledore .It mustve been him .So when Ive got all my stuff when do I come to this Hogwarts ?All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope said Dumbledore .You will leave from Kings Cross Station on the first of September .There is a train ticket in there too .Riddle nodded .Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again .Taking it Riddle said I can speak to snakes .I found out when weve been to the country on trips they find me they whisper to me .Is that normal for a wizard ?Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress .It is unusual said Dumbledore after a moments hesitation but not unheard of .His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddles face .They stood for a moment man and boy staring at each other .Then the handshake was broken Dumbledore was at the door .Goodbye Tom .I shall see you at Hogwarts .I think that will do said the whitehaired Dumbledore at Harrys side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the presentday office .Sit down said Dumbledore landing beside Harry .Harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen .He believed it much quicker than I did I mean when you told him he was a wizard said Harry .I didnt believe Hagrid at first when he told me .Yes Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was to use his word ‘special said Dumbledore .Did you know then ?asked Harry .Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time ?said Dumbledore .No I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is .However I was certainly intrigued by him .I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something I should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already I felt I ought to do for others sake as much as his .His powers as you heard were surprisingly well developed for such a young wizard and most interestingly and ominously of all he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously .And as you saw they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards He was already using magic against other people to frighten to punish to control .The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive . ‘I can make them hurt if I want to .And he was a Parselmouth interjected Harry .Yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts although as we know there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too .In fact his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty secrecy and domination .Time is making fools of us again said Dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the windows .But before we part I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings .Firstly I hope you noticed Riddles reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name Tom ?Harry nodded .There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that made him ordinary .Even then he wished to be different separate notorious .He shed his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort behind which he has been hidden for so long .I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly selfsufficient secretive and apparently friendless ?He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley .He preferred to operate alone .The adult Voldemort is the same .You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him .They are deluded .Lord Voldemort has never had a friend nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one .And lastly I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this Harry the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies .You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room .These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior souvenirs if you will of particularly unpleasant bits of magic .Bear in mind this magpielike tendency for this particularly will be important later .And now it really is time for bed .Harry got to his feet .As he walked across the room his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunts ring had rested last time but the ring was no longer there .Yes Harry ?said Dumbledore for Harry had come to a halt .The rings gone said Harry looking around .But I thought you might have the mouth organ or something .Dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his halfmoon spectacles .Very astute Harry but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ .And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry who understood himself to be dismissed .FELIX FELICIS Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning .He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses .The weekends brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse .Wow scary thought the boy YouKnowWho said Ron quietly as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project and began pulling on their protective gloves .But I still dont get why Dumbledores showing you all this .I mean its really interesting and everything but whats the point ?Dunno said Harry inserting a gum shield .But he says its all important and itll help me survive .I think its fascinating said Hermione earnestly .It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible .How else will you find out his weaknesses ?So how was Slughorns latest party ?Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield .Oh it was quite fun really said Hermione now putting on protective goggles .I mean he drones on about famous expupils a bit and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because hes so wellconnected but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones .Gwenog Jones ?said Ron his eyes widening under his own goggles .The Gwenog Jones ?Captain of the Holyhead Harpies ?Thats right said Hermione .Personally I thought she was a bit full of herself but Quite enough chat over here !said Professor Sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern .Youre lagging behind everybody else has started and Nevilles already got his first pod !They looked around sure enough there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit .Okay Professor were starting now !said Ron adding quietly when she had turned away again shouldve used Muffliato Harry .No we shouldnt !said Hermione at once looking as she always did intensely cross at the thought of the HalfBlood Prince and his spells .Well come on .wed better get going .She gave the other two an apprehensive look they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them .It sprang to life at once long prickly bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air .One tangled itself in Hermiones hair and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole which closed like a trap around her elbow Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines forcing the hole to open again and Hermione snatched her arm free clutching in her fingers a pod just like Nevilles .At once the prickly vines shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood .You know I dont think Ill be having any of these in my garden when Ive got my own place said Ron pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face .Pass me a bowl said Hermione holding the pulsating pod at arms length Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face .Dont be squeamish squeeze it out theyre best when theyre fresh !called Professor Sprout .Anyway said Hermione continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them Slughorns going to have a Christmas party Harry and theres no way youll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come .Harry groaned .Meanwhile Ron who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it standing up and squashing it as hard as he could said angrily And this is another party just for Slughorns favorites is it ?Just for the Slug Club yes said Hermione .The pod flew out from under Rons fingers and hit the greenhouse glass rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprouts head and knocking off her old patched hat .Harry went to retrieve the pod when he got back Hermione was saying Look didnt make up the name ‘Slug Club ‘Slug Club repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy .Its pathetic .Well I hope you enjoy your party .Why dont you try hooking up with McLaggen then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug Were allowed to bring guests said Hermione who for some reason had turned a bright boiling scarlet and I was going to ask you to come but if you think its that stupid then I wont bother !Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them .Unnoticed by either he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation .You were going to ask me ?asked Ron in a completely different voice .Yes said Hermione angrily .But obviously if youd rather I hooked up with McLaggen .There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel .No I wouldnt said Ron in a very quiet voice .Harry missed the pod hit the bowl and shattered it .Reparo he said hastily poking the pieces with his wand and the bowl sprang back together again .The crash however appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harrys presence .Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of FleshEating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods Ron on the other hand looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself .Hand that over Harry said Hermione hurriedly .It says were supposed to puncture them with something sharp .Harry passed her the pod in the bowl he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived once more for the stump .It was not as though he was really surprised thought Harry as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later .But he was not sure how he felt about it .He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if Ron and Hermione started going out together then split up ?Could their friendship survive it ?Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them .And then what if they didnt split up ?What if they became like Bill and Fleur and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence so that he was shut out for good ?Gotcha !yelled Ron pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms .The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorns party .Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual .Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorns dimly lit room on the night of the party .In the meantime however he had more pressing worries .Katie Bell was still in St .Mungos Hospital with no prospect of leaving which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short .He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return but their opening match against Slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play .Harry did not think he could stand another full House tryout .With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day .Most of the class had already left although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room all of Hermione s creation nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air .Are you still interested in playing Chaser ?Wha ?Yeah of course !said Dean excitedly .Over Deans shoulder Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his bag looking sour .One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it .On the other hand he had to do what was best for the team and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts .Well then youre in said Harry .Theres a practice tonight seven oclock .Right said Dean .Cheers Harry !Blimey I cant wait to tell Ginny !He sprinted out of the room leaving Harry and Seamus alone together an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamuss head as one of Hermiones canaries whizzed over them .Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katies substitute .There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team .As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career he was not particularly bothered but all the same the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin .If Gryffindor won Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team .If they lost .well Harry thought wryly he had still endured worse mutterings .Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening he worked well with Ginny and Demelza .The Beaters Peakes and Coote were getting better all the time .The only problem was Ron .Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence and unfortunately the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities .After letting in half a dozen goals most of them scored by Ginny his technique became wilder and wilder until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth .It was an accident Im sorry Demelza really sorry !Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground dripping blood everywhere .I just Panicked Ginny said angrily landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip .You prat Ron look at the state of her !I can fix that said Harry landing beside the two girls pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth and saying Episkey .And Ginny dont call Ron a prat youre not the Captain of this team Well you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should Harry forced himself not to laugh .In the air everyone lets go .Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match .Good work everyone I think well flatten Slytherin he said bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves .I played like a sack of dragon dung said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny .No you didnt said Harry firmly .Youre the best Keeper I tried out Ron .Your only problem is nerves .He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle and by the time they reached the second floor Ron was looking marginally more cheerful .When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower however they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together .It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harrys stomach clawing at his insides Hot blood seemed to flood his brain so that all thought was extinguished replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly .Wrestling with this sudden madness he heard Rons voice as though from a great distance away .Oi !Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around .What ?said Ginny .I dont want to find my own sister snogging people in public !This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in !said Ginny .Dean was looking embarrassed .He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Deans instant dismissal from the team .Er .cmon Ginny said Dean lets go back to the common room .You go !said Ginny .I want a word with my dear brother !Dean left looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene .Right said Ginny tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron lets get this straight once and for all .It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them Ron Yeah it is !said Ron just as angrily .Dyou think I want people saying my sisters a A what ?shouted Ginny drawing her wand .A what exactly ?He doesnt mean anything Ginny said Harry automatically though the monster was roaring its approval of Rons words .Oh yes he does !she said flaring up at Harry .Just because hes never snogged anyone in his life just because the best kiss hes ever had is from our Auntie Muriel Shut your mouth !bellowed Ron bypassing red and turning maroon .No I will not !yelled Ginny beside herself .Ive seen you with Phlegm hoping shell kiss you on the cheek every time you see her its pathetic !If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you wouldnt mind so much that everyone else does it !Ron had pulled out his wand too Harry stepped swiftly between them .You dont know what youre talking about !Ron roared trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched .Just because I dont do it in public !Ginny screamed with derisive laughter trying to push Harry out of the way .Been kissing Pigwidgeon have you ?Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow ?You A streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches Harry pushed Ron up against the wall .Dont be stupid Harrys snogged Cho Chang !shouted Ginny who sounded close to tears now .And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum its only you who acts like its something disgusting Ron and thats because youve got about as much experience as a twelveyearold !And with that she stormed away .Harry quickly let go of Ron the look on his face was murderous .They both stood there breathing heavily until Mrs Norris Filch s cat appeared around the corner which broke the tension .Cmon said Harry as the sound of Filch s shuffling feet reached their ears .They hurried up the stairs and along a seventhfloor corridor .Oi out of the way !Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn .Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass he felt disoriented dizzy being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this .Its just because shes Rons sister he told himself .You just didnt like seeing her kissing Dean because shes Rons sister .But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead .The monster in his chest purred .but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry shouting things like betrayal of trust .supposed to be my friend .Dyou think Hermione did snog Krum ?Ron asked abruptly as they approached the Fat Lady .Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded in which he and Ginny were quite alone What ?he said confusedly .Oh .er .The honest answer was yes but he did not want to give it .However Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harrys face .Dilligrout he said darkly to the Fat Lady and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room .Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again indeed they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence each absorbed in his own thoughts .Harry lay awake for a long time looking up at the canopy of his fourposter and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder brotherly .They had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing Quidditch teasing Ron and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm ?He had known Ginny for years now .It was natural that he should feel protective .natural that he should want to look out for her .want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her .No .he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling .Ron gave a great grunting snore .Shes Rons sister Harry told himself firmly .Rons sister .Shes outofbounds .He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything .He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny .Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beaters bat but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one who was not only coldshouldering Ginny and Dean but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy sneering indifference .What was more Ron seemed to have become overnight as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast Ended Skrewt .Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success finally Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon and Ron stalked off to the boys dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him .To Harrys dismay Rons new aggression did not wear off over the next few days .Worse still it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills which made him still more aggressive so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears .You shut up and leave her alone !shouted Peakes who was about twothirds Rons height though admittedly carrying a heavy bat .ENOUGH !bellowed Harry who had seen Ginny glowering in Rons direction and remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat Bogey Hex soared over to intervene before things got out of hand .Peakes go and pack up the Bludgers .Demelza pull yourself together you played really well today .Ron .he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it youre my best mate but carry on treating the rest of them like this and Im going to kick you off the team .He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him but then something much worse happened Ron seemed to sag on his broom all the fight went out of him and he said I resign .Im pathetic .Youre not pathetic and youre not resigning !said Harry fiercely seizing Ron by the front of his robes .You can save anything when youre on form its a mental problem youve got !You calling me mental ?Yeah maybe I am !They glared at each other for a moment then Ron shook his head wearily .I know you havent got any time to find another Keeper so Ill play tomorrow but if we lose and we will Im taking myself off the team .Nothing Harry said made any difference .He tried boosting Rons confidence all through dinner but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice .Harry persisted in the common room that evening but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks .Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant and hopefully goalsaving attitude but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever .Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness .He did not want to lose the upcoming match not only was it his first as Captain but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him .Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices their chances of winning were very slim .If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together .make him play at the top of his form .something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day .And the answer came to Harry in one sudden glorious stroke of inspiration .Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall .Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear pale blue sky a good omen .The Gryffindor table a solid mass of red and gold cheered as Harry and Ron approached .Harry grinned and waved Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head .Cheer up Ron !called Lavender .I know youll be brilliant !Ron ignored her .Tea ?Harry asked him .Coffee ?Pumpkin juice ?Anything said Ron glumly taking a moody bite of toast .A few minutes later Hermione who had become so tired of Rons recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table .How are you both feeling ?she asked tentatively her eyes on the back of Rons head .Fine said Harry who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice .There you go Ron .Drink up .Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke sharply .Dont drink that Ron !Both Harry and Ron looked up at her .Why not ?said Ron .Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes .You just put something in that drink .Excuse me ?said Harry .You heard me .I saw you .You just tipped something into Rons drink .Youve got the bottle in your hand right now !I dont know what youre talking about said Harry stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket .Ron I warn you dont drink it !Hermione said again alarmed but Ron picked up the glass drained it in one gulp and said Stop bossing me around Hermione .She looked scandalized .Bending low so that only Harry could hear her she hissed You should be expelled for that .Id never have believed it of you Harry !Hark whos talking he whispered back .Confunded anyone lately ?She stormed up the table away from them .Harry watched her go without regret .Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was .He then looked around at Ron who was smacking his lips .Nearly time said Harry blithely .The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium .Pretty lucky the weathers this good eh ?Harry asked Ron .Yeah said Ron who was pale and sicklooking .Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room .Conditions look ideal said Ginny ignoring Ron .And guess what ?That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and hes too sore to play !And even better than that Malfoys gone off sick too !What ?said Harry wheeling around to stare at her .Hes ill ?Whats wrong with him ?No idea but its great for us said Ginny brightly .Theyre playing Harper instead hes in my year and hes an idiot .Harry smiled back vaguely but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch .Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better .Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on ?Was he really ill or was he faking ?Fishy isnt it ?he said in an undertone to Ron .Malfoy not playing ?Lucky I call it said Ron looking slightly more animated .And Vaisey off too hes their best goal scorer I didnt fancy hey !he said suddenly freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry .What ?I .you .Ron had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited .My drink .my pumpkin juice .you didnt . ?Harry raised his eyebrows but said nothing except Well be starting in about five minutes youd better get your boots on .They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos .One end of the stadium was solid red and gold the other a sea of green and silver .Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegoods famous liontopped hat .Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch the referee who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate .Captains shake hands she said and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain Urquhart .Mount your brooms .On the whistle .three .two .one .The whistle sounded Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away .Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper who was zigzagging far below him .Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentators started up .Well there they go and I think were all surprised to see the team that Potters put together this year .Many thought given Ronald Weasleys patchy performance as Keeper last year that he might be off the team but of course a close personal friendship with the Captain does help .These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch .Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentators podium .A tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordans Harry recognized Zacharias Smith a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked .Oh and here comes Slytherin s first attempt on goal its Urquhart streaking down the pitch and Harrys stomach turned over .Weasley saves it well hes bound to get lucky sometimes I suppose .Thats right Smith he is muttered Harry grinning to himself as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch .With half an hour of the game gone Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero Ron having made some truly spectacular saves some by the very tips of his gloves and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindors six goals .This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them and he started on Peakes and Coote instead .Of course Coote isnt really the usual build for a Beater said Zacharias loftily theyve generally got a bit more muscle Hit a Bludger at him !Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past but Coote grinning broadly chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction .Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark .It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong .Again and again they scored and again and again at the other end of the pitch Ron saved goals with apparent ease .He was actually smiling now and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite Weasley Is Our King he pretended to conduct them from on high .Thinks hes something special today doesnt he ?said a snide voice and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately .Your bloodtraitor pal .Madam Hoochs back was turned and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger by the time she looked around Harper had already sped off .His shoulder aching Harry raced after him determined to ram him back .And I think Harper of Slytherins seen the Snitch !said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone .Yes hes certainly seen something Potter hasnt !Smith really was an idiot thought Harry hadnt he noticed them collide ?But next moment his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky Smith was right and Harry was wrong Harper had not sped upward at random he had spotted what Harry had not The Snitch was speeding along high above them glinting brightly against the clear blue sky .Harry accelerated the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smiths commentary or the crowd but Harper was still ahead of him and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost .and now Harper was feet from it his hand outstretched .Oi Harper !yelled Harry in desperation .How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him ?He did not know what made him say it but Harper did a doubletake he fumbled the Snitch let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it .Harry made a great swipe for the tiny fluttering ball and caught it .YES !Harry yelled .Wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the Snitch held high in his hand .As the crowd realized what had happened a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game .Ginny where re you going ?yelled Harry who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team but Ginny sped right on past them until with an almighty crash she collided with the commentators podium .As the crowd shrieked and laughed the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall Forgot to brake Professor sorry .Laughing Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny but let go very quickly .Avoiding her gaze he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead as all enmity forgotten the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm punching the air and waving to their supporters .The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant .Party up in the common room Seamus said !yelled Dean exuberantly .Cmon Ginny Demelza !Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room .They were just about to leave when Hermione entered .She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined .I want a word with you Harry .She took a deep breath .You shouldnt have done it .You heard Slughorn its illegal .What are you going to do turn us in ?demanded Ron .What are you two talking about ?asked Harry turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning .You know perfectly well what were talking about !said Hermione shrilly .You spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast !Felix Felicis !No I didnt said Harry turning back to face them both .Yes you did Harry and thats why everything went right there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything !I didnt put it in !said Harry grinning broadly .He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning .It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax .I wanted Ron to think Id done it so I faked it when I knew you were looking .He looked at Ron .You saved everything because you felt lucky .You did it all yourself .He pocketed the potion again .There really wasnt anything in my pumpkin juice ?Ron said astounded .But the weathers good .and Vaisey couldnt play .I honestly havent been given lucky potion ?Harry shook his head .Ron gaped at him for a moment then rounded on Hermione imitating her voice .You added Felix Felicis to Rons juice this morning thats why he saved every thing See !I can save goals without help Hermione !I never said you couldnt Ron you thought youd been given it too !But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder .Er said Harry into the sudden silence he had not expected his plan to backfire like this shall .shall we go up to the party then ?You go !said Hermione blinking back tears .Im sick of Ron at the moment I dont know what Im supposed to have done .And she stormed out of the changing room too .Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd many of whom shouted congratulations at him but he felt a great sense of letdown he had been sure that if Ron won the match he and Hermione would be friends again immediately .He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum not when the offense had occurred so long ago .Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party which was in full swing when he arrived .Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him .What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers who wanted a blowbyblow match analysis and the large group of girls that encircled him laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids it was some time before he could try and find Ron .At last he extricated himself from Romilda Vane who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorns Christmas party with him .As he was ducking toward the drinks table he walked straight into Ginny Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels .Looking for Ron ?she asked smirking .Hes over there the filthy hypocrite .Harry looked into the corner she was indicating .There in full view of the whole room stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose .It looks like hes eating her face doesnt it ?said Ginny dispassionately .But I suppose hes got to refine his technique somehow .Good game Harry .She patted him on the arm Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer .Crookshanks trotted after her his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold .Harry turned away from Ron who did not look like he would be surfacing soon just as the portrait hole was closing .With a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight .He darted forward sidestepped Romilda Vane again and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady .The corridor outside seemed to be deserted .Hermione ?He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried .She was sitting on the teachers desk alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head which she had clearly just conjured out of midair .Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this .Oh hello Harry she said in a brittle voice .I was just practicing .Yeah .theyre er really good .said Harry .He had no idea what to say to her .He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy when she said in an unnaturally highpitched voice Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations .Er .does he ?said Harry .Dont pretend you didnt see him said Hermione .He wasnt exactly hiding it was ?The door behind them burst open .To Harrys horror Ron came in laughing pulling Lavender by the hand .Oh he said drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione .Oops !said Lavender and she backed out of the room giggling .The door swung shut behind her .There was a horrible swelling billowing silence .Hermione was staring at Ron who refused to look at her but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness Hi Harry !Wondered where youd got to !Hermione slid off the desk .The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange feathery model of the solar system .You shouldnt leave Lavender waiting outside she said quietly .Shell wonder where youve gone .She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door .Harry glanced at Ron who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened .Oppugno came a shriek from the doorway .Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron her expression wild The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach .Gerremoffme !he yelled but with one last look of vindictive fury Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it .Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed .THE UNBREAKABLE VOW Snow was swirling against the icy windows once more Christmas was approaching fast .Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors .Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past which caused blockages in the corridors fortunately however Harrys frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castles secret passageways so that he was able without too much difficulty to navigate mistletoefree routes between classes .Ron who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity simply roared with laughter about it all .Although Harry much preferred this new laughing joking Ron to the moody aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks the improved Ron came at a heavy price .Firstly Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted and secondly Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again .Ron whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermiones bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone .She cant complain he told Harry .She snogged Krum .So shes found out someone wants to snog me too .Well its a free country .I havent done anything wrong .Harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning Quintessence A Quest .Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight .I never promised Hermione anything Ron mumbled .I mean all right I was going to go to Slughorns Christmas party with her but she never said .just as friends .Im a free agent .Harry turned a page of Quintessence aware that Ron was watching him .Rons voice tailed away in mutters barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire though Harry thought he caught the words Krum and cant complain again .Hermiones schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings when Ron was in any case so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing .Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there so Harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversations were held in whispers .Hes at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes said Hermione while the librarian Madam Pince prowled the shelves behind them .I really couldnt care less .She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment .Harry said nothing .He thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use .He bent a little lower over Advanced PotionMaking and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the Princes useful additions to Libatius Borages text .And incidentally said Hermione after a few moments you need to be careful .For the last time said Harry speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after threequarters of an hour of silence I am not giving back this book Ive learned more from the HalfBlood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in Im not talking about your stupid socalled Prince said Hermione giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her .Im talking about earlier .I went into the girls bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that Romilda Vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion .Theyre all hoping theyre going to get you to take them to Slughorn s party and they all seem to have bought Fred and Georges love potions which Im afraid to say probably work Why didnt you confiscate them then ?demanded Harry .It seemed extraordinary that Hermiones mania for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture .They didnt have the potions with them in the bathroom said Hermione scornfully .They were just discussing tactics .As I doubt whether even the Half Blood Prince she gave the book another nasty look could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once Id just invite someone to go with you thatll stop all the others thinking theyve still got a chance .Its tomorrow night theyre getting desperate .There isnt anyone I want to invite mumbled Harry who was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency .Well just be careful what you drink because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business said Hermione grimly .She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill .Harry watched her with his mind a long way away .Hang on a moment he said slowly .I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes ?And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned ?asked Hermione still concentrating on her essay .But I thought all the owls were being searched .So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school ?Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions said Hermione .Its part of their Owl Order Service .You know a lot about it .Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced PotionMaking .It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer she said coldly .I dont go around putting potions in peoples drinks .or pretending to either which is just as bad .Yeah well never mind that said Harry quickly .The point is Filch is being fooled isnt he ?These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else !So why couldnt Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school ?Oh Harry .not that again .Come on why not ?demanded Harry .Look sighed Hermione Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms dont they ?Theyre used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects .Theyd have picked up a powerful curse like the one on that necklace within seconds .But something thats just been put in the wrong bottle wouldnt register and anyway love potions arent Dark or dangerous Easy for you to say muttered Harry thinking of Romilda Vane .so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasnt a cough potion and hes not a very good wizard I doubt he can tell one potion from Hermione stopped dead Harry had heard it too .Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves .They waited and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheeks her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying .The library is now closed she said .Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct what have you been doing to that book you depraved boy ?It isnt the librarys its mine !said Harry hastily snatching his copy of Advanced PotionMaking off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand .Despoiled !she hissed .Desecrated !Befouled !Its just a book thats been written on !said Harry tugging it out of her grip .She looked as though she might have a seizure Hermione who had hastily packed her things grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away .Shell ban you from the library if youre not careful .Why did you have to bring that stupid book ?Its not my fault shes barking mad Hermione .Or dyou think she overheard you being rude about Filch ?Ive always thought there might be something going on between them .Oh ha ha .Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again they made their way along the deserted lamp lit corridors back to the common room arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other .Baubles said Harry to the Fat Lady this being the new festive password .Same to you said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them .Hi Harry !said Romilda Vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole .Fancy a gillywater ?Hermione gave him a whatdidItellyou ?look over her shoulder .No thanks said Harry quickly .I dont like it much .Well take these anyway said Romilda thrusting a box into his hands .Chocolate Cauldrons theyve got firewhisky in them .My gran sent them to me but I dont like them .Oh right thanks a lot said Harry who could not think what else to say .Er Im just going over here with .He hurried off behind Hermione his voice tailing away feebly .Told you said Hermione succinctly .Sooner you ask someone sooner theyll all leave you alone and you can But her face suddenly turned blank she had just spotted Ron and Lavender who were entwined in the same armchair .Well good night Harry said Hermione though it was only seven oclock in the evening and she left for the girls dormitory without another word .Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through plus Slughorns party after which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow .It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to calm down think better of their behavior .But his hopes were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day .They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration working in front of mirrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows .Hermione laughed unkindly at Rons disastrous first attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again .She raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind Harry deciding that her need was greater than Rons just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her .He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls bathroom on the floor below .She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood who was patting her vaguely on the back .Oh hello Harry said Luna .Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow ?Hi Luna .Hermione you left your stuff .He held out her books .Oh yes said Hermione in a choked voice taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case .Thank you Harry .Well Id better get going .And she hurried off without giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any .Shes a bit upset said Luna .I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there but it turned out to be Hermione .She said something about that Ron Weasley .Yeah theyve had a row said Harry .He says very funny things sometimes doesnt he ?said Luna as they set off down the corridor together .But he can be a bit unkind .I noticed that last year .I spose said Harry .Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her .So have you had a good term ?Oh its been all right said Luna .A bit lonely without the D .A .Ginnys been nice though .She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony the other day How would you like to come to Slughorns party with me tonight ?The words were out of Harrys mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking .Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise .Slughorns party ?With you ?Yeah said Harry .Were supposed to bring guests so I thought you might like .I mean .He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear .I mean just as friends you know .But if you dont want to .He was already half hoping that she didnt want to .Oh no Id love to go with you as friends !said Luna beaming as he had never seen her beam before .Nobodys ever asked me to a party before as a friend !Is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party ?Should I do mine too ?No said Harry firmly that was a mistake .Ill get Hermione to put it right for me .So Ill meet you in the entrance hall at eight oclock then .AHA !screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of them they had just passed right underneath Peeves who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them .Potty asked Loony to go to the partyl Potty lurves Loony !Potty luuuuurves LooooooonyV And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking Potty loves Loony !Nice to keep these things private said Harry .And sure enough in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorns party .You couldve taken anyonel said Ron in disbelief over dinner .Anyonel And you chose Loony Lovegood ?Dont call her that Ron snapped Ginny pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends .Im really glad youre taking her Harry shes so excited .And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean .Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it .A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone playing with her stew .Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively .You could say sorry suggested Harry bluntly .What and get attacked by another flock of canaries ?muttered Ron .What did you have to imitate her for ?She laughed at my mustache !So did I it was the stupidest thing Ive ever seen .But Ron did not seem to have heard Lavender had just arrived with Parvati .Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron Lavender flung her arms around Rons neck .Hi Harry said Parvati who like him looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends .Hi said Harry .Howre you ?Youre staying at Hogwarts then ?I heard your parents wanted you to leave .I managed to talk them out of it for the time being said Parvati .That Katie thing really freaked them out but as there hasnt been anything since .Oh hi Hermione !Parvati positively beamed .Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration .He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back if possible even more brightly .Girls were very strange sometimes .Hi Parvati !said Hermione ignoring Ron and Lavender completely .Are you going to Slughorns party tonight ?No invite said Parvati gloomily .Id love to go though it sounds like its going to be really good .Youre going arent you ?Yes Im meeting Cormac at eight and were There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced .Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything .were going up to the party together .Cormac ?said Parvati .Cormac McLaggen you mean ?Thats right said Hermione sweetly .The one who almost she put a great deal of emphasis on the word became Gryffindor Keeper .Are you going out with him then ?asked Parvati wideeyed .Oh yes didnt you know ?said Hermione with a most unHermioneish giggle .No !said Parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip .Wow you like your Quidditch players dont you ?First Krum then McLaggen .I like really good Quidditch players Hermione corrected her still smiling .Well see you .Got to go and get ready for the party .She left .At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen and all they had ever guessed about Hermione .Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing .Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge .When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight oclock that night he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna .She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice .Harry was glad in any case that she had left off her radish earrings her butterbeer cork necklace and her Spectrespecs .Hi he said .Shall we get going then ?Oh yes she said happily .Where is the party ?Slughorns office said Harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering .Did you hear theres supposed to be a vampire coming ?Rufus Scrimgeour ?asked Luna .I what ?said Harry disconcerted .You mean the Minister of Magic ?Yes hes a vampire said Luna matteroffactly .Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry .Obviously they didnt want the truth to get out !Harry who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to Luna repeating her fathers bizarre views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching Slughorns office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took .Whether it had been built that way or because he had used magical trickery to make it so Slughorns office was much larger than the usual teachers study .The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hangings so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent .The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light .Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation and a number of houseelves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing so that they looked like little roving tables .Harry mboy !boomed Slughorn almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door .Come in come in so many people Id like you to meet !Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket .Gripping Harrys arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him Slughorn led him purposefully into the party Harry seized Lunas hand and dragged her along with him .Harry Id like you to meet Eldred Worple an old student of mine author of Blood Brothers My Life Amongst the Vampires and of course his friend Sanguini .Worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed Harrys hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire Sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded .He looked rather bored .A gaggle of girls was standing close to him looking curious and excited .Harry Potter I am simply delighted !said Worple peering shortsightedly up into Harrys face .I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting ?Er said Harry were you ?Just as modest as Horace described !said Worple .But seriously his manner changed it became suddenly businesslike I would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you dear boy craving !If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews say in four or fivehour sessions why we could have the book finished within months .And all with very little effort on your part I assure you ask Sanguini here if it isnt quite Sanguini stay here added Worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye .Here have a pasty said Worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguinis hand before turning his attention back to Harry .My dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea Im definitely not interested said Harry firmly and Ive just seen a friend of mine sorry .He pulled Luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters .Hermione !HermioneV Harry !There you are thank goodness !Hi Luna !Whats happened to you ?asked Harry for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devils Snare .Oh Ive just escaped I mean Ive just left Cormac she said .Under the mistletoe she added in explanation as Harry continued to look questioningly at her .Serves you right for coming with him he told her severely .I thought hed annoy Ron most said Hermione dispassionately .I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith but I thought on the whole You considered Smith ?said Harry revolted .Yes I did and Im starting to wish Id chosen him McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman .Lets go this way well be able to see him coming hes so tall .The three of them made their way over to the other side of the room scooping up goblets of mead on the way realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone .Hello said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney .Good evening my dear said Professor Trelawney focusing upon Luna with some difficulty .Harry could smell cooking sherry again .I havent seen you in my classes lately .No Ive got Firenze this year said Luna .Oh of course said Professor Trelawney with an angry drunken titter .Or Dobbin as I prefer to think of him .You would have thought would you not that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse ?But no .we share classes .Its an insult frankly an insult .Do you know .Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry .Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze Harry drew closer to Hermione and said Lets get something straight .Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts ?Hermione raised her eyebrows .Do you really think Id stoop that low ?Harry looked at her shrewdly .Hermione if you can ask out McLaggen Theres a difference said Hermione with dignity .Ive got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might or might not have happened at Keeper tryouts .Good said Harry fervently .Because hell just fall apart again and well lose the next match Quidditch !said Hermione angrily .Is that all boys care about ?Cormac hasnt asked me one single question about myself no Ive just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen nonstop ever since oh no here he comes !She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished .Seen Hermione ?asked McLaggen forcing his way through the throng a minute later .No sorry said Harry and he turned quickly to join in Lunas conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking .Harry Potter !said Professor Trelawney in deep vibrant tones noticing him for the first time .Oh hello said Harry unenthusiastically .My dear boy !she said in a very carrying whisper .The rumors !The stories !The Chosen One !Of course I have known for a very long time .The omens were never good Harry .But why have you not returned to Divination ?For you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance !Ah Sybill we all think our subjects most important !said a loud voice and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawneys other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other .But I dont think Ive ever known such a natural at Potions !said Slughorn regarding Harry with a fond if bloodshot eye .Instinctive you know like his mother !Ive only ever taught a few with this kind of ability I can tell you that Sybill why even Severus And to Harrys horror Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them .Stop skulking and come and join us Severus !hiccuped Slughorn happily .I was just talking about Harrys exceptional potionmaking !Some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five years !Trapped with Slughorns arm around his shoulders Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry his black eyes narrowed .Funny I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all .Well then its natural ability !shouted Slughorn .You should have seen what he gave me first lesson Draught of Living Death never had a student produce finer on a first attempt I dont think even you Severus Really ?said Snape quietly his eyes still boring into Harry who felt a certain disquiet .The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions .Remind me what other subjects youre taking Harry ?asked Slughorn .Defense Against the Dark Arts Charms Transfiguration Herbology .All the subjects required in short for an Auror said Snape with the faintest sneer .Yeah well thats what Id like to do said Harry defiantly .And a great one youll make too !boomed Slughorn .I dont think you should be an Auror Harry said Luna unexpectedly .Everybody looked at her .The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy I thought everyone knew that .Theyre working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease .Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh .Really it had been worth bringing Luna just for this .Emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch .Professor Slughorn wheezed Filch his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischiefdetection in his bulging eyes I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor .He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out .Did you issue him with an invitation ?Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch s grip looking furious .All right I wasnt invited !he said angrily .I was trying to gatecrash happy ?No Im not !said Filch a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face .Youre in trouble you are !Didnt the headmaster say that nighttime prowlings out unless youve got permission didnt he eh ?Thats all right Argus thats all right said Slughorn waving a hand .Its Christmas and its not a crime to want to come to a party .Just this once well forget any punishment you may stay Draco .Filch s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable but why Harry wondered watching him did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy ?And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and .was it possible ? .a little afraid ?But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen Filch had turned and shuffled away muttering under his breath Malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity and Snapes face was smoothly inscrutable again .Its nothing nothing said Slughorn waving away Malfoy s thanks .I did know your grandfather after all .He always spoke very highly of you sir said Malfoy quickly .Said you were the best potionmaker hed ever known .Harry stared at Malfoy .It was not the suckingup that intrigued him he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time .It was the fact that Malfoy did after all look a little ill .This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin .Id like a word with you Draco said Snape suddenly .Oh now Severus said Slughorn hiccuping again its Christmas dont be too hard Im his Head of House and I shall decide how hard or otherwise to be said Snape curtly .Follow me Draco .They left Snape leading the way Malfoy looking resentful .Harry stood there for a moment irresolute then said Ill be back in a bit Luna er bathroom .All right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney who seemed sincerely interested .It was easy once out of the party to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself for the corridor was quite deserted .What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy .Harry ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn s office behind him .Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons .or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room .Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices . .cannot afford mistakes Draco because if you are expelled I didnt have anything to do with it all right ?I hope you are telling the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish .Already you are suspected of having a hand in it .Who suspects me ?said Malfoy angrily .For the last time I didnt do it okay ?That Bell girl mustve had an enemy no one knows about dont look at me like that !I know what youre doing Im not stupid but it wont work I can stop you !There was a pause and then Snape said quietly Ah .Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency I see .What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master Draco ?Im not trying to conceal anything from him I just dont want you butting in !Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole .What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this Snape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking ?So that is why you have been avoiding me this term ?You have feared my interference ?You realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there Draco So put me in detention !Report me to Dumbledore !jeered Malfoy .There was another pause .Then Snape said You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things .Youd better stop telling me to come to your office then !Listen to me said Snape his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear .I am trying to help you .I swore to your mother I would protect you .I made the Unbreakable Vow Draco Looks like you 11 have to break it then because I dont need your protection !Its my job he gave it to me and Im doing it Ive got a plan and its going to work its just taking a bit longer than I thought it would !What is your plan ?Its none of your business !If you tell me what you are trying to do I can assist you Ive got all the assistance I need thanks Im not alone !You were certainly alone tonight which was foolish in the extreme wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup these are elementary mistakes I wouldve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadnt put them in detention !Keep your voice down !spat Snape for Malfoys voice had risen excitedly .If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts O .W .L .this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres What does it matter ?said Malfoy .Defense Against the Dark Arts its all just a joke isnt it an act ?Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts It is an act that is crucial to success Draco !said Snape .Where do you think I would have been all these years if I had not known how to act ?Now listen to me !You are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle Theyre not the only ones Ive got other people on my side better people !Then why not confide in me and I can I know what youre up to !You want to steal my glory !There was another pause then Snape said coldly You are speaking like a child .I quite understand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you but Harry had barely a seconds warning he heard Malfoys footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open Malfoy was striding away down the corridor past the open door of Slughorns office around the distant corner and out of sight .Hardly daring to breathe Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom .His expression unfathomable he returned to the party .Harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing .A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS So Snape was offering to help him ?He was definitely offering to help him ?If you ask that once more said Harry Im going to stick this sprout Im only checking !said Ron .They were standing alone at the Burrows kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs Weasley .Snow was drifting past the window in front of them .Yes Snape was offering to help himl said Harry .He said hed promised Malfoys mother to protect him that hed made an Unbreakable Oath or something An Unbreakable Vow ?said Ron looking stunned .Nah he cant have .Are you sure ?Yes Im sure said Harry .Why what does it mean ?Well you cant break an Unbreakable Vow .Id worked that much out for myself funnily enough .What happens if you break it then ?You die said Ron simply .Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five .I nearly did too I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us .He went mental said Ron with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes .Only time Ive ever seen Dad as angry as Mum .Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since .Yeah well passing over Freds left buttock I beg your pardon ?said Freds voice as the twins entered the kitchen .aah George look at this .Theyre using knives and everything .Bless them .Ill be seventeen in two and a bit months time said Ron grumpily and then Ill be able to do it by magic !But meanwhile said George sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a whoopsadaisy !You made me do that !said Ron angrily sucking his cut thumb .You wait when Im seventeen Im sure youll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills yawned Fred .And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills Ronald said George what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called unless our information is faulty Lavender Brown ?Ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts .Mind your own business .What a snappy retort said Fred .I really dont know how you think of them .No what we wanted to know was .how did it happen ?What dyou mean ?Did she have an accident or something ?What ?Well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage ?Careful now !Mrs Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand .Ronl she said furiously .Dont you ever let me see you throwing knives again !I wont said Ron let you see he added under his breath as he turned back to the sprout mountain .Fred George Im sorry dears but Remus is arriving tonight so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two .No problem said George .Then as Charlie isnt coming home that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic and if Fleur shares with Ginny thatll make Ginnys Christmas muttered Fred .everyone should be comfortable .Well theyll have a bed anyway said Mrs Weasley sounding slightly harassed .Percy definitely not showing his ugly face then ?asked Fred .Mrs Weasley turned away before she answered .No hes busy I expect at the Ministry .Or hes the worlds biggest prat said Fred as Mrs Weasley left the kitchen .One of the two .Well lets get going then George .What are you two up to ?asked Ron .Cant you help us with these sprouts ?You could just use your wand and then well be free too !No I dont think we can do that said Fred seriously .Its very characterbuilding stuff learning to peel sprouts without magic makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs and if you want people to help you Ron added George throwing the paper airplane at him I wouldnt chuck knives at them .Just a little hint .Were off to the village theres a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous .almost like real magic .Gits said Ron darkly watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard .Wouldve only taken them ten seconds and then we couldve gone too .I couldnt said Harry .I promised Dumbledore I wouldnt wander off while Im staying here .Oh yeah said Ron .He peeled a few more sprouts and then said Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other ?Yep said Harry .Im going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and Dumbledores top of the list .I might have another word with your dad too .Pity you didnt hear what Malfoys actually doing though .I couldnt have done could I ?That was the whole point he was refusing to tell Snape .There was silence for a moment or two then Ron said Course you know what theyll all say ?Dad and Dumbledore and all of them ?Theyll say Snape isnt really trying to help Malfoy he was just trying to find out what Malfoys up to .They didnt hear him said Harry flatly .No ones that good an actor not even Snape .Yeah .Im just saying though said Ron .Harry turned to face him frowning .You think Im right though ?Yeah I do !said Ron hastily .Seriously I do !But theyre all convinced Snapes in the Order arent they ?Harry said nothing .It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear Hermione now Obviously Harry he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what hes doing .This was pure imagination however as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard .She had disappeared from Slughorns parry before he returned to it or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room .As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays .He was not entirely sure that she had heard him though Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal goodbye just behind him at the time .Still even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing Malfoy was definitely up to something and Snape knew it so Harry felt fully justified in saying I told you so which he had done several times to Ron already .Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr Weasley who was working very long hours at the Ministry until Christmas Eve night .The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paperchain explosion .Fred George Harry and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner .Stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet .They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs Weasleys favorite singer Celestina Warbeck whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set .Fleur who seemed to find Celestina very dull was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that Celestina grew louder and louder .Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny .Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks as though hoping to pick up tips .Meanwhile Remus Lupin who was thinner and more ragged looking than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice .Oh come and stir my cauldron And if you do it right Ill boil you up some hot strong love To keep you warm tonight .We danced to this when we were eighteen !said Mrs Weasley wiping her eyes on her knitting .Do you remember Arthur ?Mphf ?said Mr Weasley whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling .Oh yes .marvelous tune .With an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry who was sitting next to him .Sorry about this he said jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus .Be over soon .No problem said Harry grinning .Has it been busy at the Ministry ?Very said Mr Weasley .I wouldnt mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrests weve made in the last couple of months I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater only dont repeat that Harry he added quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden .Theyre not still holding Stan Shunpike are they ?asked Harry .Im afraid so said Mr Weasley .I know Dumbledores tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan .I mean anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that hes about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma .but the top levels want to look as though theyre making some progress and ‘three arrests sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases .but again this is all top secret .I wont say anything said Harry .He hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say as he marshaled his thoughts Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me .Mr Weasley you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school ?I checked Harry said Mr Weasley at once .I went and searched the Malfoys house .There was nothing either broken or whole that shouldnt have been there .Yeah I know I saw in the Prophet that youd looked .but this is something different .Well something more .And he told Mr Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape .As Harry spoke he saw Lupins head turn a little toward him taking in every word .When he had finished there was silence except for Celestinas crooning .Oh my poor heart where has it gone ?Its left me for a spell .Has it occurred to you Harry said Mr Weasley that Snape was simply pretending ?Pretending to offer help so that he could find out what Malfoys up to ?said Harry quickly .Yeah I thought youd say that .But how do we know ?It isnt our business to know said Lupin unexpectedly .He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr Weasley .Its Dumbledores business .Dumbledore trusts Severus and that ought to be good enough for all of us .But said Harry just say just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape People have said it many times .It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledores judgment .I do therefore I trust Severus .But Dumbledore can make mistakes argued Harry .He says it himself .And you he looked Lupin straight in the eye do you honestly like Snape ?I neither like nor dislike Severus said Lupin .No Harry I am speaking the truth he added as Harry pulled a skeptical expression .We shall never be bosom friends perhaps after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus there is too much bitterness there .But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month made it perfectly so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon .But he ‘accidentally let it slip that youre a werewolf so you had to leave !said Harry angrily .Lupin shrugged .The news would have leaked out anyway .We both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion .He kept me healthy .I must be grateful .Maybe he didnt dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him !said Harry .You are determined to hate him Harry said Lupin with a faint smile .And I understand with James as your father with Sirius as your godfather you have inherited an old prejudice .By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him .It might have been on Dumbledores orders that Severus questioned Draco . .and now youve torn it quite apart Ill thank you to give back my heart !Celestina ended her song on a very long highpitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which Mrs Weasley joined in with enthusiastically .Eez eet over ?said Fleur loudly .Thank goodness what an orrible Shall we have a nightcap then ?asked Mr Weasley loudly leaping to his feet .Who wants eggnog ?What have you been up to lately ?Harry asked Lupin as Mr Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation .Oh Ive been underground said Lupin .Almost literally .Thats why I havent been able to write Harry sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway .What do you mean ?Ive been living among my fellows my equals said Lupin .Werewolves he added at Harrys look of incomprehension .Nearly all of them are on Voldemorts side .Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was .readymade .He sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on I am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than I ?However it has been difficult gaining their trust .I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins stealing and sometimes killing to eat .How come they like Voldemort ?They think that under his rule they will have a better life said Lupin .And it is hard to argue with Grey back out there .Whos Grey back ?You havent heard of him ?Lupins hands closed convulsively in his lap .Fenrir Greyback is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today .He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards .Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services .Greyback specializes in children .Bite them young he says and raise them away from their parents raise them to hate normal wizards .Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon peoples sons and daughters it is a threat that usually produces good results .Lupin paused and then said It was Greyback who bit me .What ?said Harry astonished .When when you were a kid you mean ?Yes .My father had offended him .I did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me I even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform .But Greyback is not like that .At the full moon he positions himself close to victims ensuring that he is near enough to strike .He plans it all .And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves .I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greybacks insistence that we werewolves deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people .But you are normal !said Harry fiercely .Youve just got a a problem Lupin burst out laughing .Sometimes you remind me a lot of James .He called it my ‘furry little problem in company .Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit .He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr Weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more cheerful .Harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin .Have you ever heard of someone called the Half Blood Prince ?The HalfBlood what ?Prince said Harry watching him closely for signs of recognition .There are no Wizarding princes said Lupin now smiling .Is this a title youre thinking of adopting ?I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One would be enough .Its nothing to do with me !said Harry indignantly .The HalfBlood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts Ive got his old Potions book .He wrote spells all over it spells he invented .One of them was Levicorpus Oh that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts said Lupin reminiscently .There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldnt move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle .My dad used it said Harry .I saw him in the Pensieve he used it on Snape .He tried to sound casual as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect Lupins smile was a little too understanding .Yes he said but he wasnt the only one .As I say it was very popular .You know how these spells come and go .But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school Harry persisted .Not necessarily said Lupin .Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else .He looked into Harrys face and then said quietly James was a pureblood Harry and I promise you he never asked us to call him ‘Prince .Abandoning pretense Harry said And it wasnt Sirius ?Or you ?Definitely not .Oh .Harry stared into the fire .I just thought well hes helped me out a lot in Potions classes the Prince has .How old is this book Harry ?I dunno Ive never checked .Well perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts said Lupin .Shortly after this Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love which was taken by everyone once they had glimpsed Mrs Weasleys expression to be the cue to go to bed .Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Rons attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for Harry .Ron fell asleep almost immediately but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced PotionMaking before getting into bed .There he turned its pages searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published .It was nearly fifty years old .Neither his father nor his fathers friends had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago .Feeling disappointed Harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and Snape Stan Shunpike and the HalfBlood Prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children .Shes got to be joking .Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed .He put on his glasses and looked around the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain .Whats that ?asked Harry .Its from Lavender said Ron sounding revolted .She cant honestly think Id wear .Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter .Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words My Sweetheart Nice he said .Classy .You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George .If you tell them said Ron shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow I I 111 Stutter at me ?said Harry grinning .Come on would I ?How could she think Id like something like that though ?Ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked .Well think back said Harry .Have you ever let it slip that youd like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart round your neck ?Well .we dont really talk much said Ron .Its mainly .Snogging said Harry .Well yeah said Ron .He hesitated a moment then said Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen ?I dunno said Harry .They were at Slughorns party together but I dont think it went that well .Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking .Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front handknitted by Mrs Weasley a large box of Weasleys Wizard Wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp moldysmelling package that came with a label reading TO MASTER FROM KREACHER .Harry stared at it .Dyou reckon this is safe to open ?he asked .Cant be anything dangerous all our mails still being searched at the Ministry replied Ron though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously .I didnt think of giving Kreacher anything .Do people usually give their houseelves Christmas presents ?asked Harry prodding the parcel cautiously .Hermione would said Ron .But lets wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty .A moment later Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggots .Nice said Ron roaring with laughter .Very thoughtful .Id rather have them than that necklace said Harry which sobered Ron up at once .Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch everyone except Fleur on whom it appeared Mrs Weasley had not wanted to waste one and Mrs Weasley herself who was sporting a brandnew midnight blue witchs hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds and a spectacular golden necklace .Fred and George gave them to me !Arent they beautiful ?Well we find we appreciate you more and more Mum now were washing our own socks said George waving an airy hand .Parsnips Remus ?Harry youve got a maggot in your hair said Ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot .Ow orrible said Fleur with an affected little shudder .Yes isnt it ?said Ron .Gravy Fleur ?In his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat .You are as bad as zat Tonks said Fleur to Ron when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks .She is always knocking I invited dear Tonks to come along today said Mrs Weasley setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur .But she wouldnt come .Have you spoken to her lately Remus ?No I havent been in contact with anybody very much said Lupin .But Tonks has got her own family to go to hasnt she ?Hmmm said Mrs Weasley .Maybe .I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone actually .She gave Lupin an annoyed look as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughterinlaw instead of Tonks but Harry glancing across at Fleur who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork thought that Mrs Weasley was fighting a long lost battle .He was however reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks and who better to ask than Lupin the man who knew all about Patronuses ?Tonkss Patronus has changed its form he told him .Snape said so anyway .I didnt know that could happen .Why would your Patronus change ?Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly Sometimes .a great shock .an emotional upheaval .It looked big and it had four legs said Harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice .Hey .it couldnt be ?Arthur !said Mrs Weasley suddenly .She had risen from her chair her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window .Arthur its Percy !What ?Mr Weasley looked around .Everybody looked quickly at the window Ginny stood up for a better look .There sure enough was Percy Weasley striding across the snowy yard his hornrimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight .He was not however alone .Arthur hes hes with the Minister !And sure enough the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percys wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow .Before any of them could say anything before Mr and Mrs Weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks the back door opened and there stood Percy .There was a moments painful silence .Then Percy said rather stiffly Merry Christmas Mother .Oh Percy said Mrs Weasley and she threw herself into his arms .Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene .You must forgive this intrusion he said when Mrs Weasley looked around at him beaming and wiping her eyes .Percy and I were in the vicinity working you know and he couldnt resist dropping in and seeing you all .But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family .He stood pokerstraight and awkwardlooking and stared over everybody elses heads .Mr Weasley Fred and George were all observing him stonyfaced .Please come in sit down Minister !fluttered Mrs Weasley straightening her hat .Have a little purkey or some tooding .I mean No no my dear Molly said Scrimgeour .Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house .I dont want to intrude wouldnt be here at all if Percy hadnt wanted to see you all so badly .Oh Perce !said Mrs Weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him . .Weve only looked in for five minutes so Ill have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy .No no I assure you I dont want to butt in !Well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden .Ah that young mans finished why doesnt he take a stroll with me ?The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly .Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry .Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know Harrys name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny Fleur and George also had clean plates .Yeah all right said Harry into the silence .He was not fooled for all Scrimgeours talk that they had just been in the area that Percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone .Its fine he said quietly as he passed Lupin who had half risen from his chair .Fine he added as Mr Weasley opened his mouth to speak .Wonderful !said Scrimgeour standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him .Well just take a turn around the garden and Percy and Ill be off .Carry on everyone !Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys overgrown snowcovered garden Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side .He had Harry knew been Head of the Auror office he looked tough and battlescarred very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat .Charming said Scrimgeour stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants .Charming .Harry said nothing .He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him .Ive wanted to meet you for a very long time said Scrimgeour after a few moments .Did you know that ?No said Harry truthfully .Oh yes for a very long time .But Dumbledore has been very protective of you said Scrimgeour .Natural of course natural after what youve been through .Especially what happened at the Ministry He waited for Harry to say something but Harry did not oblige so he went on I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office but Dumbledore has most understandably as I say prevented this .Still Harry said nothing waiting .The rumors that have flown around !said Scrimgeour .Well of course we both know how these stories get distorted .all these whispers of a prophecy .of you being ‘the Chosen One .They were getting near it now Harry thought the reason Scrimgeour was here . .I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you ?Harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not .He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds and the scuffedup patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree .Finally he decided on the truth .or a bit of it .Yeah weve discussed it .Have you have you .said Scrimgeour .Harry could see out of the corner of his eye Scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron .And what has Dumbledore told you Harry ?Sorry but thats between us said Harry .He kept his voice as pleasant as he could and Scrimgeours tone too was light and friendly as he said Oh of course if its a question of confidences I wouldnt want you to divulge .no no .and in any case does it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One or not ?Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding .I dont really know what you mean Minister .Well of course to you it will matter enormously said Scrimgeour with a laugh .But to the Wizarding community at large .its all perception isnt it ?Its what people believe thats important .Harry said nothing .He thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there .The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it .People believe you are ‘the Chosen One you see said Scrimgeour .They think you quite the hero which of course you are Harry chosen or not !How many times have you faced HeWhoMustNotBe Named now ?Well anyway he pressed on without waiting for a reply the point is you are a symbol of hope for many Harry .The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy HeWhoMustNotBe Named well naturally it gives people a lift .And I cant help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the Ministry and give everyone a boost .The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm .It was now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground .Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said looking from Harry to the gnome Funny little chaps arent they ?But what say you Harry ?I dont exactly understand what you want said Harry slowly . ‘Stand alongside the Ministry .What does that mean ?Oh well nothing at all onerous I assure you said Scrimgeour .If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression .And of course while you were there you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards my successor as Head of the Auror office .Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror .Well that could be arranged very easily .Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry was she ?So basically he said as though he just wanted to clarify a few points youd like to give the impression that Im working for the Ministry ?It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved Harry said Scrimgeour sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly .The Chosen One you know .Its all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting things are happening .But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry said Harry still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly wont that seem as though I approve of what the Ministrys up to ?Well said Scrimgeour frowning slightly well yes thats partly why wed like No I dont think thatll work said Harry pleasantly .You see I dont like some of the things the Ministrys doing .Locking up Stan Shunpike for instance .Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly .I would not expect you to understand he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been .These are dangerous times and certain measures need to be taken .You are sixteen years old Dumbledores a lot older than sixteen and he doesnt think Stan should be in Azkaban either said Harry .Youre making Stan a scapegoat just like you want to make me a mascot .They looked at each other long and hard .Finally Scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth I see .You prefer like your hero Dumbledore to disassociate yourself from the Ministry ?I dont want to be used said Harry .Some would say its your duty to be used by the Ministry !Yeah and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison said Harry his temper rising now .Youre doing what Barty Crouch did .You never get it right you people do you ?Either weve got Fudge pretending everythings lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or weve got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend youve got ‘the Chosen One working for you !So youre not ‘the Chosen One ?said Scrimgeour .I thought you said it didnt matter either way ?said Harry with a bitter laugh .Not to you anyway .I shouldnt have said that said Scrimgeour quickly .It was tactless No it was honest said Harry .One of the only honest things youve said to me .You dont care whether I live or die but you do care that I help you convince everyone youre winning the war against Voldemort .I havent forgotten Minister .He raised his right fist .There shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh must not tell lies .I dont remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back .The Ministry wasnt so keen to be pals last year .They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet .The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush .What is Dumbledore up to ?said Scrimgeour brusquely .Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts ?No idea said Harry .And you wouldnt tell me if you knew said Scrimgeour would you ?No I wouldnt said Harry .Well then I shall have to see whether I cant find out by other means .You can try said Harry indifferently .But you seem cleverer than Fudge so Id have thought youd have learned from his mistakes .He tried interfering at Hogwarts .You might have noticed hes not Minister anymore but Dumbledores still headmaster .Id leave Dumbledore alone if I were you .There was a long pause .Well it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you said Scrimgeour his eyes cold and hard behind his wirerimmed glasses .Dumbledores man through and through arent you Potter ?Yeah I am said Harry .Glad we straightened that out .And turning his back on the Minister of Magic he strode back toward the house .A SLUGGISH MEMORY Late in the afternoon a few days after New Year Harry Ron and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts .The Ministry had arranged this oneoff connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school .Only Mrs Weasley was there to say goodbye as Mr Weasley Fred George Bill and Fleur were all at work .Mrs Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting .Admittedly it took very little to set her off lately she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip for which Fred George and Ginny all claimed credit .Dont cry Mum said Ginny patting her on the back as Mrs Weasley sobbed into her shoulder .Its okay .Yeah dont worry about us said Ron permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek or about Percy .Hes such a prat its not really a loss is it ?Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms .Promise me youll look after yourself .Stay out of trouble .I always do Mrs Weasley said Harry .I like a quiet life you know me .She gave a watery chuckle and stood back .Be good then all of you .Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted Hogwarts !He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys kitchen and Mrs Weasleys tearful face before the flames engulfed him spinning very fast he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look then he was slowing down finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagalls office .She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate .Evening Potter .Try not to get too much ash on the carpet .No Professor .Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view .When Ginny had arrived all three of them trooped out of McGonagalls office and off toward Gryffindor Tower .Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden .In the distance he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin .Baubles said Ron confidently when they reached the Fat Lady who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice .No she said .What dyou mean ‘no ?There is a new password she said .And please dont shout .But weve been away howre we supposed to ?Harry !Ginny !Hermione was hurrying toward them very pinkfaced and wearing a cloak hat and gloves .I got back a couple of hours ago Ive just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck I mean Witherwings she said breathlessly .Did you have a good Christmas ?Yeah said Ron at once pretty eventful Rufus Scrim Ive got something for you Harry said Hermione neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him .Oh hang on password .Abstinence .Precisely said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole .Whats up with her ?asked Harry .Overindulged over Christmas apparently said Hermione rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room .She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor .Anyway She rummaged in her pocket for a moment then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledores writing on it .Great said Harry unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night .Ive got loads to tell him and you .Lets sit down But at that moment there was a loud squeal of Won Won !and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Rons arms .Several onlookers sniggered Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said Theres a table over here .Coming Ginny ?No thanks I said Id meet Dean said Ginny though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic .Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match Harry led Hermione over to the spare table .So how was your Christmas ?Oh fine she shrugged .Nothing special .How was it at WonWons ?Ill tell you in a minute said Harry .Look Hermione cant you ?No I cant she said flatly .So dont even ask .I thought maybe you know over Christmas It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of fivehundred year old wine Harry not me .So what was this important news you wanted to tell me ?She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape .When he had finished Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said Dont you think ?he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what hes doing ?Well yes said Hermione .Rons dad and Lupin think so Harry said grudgingly .But this definitely proves Malfoys planning something you cant deny that .No I cant she answered slowly .And hes acting on Voldemorts orders just like I said !Hmm .did either of them actually mention Voldemorts name ?Harry frowned trying to remember .Im not sure .Snape definitely said your master and who else would that be ?I dont know said Hermione biting her lip .Maybe his father ?She stared across the room apparently lost in thought not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron .Hows Lupin ?Not great said Harry and he told her all about Lupins mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing .Have you heard of this Fenrir Grey back ?Yes I have !said Hermione sounding startled .And so have you Harry !When History of Magic ?You know full well I never listened .No no not History of Magic Malfoy threatened Borgin with him !said Hermione .Back in Knockturn Alley dont you remember ?He told Borgin that Grey back was an old family friend and that hed be checking up on Borgins progress !Harry gaped at her .I forgot !But this proves Malfoys a Death Eater how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do ?It is pretty suspicious breathed Hermione .Unless Oh come on said Harry in exasperation you cant get round this one !Well .there is the possibility it was an empty threat .Youre unbelievable you are said Harry shaking his head .Well see whos right .Youll be eating your words Hermione just like the Ministry .Oh yeah I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well .And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic for Hermione like Ron thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now .The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight .APPARITION LESSONS If you are seventeen years of age or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next you are eligible for a twelveweek course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor .Please sign below if you would like to participate .Cost 12 Galleons .Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom .Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him slipped her hands over his eyes and trilled Guess who WonWon ?Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off he caught up with her having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender but to his surprise Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled .Without a word Hermione sped up to walk with Neville .So Apparition said Ron his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened .Should be a laugh eh ?I dunno said Harry .Maybe its better when you do it yourself I didnt enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride .I forgot youd already done it .Id better pass my test first time said Ron looking anxious .Fred and George did .Charlie failed though didnt he ?Yeah but Charlies bigger than me Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla so Fred and George didnt go on about it much .not to his face anyway .When can we take the actual test ?Soon as were seventeen .Thats only March for me !Yeah but you wouldnt be able to Apparate in here not in the castle .Not the point is it ?Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted .Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition .All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will .How cool will it be when we can just Seamus clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance .Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me you wait till I can do it back .Hell never have another peaceful moment .Lost in visions of this happy prospect he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of todays Charms lesson he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face .Harrys already Apparated Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines I am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick .Dum er someone took him .SideAlong Apparition you know .Whoa !whispered Seamus and he Dean and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like .For the rest of the day Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition .All of them seemed awed rather than put off when he told them how uncomfortable it was and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore .The lamps in Dumbledore s office were lit the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more .Dumbledore s hands lay on either side of it the right one as blackened and burnt looking as ever .It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered for perhaps the hundredth time what had caused such a distinctive injury but did not ask Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was in any case another subject he wanted to discuss .But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy Dumbledore spoke .I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas ?Yes said Harry .Hes not very happy with me .No sighed Dumbledore .He is not very happy with me either .We must try not to sink beneath our anguish Harry but battle on .Harry grinned .He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministrys doing a wonderful job .Dumbledore smiled .It was Fudges idea originally you know .During his last days in office when he was trying desperately to cling to his post he sought a meeting with you hoping that you would give him your support After everything Fudge did last year ?said Harry angrily .After Umbridge ?I told Cornelius there was no chance of it but the idea did not die when he left office .Within hours of Scrimgeours appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you So thats why you argued !Harry blurted out .It was in the Daily Prophet The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally said Dumbledore if only accidentally .Yes that was why we argued .Well it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last .He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore s man through and through .How very rude of him .I told him I was .Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again .Behind Harry Fawkes the phoenix let out a low soft musical cry .To Harrys intense embarrassment he suddenly realized that Dumbledore s bright blue eyes looked rather watery and stared hastily at his own knees .When Dumbledore spoke however his voice was quite steady .I am very touched Harry .Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when youre not at Hogwarts said Harry still looking fixedly at his knees .Yes he is very nosy about that said Dumbledore now sounding cheerful and Harry thought it safe to look up again .He has even attempted to have me followed .Amusing really .He set Dawlish to tail me .It wasnt kind .I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once I did it again with the greatest regret .So they still dont know where you go ?asked Harry hoping for more information on this intriguing subject but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his halfmoon spectacles .No they dont and the time is not quite right for you to know either .Now I suggest we press on unless theres anything else ?There is actually sir said Harry .Its about Malfoy and Snape .Professor Snape Harry .Yes sir .I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party .well I followed them actually .Dumbledore listened to Harrys story with an impassive face .When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments then said Thank you for telling me this Harry but I suggest that you put it out of your mind .I do not think that it is of great importance .Not of great importance ?repeated Harry incredulously .Professor did you understand ?Yes Harry blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower I understood everything you told me said Dumbledore a little sharply .I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did .Again I am glad that you have confided in me but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet .Harry sat in seething silence glaring at Dumbledore .What was going on ?Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape ?Or was he really worried by what he had heard but pretending not to be ?So sir said Harry in what he hoped was a polite calm voice you definitely still trust ?I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already said Dumbledore but he did not sound very tolerant anymore .My answer has not changed .I should think not said a snide voice Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep .Dumbledore ignored him .And now Harry I must insist that we press on .I have more important things to discuss with you this evening .Harry sat there feeling mutinous .How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy ?As though he had read Harrys mind Dumbledore shook his head .Ah Harry how often this happens even between the best of friends !Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute !I dont think what youve got to say is unimportant sir said Harry stiffly .Well you are quite right because it is not said Dumbledore briskly .I have two more memories to show you this evening both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is I think the most important I have collected .Harry did not say anything to this he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further .So said Dumbledore in a ringing voice we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts .You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley and that I in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school .Well the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle a quiet boy in his secondhand robes who lined up with the other first years to be sorted .He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head continued Dumbledore waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat ancient and unmoving .How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes I do not know perhaps that very evening .The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of selfimportance .However if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room no hint of it reached the staff .He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all .As an unusually talented and very goodlooking orphan he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival .He seemed polite quiet and thirsty for knowledge .Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him .Didnt you tell them sir what hed been like when you met him at the orphanage ?asked Harry .No I did not .Though he had shown no hint of remorse it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf .I chose to give him that chance .Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry who had opened his mouth to speak .Here again was Dumbledore s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it !But then Harry remembered something .But you didnt really trust him sir did you ?He told me .the Riddle who came out of that diary said ‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did .Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy said Dumbledore .I had as I have already indicated resolved to keep a close eye upon him and so I did .I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first .He was very guarded with me he felt I am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much .He was careful never to reveal as much again but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement nor what Mrs Cole had confided in me .However he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues .As he moved up the school he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends I call them that for want of a better term although as I have already indicated Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them .This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle .They were a motley collection a mixture of the weak seeking protection the ambitious seeking some shared glory and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty .In other words they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts .Rigidly controlled by Riddle they were never detected in open wrongdoing although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked the most serious of which was of course the opening of the Chamber of Secrets which resulted in the death of a girl .As you know Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime .I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts said Dumbledore placing his withered hand on the Pensieve .Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him they are too terrified .What I know I found out after he had left Hogwarts after much painstaking effort after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike .Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage .This is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there .It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room on the lists of prefects in the old school records even in the books of Wizarding history .Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts .I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort and began his investigations into his previously despised mothers family the woman whom you will remember he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death .All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mothers fathers name .Finally after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families he discovered the existence of Slytherins surviving line .In the summer of his sixteenth year he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives .And now Harry if you will stand .Dumbledore rose and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling pearly memory .I was very lucky to collect this he said as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve .As you will understand when we have experienced it .Shall we ?Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness .It took him several seconds to recognize the place by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him .The Gaunts house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen .The ceiling was thick with cobwebs the floor coated in grime moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots .The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth .He was slumped in an armchair by the fire and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead .But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left .The door creaked open .There on the threshold holding an oldfashioned lamp stood a boy Harry recognized at once tall pale darkhaired and handsome the teenage Voldemort .Voldemorts eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair .For a few seconds they looked at each other then the man staggered upright the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor .YOU !he bellowed .YOU !And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle wand and knife held aloft .Stop .Riddle spoke in Parseltongue .The man skidded into the table sending moldy pots crashing to the floor .He stared at Riddle .There was a long silence while they contemplated each other .The man broke it .You speak it ?Yes I speak it said Riddle .He moved forward into the room allowing the door to swing shut behind him .Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemorts complete lack of fear .His face merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment .Where is Marvolo ?he asked .Dead said the other .Died years ago didnt he ?Riddle frowned .Who are you then ?Im Morfin aint 1 ?Marvolo s son ?Course I am then .Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face the better to see Riddle and Harry saw that he wore Marvolos blackstoned ring on his right hand .I thought you was that Muggle whispered Morfin .You look mighty like that Muggle .What Muggle ?said Riddle sharply .That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way said Morfin and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them .You look right like him .Riddle .But hes older now in e ?Hes oldern you now I think on it .Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support .He come back see he added stupidly .Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities .Now he moved a little closer and said Riddle came back ?Ar he left her and serve her right marrying filth said Morfin spitting on the floor again .Robbed us mind before she ran off !Wheres the locket eh wheres Slytherins locket ?Voldemort did not answer .Morfin was working himself into a rage again he brandished his knife and shouted Dishonored us she did that little slut !And whore you coming here and asking questions about all that ?Its over innit .Its over .He looked away staggering slightly and Voldemort moved forward .As he did so an unnatural darkness fell extinguishing Voldemorts lamp and Morfin s candle extinguishing everything .Dumbledores fingers closed tightly around Harrys arm and they were soaring back into the present again .The soft golden light in Dumbledores office seemed to dazzle Harrys eyes after that impenetrable darkness .Is that all ?said Harry at once .Why did it go dark what happened ?Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward said Dumbledore gesturing Harry back into his seat .When he awoke next morning he was lying on the floor quite alone .Marvolos ring had gone .Meanwhile in the village of Little Hangleton a maid was running along the High Street screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father .The Muggle authorities were perplexed .As far as I am aware they do not know to this day how the Riddles died for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage .The exception sits before me Dumbledore added with a nod to Harrys scar .The Ministry on the other hand knew at once that this was a wizards murder .They also knew that a convicted Mugglehater lived across the valley from the Riddle house a Mugglehater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people .So the Ministry called upon Morfin .They did not need to question him to use Veritaserum or Legilimency .He admitted to the murder on the spot giving details only the murderer could know .He was proud he said to have killed the Muggles had been awaiting his chance all these years .He handed over his wand which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles .And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight .All that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared . ‘Hell kill me for losing it he told his captors over and over again . ‘Hell kill me for losing his ring .And that apparently was all he ever said again .He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban lamenting the loss of Marvolos last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls .So Voldemort stole Morfins wand and used it ?said Harry sitting up straight .Thats right said Dumbledore .We have no memories to show us this but I think we can be fairly sure what happened .Voldemort Stupefied his uncle took his wand and proceeded across the valley to ‘the big house over the way .There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother and for good measure his Muggle grandparents thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him .Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncles mind laid Morfins wand beside its unconscious owner pocketed the ancient ring he wore and departed .And Morfin never realized he hadnt done it ?Never said Dumbledore .He gave as I say a full and boastful confession .But he had this real memory in him all the time !Yes but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him said Dumbledore and why should anybody delve further into Morfins mind when he had already confessed to the crime ?However I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemorts past .I extracted this memory with difficulty .When I saw what it contained I attempted to use it to secure Morfins release from Azkaban .Before the Ministry reached their decision however Morfin had died .But how come the Ministry didnt realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin ?Harry asked angrily .He was underage at the time wasnt he ?I thought they could detect underage magic !You are quite right they can detect magic but not the perpetrator You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was in fact cast by Dobby growled Harry this injustice still rankled .So if youre underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizards house the Ministry wont know ?They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic said Dumbledore smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face .They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offsprings obedience while within their walls .Well thats rubbish snapped Harry .Look what happened here look what happened to Morfin !I agree said Dumbledore .Whatever Morfin was he did not deserve to die as he did blamed for murders he had not committed .But it is getting late and I want you to see this other memory before we part .Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected .Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve as though they had congealed slightly did memories go bad ?This will not take long said Dumbledore when he had finally emptied the phial .We shall be back before you know it .Once more into the Pensieve then And Harry fell again through the silver surface landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once .It was a much younger Horace Slughorn .Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick shiny strawcolored hair quite disconcerting it looked as though he had had his head thatched though there was already a shiny Galleonsized bald patch on his crown .His mustache less massive than it was these days was gingery blond .He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain .His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair one hand grasping a small glass of wine the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple .Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn s office .Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn all on harder or lower seats than his and all in their midteens .Harry recognized Voldemort at once .His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys .His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolos goldand black ring he had already killed his father .Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ?he asked .Tom Tom if I knew I couldnt tell you said Slughorn wagging a reproving sugarcovered finger at Riddle though ruining the effect slightly by winking .I must say Id like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are .Riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks .What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnt and your careful flattery of the people who matter thank you for the pineapple by the way youre quite right it is my favorite As several of the boys tittered something very odd happened .The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore who was standing beside him .Then Slughorn s voice rang out through the mist unnaturally loudly Youll go wrong boy mark my words .The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened .Bewildered Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorns desk chimed eleven oclock .Good gracious is it that time already ?said Slughorn .Youd better get going boys or well all be in trouble .Lestrange I want your essay by tomorrow or its detention .Same goes for you Avery .Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out .Voldemort however stayed behind .Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn .Look sharp Tom said Slughorn turning around and finding him still present .You dont want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect .Sir I wanted to ask you something .Ask away then mboy ask away .Sir I wondered what you know about .about Horcruxes ?And it happened all over again The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all only Dumbledore smiling serenely beside him .Then Slughorns voice boomed out again just as it had done before .I dont know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldnt tell you if I did !Now get out of here at once and dont let me catch you mentioning them again Well thats that said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry .Time to go .And Harrys feet left the floor to fall seconds later back onto the mg in front of Dumbledores desk .Thats all there is ?said Harry blankly .Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all but he could not see what was so significant about it .Admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it was odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer .As you might have noticed said Dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk that memory has been tampered with .Tampered with ?repeated Harry sitting back down too .Certainly said Dumbledore .Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections .But why would he do that ?Because I think he is ashamed of what he remembers said Dumbledore .He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see .It is as you will have noticed very crudely done and that is all to the good for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations .And so for the first time I am giving you homework Harry .It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all .Harry stared at him .But surely sir he said keeping his voice as respectful as possible you dont need me you could use Legilimency .or Veritaserum .Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both said Dumbledore .He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection .No I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force and might do much more harm than good I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts .However he has his weaknesses like the rest of us and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses .It is most important that we secure the true memory Harry .How important we will only know when we have seen the real thing .So good luck .and good night .A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal Harry got to his feet quickly .Good night sir .As he closed the study door behind him he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say I cant see why the boy should be able to do it better than you Dumbledore .I wouldnt expect you to Phineas replied Dumbledore and Fawkes gave another low musical cry .BIRTHDAY SURPRISES The next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him though separately for Hermione still refused to remain in Rons presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look .Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all .He loves you he said over breakfast waving an airy forkful of fried egg .Wont refuse you anything will he ?Not his little Potions Prince .Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him .Hermione however took a gloomier view .He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldnt get it out of him she said in a low voice as they stood in the deserted snowy courtyard at break .Horcruxes .Horcruxes .Ive never even heard of them .You havent ?Harry was disappointed he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were .They must be really advanced Dark Magic or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them ?I think its going to be difficult to get the information Harry youll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn think out a strategy .Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon .Oh well if WonWon thinks that youd better do it she said flaring up at once .After all when has Won Wons judgment ever been faulty ?Hermione cant you ?iVo !she said angrily and stormed away leaving Harry alone and ankledeep in snow .Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days seeing as Harry Ron and Hermione had to share a desk .Today Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie and ignored both Harry and Ron .Whatve you done ?Ron muttered to Harry looking at Hermione s haughty profile .But before Harry could answer Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room .Settle down settle down please !Quickly now lots of work to get through this afternoon !Golpalotts Third Law .who can tell me ?But Miss Granger can of course !Hermione recited at top speed GolpalottsThird Lawstatesthattheantidoteforablendedpoison willbeequaltomorethanthesumoftheantidotes foreachoftheseparatecomponents .Precisely !beamed Slughorn .Ten points for Gryffindor !Now if we accept Golpalotts Third Law as true .Harry was going to have to take Slughorn s word for it that Golpalotts Third Law was true because he had not understood any of it .Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either . .which means of course that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potions ingredients by Scarpins Revelaspell our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves but to find that added component that will by an almost alchemical process transform these disparate elements Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced PotionMaking .Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on . .and so finished Slughorn I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk .You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson .Good luck and dont forget your protective gloves !Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn s desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move and by the time Harry Ron and Ernie returned to the table she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it .Its a shame that the Prince wont be able to help you much with this Harry she said brightly as she straightened up .You have to understand the principles involved this time .No shortcuts or cheats !Annoyed Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorns desk which was a garish shade of pink tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it .He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next .He glanced around at Ron who was now standing there looking rather gormless having copied everything Harry had done .You sure the Prince hasnt got any tips ?Ron muttered to Harry .Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes .There was Golpalotts Third Law stated word for word as Hermione had recited it but not a single illuminating note in the Princes hand to explain what it meant .Apparently the Prince like Hermione had had no difficulty understanding it .Nothing said Harry gloomily .Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron .Unfortunately they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud .Ernie Macmillan however was muttering Specialis Reveliol over his cauldron which sounded impressive so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him .It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potionmaker in the class was crashing around his ears .Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did and instead had withdrawn his head hastily coughing as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him .Hermiones expression could not have been any smugger she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class .She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials .More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else Harry bent over the HalfBlood Princes book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force .And there it was scrawled right across a long list of antidotes Just shove a bezoar down their throats .Harry stared at these words for a moment .Hadnt he once long ago heard of bezoars ?Hadnt Snape mentioned them in their firstever Potions lesson ?A stone taken from the stomach of a goat which will protect from most poisons .It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem and had Snape still been their teacher Harry would not have dared do it but this was a moment for desperate measures .He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found at the very back a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars .He opened the box just as Slughorn called Two minutes left everyone !Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects looking more like driedup kidneys than real stones .Harry seized one put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron .Times .UP !called Slughorn genially .Well lets see how youve done !Blaise .what have you got for me ?Slowly Slughorn moved around the room examining the various antidotes .Nobody had finished the task although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her .Ron had given up completely and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron .Harry stood there waiting the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand .Slughorn reached their table last .He sniffed Ernies potion and passed on to Rons with a grimace .He did not linger over Rons cauldron but backed away swiftly retching slightly .And you Harry he said .What have you got to show me ?Harry held out his hand the bezoar sitting on his palm .Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds .Harry wondered for a moment whether he was going to shout at him .Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter .Youve got nerve boy !he boomed taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it .Oh youre like your mother .Well I cant fault you .A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions !Hermione who was sweatyfaced and had soot on her nose looked livid .Her halffinished antidote comprising fiftytwo ingredients including a chunk of her own hair bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn who had eyes for nobody but Harry .And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself did you Harry ?she asked through gritted teeth .Thats the individual spirit a real potionmaker needs !said Slughorn happily before Harry could reply .Just like his mother she had the same intuitive grasp of potionmaking its undoubtedly from Lily he gets it .Yes Harry yes if youve got a bezoar to hand of course that would do the trick .although as they dont work on everything and are pretty rare its still worth knowing how to mix antidotes .The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy who Harry was pleased to see had spilled something that looked like catsick over himself .Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work however the bell rang .Time to pack up !said Slughorn .And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek !Still chuckling he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon .Harry dawdled behind taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag .Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left both looked rather annoyed .At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room .Come on now Harry youll be late for your next lesson said Slughorn affably snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon skin briefcase .Sir said Harry reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort I wanted to ask you something .Ask away then my dear boy ask away .Sir I wondered what you know about .about Horcruxes ?Slughorn froze .His round face seemed to sink in upon itself .He licked his lips and said hoarsely What did you say ?I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes sir .You see Dumbledore put you up to this whispered Slughorn .His voice had changed completely .It was not genial anymore but shocked terrified .He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief mopping his sweating brow .Dumbledores shown you that that memory .Well ?Hasnt he ?Yes said Harry deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie .Yes of course said Slughorn quietly still dabbing at his white face .Of course .well if youve seen that memory Harry youll know that I dont know anything anything he repeated the word forcefully about Horcruxes .He seized his dragonskin briefcase stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door .Sir said Harry desperately I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory Did you ?said Slughorn .Then you were wrong werent you ?WRONG !He bellowed the last word and before Harry could say another word slammed the dungeon door behind him .Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview .Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly .Ron was resentful that Harry hadnt slipped him a bezoar too .It wouldve just looked stupid if wed both done it !said Harry irritably .Look I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort didnt I ?Oh will you get a grip he added in exasperation as Ron winced at the sound of the name .Infuriated by his failure and by Rons and Hermiones attitudes Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn .He decided that for the time being he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack .When Harry did not question Slughorn again the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him and appeared to have put the matter from his mind .Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties determined to accept this time even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice .Unfortunately however no such invitation arrived .Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny Neither of them had received an invitation and nor as far as they knew had anybody else .Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him .Meanwhile the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory .She was so shocked she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar .I havent found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do !she told him .Not a single one !Ive been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions nothing !All I could find was this in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile listen ‘Of the Horcrux wickedest of magical inventions we shall not speak nor give direction .I mean why mention it then ?she said impatiently slamming the old book shut it let out a ghostly wail .Oh shut up she snapped stuffing it back into her bag .The snow melted around the school as February arrived to be replaced by cold dreary wetness .Purplishgray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy .The upshot of this was that the sixth years first Apparition lesson which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds .When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall Ron had come down with Lavender they found that the tables had disappeared .Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall Snape Flitwick and Sprout the Heads of Houses and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry .He was oddly colorless with transparent eyelashes wispy hair and an insubstantial air as though a single gust of wind might blow him away .Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish .Good morning said the Ministry wizard when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet .My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks .I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time Malfoy be quiet and pay attention !barked Professor McGonagall .Everybody looked around .Malfoy had flushed a dull pink he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument .Harry glanced quickly at Snape who also looked annoyed though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoys rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House .by which time many of you may be ready to take your tests Twycross continued as though there had been no interruption .As you may know it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts .The headmaster has lifted this enchantment purely within the Great Hall for one hour so as to enable you to practice .May I emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall and that you would be unwise to try .I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you .There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated banged into each other and ordered others out of their space .The Heads of Houses moved among the students marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments .Harry where are you going ?demanded Hermione .But Harry did not answer he was moving quickly through the crowd past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws all of whom wanted to be near the front past Professor Sprout who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line until by dodging around Ernie Macmillan he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd directly behind Malfoy who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe standing five feet away and looking mutinous .I dont know how much longer all right ?Malfoy shot at him oblivious to Harry standing right behind him .Its taking longer than I thought it would .Crabbe opened his mouth but Malfoy appeared to secondguess what he was going to say .Look its none of your business what Im doing Crabbe you and Goyle just do as youre told and keep a lookout !I tell my friends what Im up to if I want them to keep a lookout for me Harry said just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him .Malfoy spun around on the spot his hand flying to his wand but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted Quiet !and silence fell again .Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again .Thank you said Twycross .Now then .He waved his wand .Oldfashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student .The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds !said Twycross .Destination Determination Deliberation !Step one Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination said Twycross .In this case the interior of your hoop .Kindly concentrate upon that destination now .Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop then hastily did as they were told .Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else .This proved impossible as he couldnt stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts .Step two said Twycross focus your determination to occupy the visualized space !Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body !Harry glanced around surreptitiously .A little way to his left Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quafflesized egg .Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop .Step three called Twycross and only when I give the command .Turn on the spot feeling your way into nothingness moving with deliberation !On my command now .one Harry glanced around again lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly .two Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for .THREE !Harry spun on the spot lost balance and nearly fell over .He was not the only one .The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people Neville was flat on his back Ernie Macmillan on the other hand had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him .Never mind never mind said Twycross dryly who did not seem to have expected anything better .Adjust your hoops please and back to your original positions .The second attempt was no better than the first .The third was just as bad .Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen .There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around terrified to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started .The Heads of House converged on her there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing reunited with her leg but looking horrified .Splinching or the separation of random body parts said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined .You must concentrate continuously upon your destination and move without haste but with deliberation .thus .Twycross stepped forward turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes reappearing at the back of the Hall .Remember the three Ds he said and try again .one two three But an hour later Susans Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened .Twycross did not seem discouraged .Fastening his cloak at his neck he merely said Until next Saturday everybody and do not forget Destination .Determination .Deliberation .With that he waved his wand Vanishing the hoops and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall .Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall .How did you do ?asked Ron hurrying toward Harry .I think I felt something the last time I tried a kind of tingling in my feet .I expect your trainers are too small WonWon said a voice behind them and Hermione stalked past smirking .I didnt feel anything said Harry ignoring this interruption .But I dont care about that now What dyou mean you dont care ?Dont you want to learn to Apparate ?said Ron incredulously .Im not fussed really I prefer flying said Harry glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall .Look hurry up will you theres something I want to do .Perplexed Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at a run .They were temporarily detained by Peeves who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts .Within five minutes they were climbing through the portrait hole .Are you going to tell me what were doing then ?asked Ron panting slightly .Up here said Harry and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys staircase .Their dormitory was as Harry had hoped empty .He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it while Ron watched impatiently .Harry .Malfoy s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts .He was arguing with Crabbe just now .I want to know aha .He had found it a folded square of apparently blank parchment which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand .I solemnly swear that I am up to no good .or Malfoy is anyway .At once the Marauders Map appeared on the parchments surface .Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castles floors and moving around it the tiny labeled black dots that signified each of the castles occupants .Help me find Malfoy said Harry urgently .He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it searching .There !said Ron after a minute or so .Hes in the Slytherin common room look .with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle .Harry looked down at the map disappointed but rallied almost at once .Well Im keeping an eye on him from now on he said firmly .And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside itll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what hes He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory bringing with him a strong smell of singed material and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants .Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks .Although he consulted the map as often as he could sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious .Admittedly he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them but impossible to locate on the map at all .This was most mysterious .Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds but could not see how he could be doing it given the very high level of security now operating within the castle .He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map .As for the fact that Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable these things happened as people got older Ron and Hermione Harry reflected sadly were living proof .February moved toward March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet .To general indignation a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled .Ron was furious .It was on my birthday !he said .I was looking forward to that !Not a big surprise though is it ?said Harry .Not after what happened to Katie .She had still not returned from St .Mungos .What was more further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet including several relatives of students at Hogwarts .But now all Ive got to look forward to is stupid Apparition !said Ron grumpily .Big birthday treat .Three lessons on Apparition was proving as difficult as ever though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves .Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of illfeeling toward Wilkie Twycross and his three Ds which had inspired a number of nicknames for him the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead .Happy birthday Ron said Harry when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast .Have a present .He threw the package across onto Rons bed where it joined a small pile of them that must Harry assumed have been delivered by houseelves in the night .Cheers said Ron drowsily and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed opened his own trunk and began rummaging in it for the Marauders Map which he hid after every use .He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolledup socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion Felix Felicis .Right he murmured taking it back to bed with him tapping it quietly and murmuring I solemnly swear that I am up to no good so that Neville who was passing the foot of his bed at the time would not hear .Nice one Harry !said Ron enthusiastically waving the new pair of Quidditch Keepers gloves Harry had given him .No problem said Harry absentmindedly as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy .Hey .I dont think hes in his bed .Ron did not answer he was too busy unwrapping presents every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure .Seriously good haul this year !he announced holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands .See what Mum and Dad got me ?Blimey I think Ill come of age next year too .Cool muttered Harry sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map .Where was Malfoy ?He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall eating breakfast .He was nowhere near Snape who was sitting in his study .He wasnt in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing .Want one ?said Ron thickly holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons .No thanks said Harry looking up .Malfoys gone again !Cant have done said Ron stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed .Come on if you dont hurry up youll have to Apparate on an empty stomach .Might make it easier I suppose .Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons then shrugged and helped himself to a third .Harry tapped the map with his wand muttered Mischief managed though it hadnt been and got dressed thinking hard .There had to be an explanation for Malfoys periodic disappearances but he simply could not think what it could be .The best way of finding out would be to tail him but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea Harry had lessons Quidditch practice homework and Apparition he could not follow Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon .Ready ?he said to Ron .He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved but was leaning on his bedpost staring out of the rainwashed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face .Ron ?Breakfast .Im not hungry .Harry stared at him .I thought you just said ?Well all right Ill come down with you sighed Ron but I dont want to eat .Harry scrutinized him suspiciously .Youve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons havent you ?Its not that Ron sighed again .You .you wouldnt understand .Fair enough said Harry albeit puzzled as he turned to open the door .Harry !said Ron suddenly .What ?Harry I cant stand it !You cant stand what ?asked Harry now starting to feel definitely alarmed .Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick .I cant stop thinking about her !said Ron hoarsely .Harry gaped at him .He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it .Friends they might be but if Ron started calling Lavender LavLav he would have to put his foot down .Why does that stop you having breakfast ?Harry asked trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings .I dont think she knows I exist said Ron with a desperate gesture .She definitely knows you exist said Harry bewildered .She keeps snogging you doesnt she ?Ron blinked .Who are you talking about ?Who are you talking about ?said Harry with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation .Romilda Vane said Ron softly and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight .They stared at each other for almost a whole minute before Harry said This is a joke right ?Youre joking .I think .Harry I think I love her said Ron in a strangled voice .Okay said Harry walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion okay .Say that again with a straight face .I love her repeated Ron breathlessly .Have you seen her hair its all black and shiny and silky .and her eyes ?Her big dark eyes ?And her This is really funny and everything said Harry impatiently but jokes over all right ?Drop it .He turned to leave he had got two steps toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear .Staggering he looked around .Rons fist was drawn right back his face was contorted with rage he was about to strike again .Harry reacted instinctively his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought Levicorpus Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more he dangled helplessly upside down his robes hanging off him .What was that for ?Harry bellowed .You insulted her Harry !You said it was a joke !shouted Ron who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head .This is insane !said Harry .Whats got into ?And then he saw the box lying open on Rons bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll .Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons ?They were a birthday present !shouted Ron revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free .I offered you one didnt I ?You just picked them up off the floor didnt you ?Theyd fallen off my bed all right ?Let me go !They didnt fall off your bed you prat dont you understand ?They were mine I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map theyre the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and theyre all spiked with love potion !But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron .Romilda ?he repeated .Did you say Romilda ?Harry do you know her ?Can you introduce me ?Harry stared at the dangling Ron whose face now looked tremendously hopeful and fought a strong desire to laugh .A part of him the part closest to his throbbing right ear was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off .But on the other hand they were supposed to be friends Ron had not been himself when he had attacked and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane .Yeah Ill introduce you said Harry thinking fast .Im going to let you down now okay ?He sent Ron crashing back to the floor his ear did hurt quite a lot but Ron simply bounded to his feet again grinning .Shell be in Slughorns office said Harry confidently leading the way to the door .Why will she be in there ?asked Ron anxiously hurrying to keep up .Oh she has extra Potions lessons with him said Harry inventing wildly .Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her ?said Ron eagerly .Great idea said Harry .Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole a complication Harry had not foreseen .Youre late WonWon !she pouted .Ive got you a birthday Leave me alone said Ron impatiently .Harrys going to introduce me to Romilda Vane .And without another word to her he pushed his way out of the portrait hole .Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender but it might have turned out simply amused because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them .Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast but he answered his office door at the first knock wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather blearyeyed .Harry he mumbled .This is very early for a call .I generally sleep late on a Saturday .Professor Im really sorry to disturb you said Harry as quietly as possible while Ron stood on tiptoe attempting to see past Slughorn into his room but my friend Rons swallowed a love potion by mistake .You couldnt make him an antidote could you ?Id take him to Madam Pomfrey but were not supposed to have anything from Weasleys Wizard Wheezes and you know .awkward questions .Id have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy Harry an expert potioneer like you ?asked Slughorn .Er said Harry somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room well Ive never mixed an antidote for a love potion sir and by the time I get it right Ron mightve done something serious Helpfully Ron chose this moment to moan I cant see her Harry is he hiding her ?Was this potion within date ?asked Slughorn now eyeing Ron with professional interest .They can strengthen you know the longer theyre kept .That would explain a lot panted Harry now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over .Its his birthday Professor he added imploringly .Oh all right come in then come in said Slughorn relenting .Ive got the necessary here in my bag its not a difficult antidote .Ron burst through the door into Slughorn s overheated crowded study tripped over a tasseled footstool regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and muttered She didnt see that did she ?Shes not here yet said Harry watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle .Thats good said Ron fervently .How do I look ?Very handsome said Slughorn smoothly handing Ron a glass of clear liquid .Now drink that up its a tonic for the nerves keep you calm when she arrives you know .Brilliant said Ron eagerly and he gulped the antidote down noisily .Harry and Slughorn watched him .For a moment Ron beamed at them .Then very slowly his grin sagged and vanished to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror .Back to normal then ?said Harry grinning .Slughorn chuckled .Thanks a lot Professor .Dont mention it mboy dont mention it said Slughorn as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair looking devastated .Pickmeup thats what he needs Slughorn continued now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks .Ive got butterbeer Ive got wine Ive got one last bottle of this oakmatured mead .hmm .meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas .ah well .He shrugged .He cant miss what hes never had !Why dont we open it now and celebrate Mr Weasleys birthday ?Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love .He chortled again and Harry joined in .This was the first time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him .Perhaps if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood .perhaps if they got through enough of the oakmatured mead .There you are then said Slughorn handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each before raising his own .Well a very happy birthday Ralph Ron whispered Harry .But Ron who did not appear to be listening to the toast had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it .There was one second hardly more than a heartbeat in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn it seemed did not .and may you have many more Ron Ron had dropped his glass he halfrose from his chair and then crumpled his extremities jerking uncontrollably .Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets .Professor !Harry bellowed .Do something !But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock .Ron twitched and choked His skin was turning blue .What but spluttered Slughorn .Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn s open potion kit pulling out jars and pouches while the terrible sound of Rons gargling breath filled the room .Then he found it the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions .He hurtled back to Rons side wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth .Ron gave a great shudder a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still .ELF TAILS So all in all not one of Rons better birthdays ?said Fred .It was evening the hospital wing was quiet the windows curtained the lamps lit .Rons was the only occupied bed .Harry Hermione and Ginny were sitting around him they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out .Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight oclock .Fred and George had arrived at ten past .This isnt how we imagined handing over our present said George grimly putting down a large wrapped gift on Rons bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny .Yeah when we pictured the scene he was conscious said Fred .There we were in Hogsmeade waiting to surprise him said George .You were in Hogsmeade ?asked Ginny looking up .We were thinking of buying Zonkos said Fred gloomily .A Hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good itll do us if you lot arent allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore .But never mind that now .He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Rons pale face .How exactly did it happen Harry ?Harry retold the story he had already recounted it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore to McGonagall to Madam Pomfrey to Hermione and to Ginny . .and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit Slughorn ran for help McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up and they brought Ron up here .They reckon hell be all right .Madam Pomfrey says hell have to stay here a week or so .keep taking essence of rue .Blimey it was lucky you thought of a bezoar said George in a low voice .Lucky there was one in the room said Harry who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone .Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff .She had been exceptionally quiet all day .Having hurtled whitefaced up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginnys obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned but merely stood beside them clenchjawed and frightenedlooking until at last they had been allowed in to see him .Do Mum and Dad know ?Fred asked Ginny .Theyve already seen him they arrived an hour ago theyre in Dumbledores office now but theyll be back soon .There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep .So the poison was in the drink ?said Fred quietly .Yes said Harry at once he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again .Slughorn poured it out Would he have been able to slip something into Rons glass without you seeing ?Probably said Harry but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron ?No idea said Fred frowning .You dont think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake ?Meaning to get you ?Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry ?asked Ginny .I dunno said Fred but there must be loads of people whod like to poison Harry mustnt there ?The Chosen One and all that ?So you think Slughorn s a Death Eater ?said Ginny .Anythings possible said Fred darkly .He could be under the Imperius Curse said George .Or he could be innocent said Ginny .The poison could have been in the bottle in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself .Whod want to kill Slughorn ?Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side said Harry .Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts .And .He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn .And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore .But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas Ginny reminded him .So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore .Then the poisoner didnt know Slughorn very well said Hermione speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold .Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance hed keep something that tasty for himself .Ermynee croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them .They all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring .The dormitory doors flew open making them all jump Hagrid came striding toward them his hair rainflecked his bearskin coat flapping behind him a crossbow in his hand leaving a trail of muddy dolphinsized footprints all over the floor .Bin in the forest all day !he panted .Aragogs worse I bin readin to him didn get up ter dinner till jus now an then Professor Sprout told me abou Ron !How is he ?Not bad said Harry .They say hell be okay .No more than six visitors at a time !said Madam Pomfrey hurrying out of her office .Hagrid makes six George pointed out .Oh .yes .said Madam Pomfrey who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness .To cover her confusion she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand .I don believe this said Hagrid hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron .Jus don believe it .Look at him lyin there .Whod want ter hurt him eh ?Thats just what we were discussing said Harry .We dont know .Someone couldn have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team could they ?said Hagrid anxiously .Firs Katie now Ron .I cant see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team said George .Wood mightve done the Slytherins if he couldve got away with it said Fred fairly .Well I dont think its Quidditch but I think theres a connection between the attacks said Hermione quietly .How dyou work that out ?asked Fred .Well for one thing they both ought to have been fatal and werent although that was pure luck .And for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed .Of course she added broodingly that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they dont seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim .Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory doors opened again and Mr and Mrs Weasley hurried up the ward .They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward now Mrs Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tightly .Dumbledores told us how you saved him with the bezoar she sobbed .Oh Harry what can we say ?You saved Ginny .you saved Arthur .now youve saved Ron .Dont be .I didnt .muttered Harry awkwardly .Half our family does seem to owe you their lives now I stop and think about it Mr Weasley said in a constricted voice .Well all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express Harry .Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Rons bed he and Hermione rose at once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them leaving Ron with his family .Its terrible growled Hagrid into his beard as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase .All this new security an kids are still gettin hurt .Dumbledores worried sick .He don say much but I can tell .Hasnt he got any ideas Hagrid ?asked Hermione desperately .I spect hes got hundreds of ideas brain like his said Hagrid .But he doesn know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine or theyd ve bin caught wouldn they ?Wha worries me said Hagrid lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder Harry for good measure checked the ceiling for Peeves is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein attacked .Chamber o Secrets all over again isn it ?Therell be panic more parents takin their kids outta school an nex thing yeh know the board o governors .Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a longhaired woman drifted serenely past then resumed in a hoarse whisper .the board o governorsll be talkin about shuttin us up fer good .Surely not ?said Hermione looking worried .Gotta see it from their point o view said Hagrid heavily .I mean its always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts hasn it ?Yer expect accidents don yeh with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether but attempted murder thas diffrent .Sno wonder Dumbledores angry with Sn Hagrid stopped in his tracks a familiar guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard .What ?said Harry quickly .Dumbledores angry with Snape ?I never said tha said Hagrid though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway .Look at the time its gettin on fer midnight I need ter Hagrid why is Dumbledore angry with Snape ?Harry asked loudly .Shhhh !said Hagrid looking both nervous and angry .Don shout stuff like that Harry dyeh wan me ter lose me job ?Mind I don suppose yehd care would yeh not now yehve given up Care of Mag Dont try and make me feel guilty it wont work !said Harry forcefully .Whats Snape done ?I dunno Harry I shouldnta heard it at all !I well I was cornin outta the forest the other evenin an I overheard em talking well arguin .Didnt like ter draw attention to meself so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen but it was a well a heated discussion an it wasn easy ter block it out .Well ?Harry urged him as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily .Well I jus heard Snape sayin Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he Snape didn wan ter do it anymore Do what ?I dunno Harry it sounded like Snape was feelin a bit overworked thas all anyway Dumbledore told him flat out hed agreed ter do it an that was all there was to it .Pretty firm with him .An then he said summat abou Snape makin investigations in his House in Slytherin .Well theres nothin strange abou that !Hagrid added hastily as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning .All the Heads o Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business Yeah but Dumbledore s not having rows with the rest of them is he ?said Harry .Look Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two .I know what yehre like abou Snape Harry an I don want yeh ter go readin more inter this than there is .Look out said Hermione tersely .They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner hunchbacked his jowls aquiver .Oho !he wheezed .Out of bed so late thisll mean detention !No it won Filch said Hagrid shortly .Theyre with me aren they ?And what difference does that make ?asked Filch obnoxiously .Im a ruddy teacher aren I yeh sneakin Squib !said Hagrid firing up at once .There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury Mrs Norris had arrived unseen and was twisting herself sinuously around Filchs skinny ankles .Get goin said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth .Harry did not need telling twice he and Hermione both hurried off Hagrids and Filchs raised voices echoed behind them as they ran .They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling cackling and calling When theres strife and when theres trouble Call on Peevsie hell make double !The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room .It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet Harry was very relieved He had been interrogated enough that day .Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls dormitory .Harry however remained behind taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers .So Dumbledore had argued with Snape .In spite of all he had told Harry in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely he had lost his temper with him .He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins .or perhaps to investigate a single Slytherin Malfoy ?Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish to take matters into his own hands that he had pretended there was nothing in Harrys suspicions ?That seemed likely .It might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons or from procuring that memory from Slughorn .Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen yearolds .There you are Potter !Harry jumped to his feet in shock his wand at the ready .He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair .A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen .Ive been waiting for you to come back said McLaggen disregarding Harrys drawn wand .Mustve fallen asleep .Look I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier .Didnt look like hell be fit for next weeks match .It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about .Oh .right .Quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair .Yeah .he might not make it .Well then Ill be playing Keeper wont I ?said McLaggen .Yeah said Harry .Yeah I suppose so .He could not think of an argument against it after all McLaggen had certainly performed secondbest in the trials .Excellent said McLaggen in a satisfied voice .So whens practice ?What ?Oh .theres one tomorrow evening .Good .Listen Potter we should have a talk beforehand .Ive got some ideas on strategy you might find useful .Right said Harry unenthusiastically .Well Ill hear them tomorrow then .Im pretty tired now .see you The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day but it did not cause the sensation that Katies attack had done .People seemed to think that it might have been an accident given that he had been in the Potions masters room at the time and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done .In fact the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin .Harry however had never been less interested in Quidditch he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy .Still checking the Marauders Map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary .And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map .But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem what with Quidditch practice homework and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown .He could not decide which of them was more annoying .McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain .Meanwhile Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggens Quidditch lectures .At first Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing I mean I am his girlfriend !but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of indepth chats with him about Rons feelings a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone .Look why dont you talk to Ron about all this ?Harry asked after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be serious .Well I would but hes always asleep when I go and see him !said Lavender fretfully .Is he ?said Harry surprised for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snapes row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible .Is Hermione Granger still visiting him ?Lavender demanded suddenly .Yeah I think so .Well theyre friends arent they ?said Harry uncomfortably .Friends dont make me laugh said Lavender scornfully .She didnt talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me !But I suppose she wants to make up with him now hes all interesting .Would you call getting poisoned being interesting ?asked Harry .Anyway sorry got to go theres McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch said Harry hurriedly and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where thankfully neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him .On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch .Ron was very agitated Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match feeling it would overexcite him .So hows McLaggen shaping up ?he asked Harry nervously apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice .Ive told you said Harry patiently he could be worldclass and I wouldnt want to keep him .He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us .I cant wait to be shot of him .And speaking of getting shot of people Harry added getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you ?Shes driving me mad as well .Oh said Ron looking sheepish .Yeah .All right .If you dont want to go out with her anymore just tell her said Harry .Yeah .well .its not that easy is it ?said Ron .He paused .Hermione going to look in before the match ?he added casually .No shes already gone down to the pitch with Ginny .Oh said Ron looking rather glum .Right .Well good luck .Hope you hammer McLag I mean Smith .Ill try said Harry shouldering his broom .See you after the match .He hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it .He was looking out of the windows he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him accompanied by two girls both of whom looked sulky and resentful .Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry then gave a short humorless laugh and continued walking .Where re you going ?Harry demanded .Yeah Im really going to tell you because its your business Potter sneered Malfoy .Youd better hurry up theyll be waiting for ‘the Chosen Captain ‘the Boy Who Scored whatever they call you these days .One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle .Harry stared at her .She blushed .Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot turning the corner and vanishing from view .Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear .This was infuriating he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy skulking off while the rest of the school was absent Harrys best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to .The silent seconds trickled past and Harry remained where he was frozen gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished .Where have you been ?demanded Ginny as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms .The whole team was changed and ready Coote and Peakes the Beaters were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs .I met Malfoy Harry told her quietly as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head .So ?So I wanted to know how come hes up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here .Does it matter right now ?Well Im not likely to find out am I ?said Harry seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight .Come on then !And without another word he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos .There was little wind the clouds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight .Tricky conditions !McLaggen said bracingly to the team .Coote Peakes youll want to fly out of the sun so they dont see you coming Im the Captain McLaggen shut up giving them instructions said Harry angrily .Just get up by the goal posts !Once McLaggen had marched off Harry turned to Coote and Peakes .Make sure you do fly out of the sun he told them grudgingly .He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain and then on Madam Hoochs whistle kicked off and rose into the air higher than the rest of his team streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch .If he could catch it good and early there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle seize the Marauders Map and find out what Malfoy was doing .And thats Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle said a dreamy voice echoing over the grounds .He did the commentary last time of course and Ginny Weasley flew into him I think probably on purpose it looked like it .Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor I expect he regrets that now hes playing them oh look hes lost the Quaffle Ginny took it from him I do like her shes very nice .Harry stared down at the commentators podium .Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate ?But even from above there was no mistaking that long dirtyblonde hair nor the necklace of butterbeer corks .Beside Luna Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment . .but now that big Hufflepuff players got the Quaffle from her I cant remember his name its something like Bibble no Buggins Its Cadwallader !said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna .The crowd laughed .Harry stared around for the Snitch there was no sign of it .Moments later Cadwallader scored .McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear .McLaggen will you pay attention to what youre supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone !bellowed Harry wheeling around to face his Keeper .Youre not setting a great example !McLaggen shouted back redfaced and furious .And Harry Potters now having an argument with his Keeper said Luna serenely while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered .I dont think thatll help him find the Snitch but maybe its a clever ruse .Swearing angrily Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball .Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece giving the redandgoldclad supporters below something to cheer about .Then Cadwallader scored again making things level but Luna did not seem to have noticed she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score and kept attempting to draw the crowds attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute was suffering from something called Losers Lurgy .Seventyforty to Hufflepuff !barked Professor McGonagall into Lunas megaphone .Is it already ?said Luna vaguely .Oh look !The Gryffindor Keepers got hold of one of the Beaters bats .Harry spun around in midair .Sure enough McLaggen for reasons best known to himself had pulled Peakes s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader .Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts !roared Harry pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it .A blinding sickening pain .a flash of light .distant screams .and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel .And the next thing Harry knew he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling .He raised his head awkwardly .There on his left was a familiarlooking freckly redhaired person .Nice of you to drop in said Ron grinning .Harry blinked and looked around .Of course He was in the hospital wing .The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson .The match must have finished hours ago .as had any hope of cornering Malfoy .Harrys head felt strangely heavy he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages .What happened ?Cracked skull said Madam Pomfrey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows .Nothing to worry about I mended it at once but Im keeping you in overnight .You shouldnt overexert yourself for a few hours .I dont want to stay here overnight said Harry angrily sitting up and throwing back his covers .I want to find McLaggen and kill him .Im afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexertion said Madam Pomfrey pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner .You will stay here until I discharge you Potter or I shall call the headmaster .She bustled back into her office and Harry sank back into his pillows fuming .Dyou know how much we lost by ?he asked Ron through clenched teeth .Well yeah I do said Ron apologetically .Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty .Brilliant said Harry savagely .Really brilliant !When I get hold of McLaggen You dont want to get hold of him hes the size of a troll said Ron reasonably .Personally I think theres a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Princes .Anyway the rest of the team mightve dealt with him before you get out of here theyre not happy .There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly .Harry lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging .I could hear the match commentary from here said Ron his voice now shaking with laughter .I hope Luna always commentates from now on .Losers Lurgy .But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation and after a while Rons snorts subsided .Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious he said after a long pause and Harrys imagination zoomed into overdrive rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny weeping over his lifeless form confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing .She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match .How come ?You left here early enough .Oh .said Harry as the scene in his minds eye imploded .Yeah .well I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didnt look like they wanted to be with him and thats the second time hes made sure he isnt down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school he skipped the last match too remember ?Harry sighed .Wish Id followed him now the match was such a fiasco .Dont be stupid said Ron sharply .You couldnt have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy youre the Captain !I want to know what hes up to said Harry .And dont tell me its all in my head not after what I overheard between him and Snape I never said it was all in your head said Ron hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Harry but theres no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place !Youre getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy Harry .I mean thinking about missing a match just to follow him .I want to catch him at it !said Harry in frustration .I mean wheres he going when he disappears off the map ?I dunno .Hogsmeade ?suggested Ron yawning .Ive never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map .I thought they were being watched now anyway ?Well then I dunno said Ron .Silence fell between them .Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him thinking .If only he had Rufus Scrimgeours power he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command .He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the D .A .but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons most of them after all still had full schedules .There was a low rumbling snore from Rons bed .After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown .It was easiest to feign sleep Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand .The lamps dimmed and she returned to her office he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed .This was Harry reflected in the darkness the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury .Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch and the time before that all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart .That had been his most painful injury by far .he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the Harry sat bolt upright his heart pounding his bandage turban askew .He had the solution at last There was a way to have Malfoy followed how could he have forgotten why hadnt he thought of it before ?But the question was how to call him ?What did you do ?Quietly tentatively Harry spoke into the darkness .Kreacher ?There was a very loud crack and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room .Ron awoke with a yelp .Whats going ?Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfreys office and muttered MuffliatoV so that she would not come running .Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on .Two houseelves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats the other a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth .Then there was another loud bang and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves .I was watching that Potty !he told Harry indignantly pointing at the fight below before letting out a loud cackle .Look at the ickle creatures squabbling bitey bitey punchy punchy Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby no he wont or Dobby will shut Kreachers mouth for him !cried Dobby in a highpitched voice .kicky scratchy !cried Peeves happily now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further .Tweaky pokey !Kreacher will say what he likes about his master oh yes and what a master he is filthy friend of Mudbloods oh what would poor Kreachers mistress say ?Exactly what Kreachers mistress would have said they did not find out for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreachers mouth and knocked out half of his teeth .Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart though they continued to try and kick and punch each other egged on by Peeves who swooped around the lamp squealing Stick your fingers up his nosey draw his cork and pull his earsies Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said Langlockl Peeves clutched at his throat gulped then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth .Nice one said Ron appreciatively lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher .That was another Prince hex wasnt it ?Yeah said Harry twisting Kreachers wizened arm into a half nelson .Right Im forbidding you to fight each other !Well Kreacher youre forbidden to fight Dobby .Dobby I know Im not allowed to give you orders Dobby is a free houseelf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do !said Dobby tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper .Okay then said Harry and he and Ron both released the elves who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting .Master called me ?croaked Kreacher sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death .Yeah I did said Harry glancing toward Madam Pomfreys office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion .Ive got a job for you .Kreacher will do whatever Master wants said Kreacher sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes because Kreacher has no choice but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master yes Dobby will do it Harry Potter !squeaked Dobby his tennisballsized eyes still swimming in tears .Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter !Come to think of it it would be good to have both of you said Harry .Okay then .I want you to tail Draco Malfoy .Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Rons face Harry went on I want to know where hes going who hes meeting and what hes doing .I want you to follow him around the clock .Yes Harry Potter !said Dobby at once his great eyes shining with excitement .And if Dobby does it wrong Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower Harry Potter !There wont be any need for that said Harry hastily .Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys ?croaked Kreacher .Master wants me to spy upon the pureblood greatnephew of my old mistress ?Thats the one said Harry foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately .And youre forbidden to tip him off Kreacher or to show him what youre up to or to talk to him at all or to write him messages or .or to contact him in any way .Got it ?He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited .After a moment or two and to Harrys great satisfaction Kreacher bowed deeply again and said with bitter resentment Master thinks of everything and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy oh yes .Thats settled then said Harry .Ill want regular reports but make sure Im not surrounded by people when you turn up .Ron and Hermione are okay .And dont tell anyone what youre doing .Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters .LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST Harry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again .Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean .The drowsing creature in Harrys chest suddenly raised its head sniffing the air hopefully .What did they row about ?he asked trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventhfloor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus .She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying .Its all right !said Hermione kindly hurrying forward to help her .Here .She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said Reparo .The girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight Ron glanced back at her .I swear theyre getting smaller he said .Never mind her said Harry a little impatiently .What did Ginny and Dean row about Hermione ?Oh Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you said Hermione .It mustve looked funny said Ron reasonably .It didnt look funny at all !said Hermione hotly .It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadnt caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt !Yeah well there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it said Harry still trying to sound casual .Or are they still together ?Yes they are but why are you so interested ?asked Hermione giving Harry a sharp look .I just dont want my Quidditch team messed up again !he said hastily but Hermione continued to look suspicious and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called Harry !giving him an excuse to turn his back on her .Oh hi Luna .I went to the hospital wing to find you said Luna rummaging in her bag .But they said youd left .She thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Rons hands finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry . .Ive been told to give you this .It was a small roll of parchment which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore .Tonight he told Ron and Hermione once he had unrolled it .Nice commentary last match !said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter .Luna smiled vaguely .Youre making fun of me arent you ?she said .Everyone says I was dreadful .No Im serious !said Ron earnestly .I cant remember enjoying commentary more !What is this by the way ?he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level .Oh its a Gurdyroot she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag .You can keep it if you like Ive got a few of them .Theyre really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies .And she walked away leaving Ron chortling still clutching the Gurdyroot .You know shes grown on me Luna he said as they set off again for the Great Hall .I know shes insane but its in a good He stopped talking very suddenly .Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous .Hi said Ron nervously .Cmon Harry muttered to Hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard Lavender say Why didnt you tell me you were getting out today ?And why was she with you ?Ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and though he sat with Lavender Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together .Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face .All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other words finish writing Harrys Herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work .Thanks a lot Hermione said Harry giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight oclock .Listen Ive got to hurry or Ill be late for Dumbledore .She did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way .Grinning Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office .The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclairs and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight .Enter called Dumbledore but as Harry put out a hand to push the door it was wrenched open from inside .There stood Professor Trelawney .Aha !she cried pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles .So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office Dumbledore !My dear Sybill said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but Harry does have an appointment and I really dont think there is any more to be said Very well said Professor Trelawney in a deeply wounded voice .If you will not banish the usurping nag so be it .Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated .She pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls .Please close the door and sit down Harry said Dumbledore sounding rather tired .Harry obeyed noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory .Professor Trelawney still isnt happy Firenze is teaching then ?Harry asked .No said Dumbledore Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself .I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave .Between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle .She does not know and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort you see .Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said But never mind my staffing problems .We have much more important matters to discuss .Firstly have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson ?Ah said Harry brought up short .What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn .Well I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions sir but er he wouldnt give it to me .There was a little silence .I see said Dumbledore eventually peering at Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being Xrayed .And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter do you ?That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity ?That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory ?Well Harry stalled at a loss for what to say next .His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble .Well .the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn .I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood And did that work ?asked Dumbledore .Well no sir because Ron got poisoned which naturally made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory I would have expected nothing else while your best friend was in danger .Once it became clear that Mr Weasley was going to make a full recovery however I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you .I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is .Indeed I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it .A hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harrys head all the way down his body .Dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound angry but Harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappointment was worse than anything .Sir he said a little desperately it isnt that I wasnt bothered or anything Ive just had other other things .Other things on your mind Dumbledore finished the sentence for him .I see .Silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore s head .Harry felt strangely diminished as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room .When he could stand it no longer he said Professor Dumbledore Im really sorry .I should have done more .I should have realized you wouldnt have asked me to do it if it wasnt really important .Thank you for saying that Harry said Dumbledore quietly .May I hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on ?There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory .Ill do it sir Ill get it from him he said earnestly .Then we shall say no more about it just now said Dumbledore more kindly but continue with our story where we left off .You remember where that was ?Yes sir said Harry quickly .Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it .Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked .he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes he mumbled shamefacedly .Very good said Dumbledore .Now you will remember I hope that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation ?Yes sir .Thus far as I hope you agree I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen ?Harry nodded .But now Harry said Dumbledore now things become murkier and stranger .If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort .In fact I doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from himself who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts .However I have two last memories that I would like to share with you .Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve .I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely .The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it .I hope you are not tired of diving into other peoples memories for they are curious recollections these two he said .This first one came from a very old houseelf by the name of Hokey .Before we see what Hokey witnessed I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts .He reached the seventh year of his schooling with as you might have expected top grades in every examination he had taken .All around him his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts .Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle prefect Head Boy winner of the Award for Special Services to the School .I know that several teachers Professor Slughorn amongst them suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic offered to set up appointments put him in touch with useful contacts .He refused all offers .The next thing the staff knew Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes .At Borgin and Burkes ?Harry repeated stunned .At Borgin and Burkes repeated Dumbledore calmly .I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokeys memory .But this was not Voldemorts first choice of job .Hardly anyone knew of it at the time I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher .He wanted to stay here ?Why ?asked Harry more amazed still .I believe he had several reasons though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet said Dumbledore .Firstly and very importantly Voldemort was I believe more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person .Hogwarts was where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home .Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too .Secondly the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic .Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel stores of magic to tap .And thirdly as a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards .Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn the teacher with whom he was on best terms who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play .I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an army .But he didnt get the job sir ?No he did not .Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few years if he still wished to teach .How did you feel about that sir ?asked Harry hesitantly .Deeply uneasy said Dumbledore .I had advised Armando against the appointment I did not give the reasons I have given you for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty .But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power .Which job did he want sir ?What subject did he want to teach ?Somehow Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it .Defense Against the Dark Arts .It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years .So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop .However Voldemort was no mere assistant .Polite and handsome and clever he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes which specializes as you know Harry in objects with unusual and powerful properties .Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusually gifted at doing this .Ill bet he was said Harry unable to contain himself .Well quite said Dumbledore with a faint smile .And now it is time to hear from Hokey the houseelf who worked for a very old very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith .Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve saying as he did so After you Harry .Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them .He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake .She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest house elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers .Hurry up Hokey !said Hepzibah imperiously .He said hed come at four its only a couple of minutes to and hes never been late yet !She tucked away her powder puff as the houseelf straightened up .The top of the elfs head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah s chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga .How do I look ?said Hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror .Lovely madam squeaked Hokey .Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokeys contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion .A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped .Quick quick hes here Hokey !cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes cases full of goldembossed books shelves of orbs and celestial globes and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers .In fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory .The houseelf returned within minutes followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort .He was plainly dressed in a black suit his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed but all of this suited him he looked more handsome than ever .He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah s fat little hand brushing it with his lips .I brought you flowers he said quietly producing a bunch of roses from nowhere .You naughty boy you shouldnt have !squealed old Hepzibah though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table .You do spoil this old lady Tom .Sit down sit down .Wheres Hokey ?Ah .The houseelf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her mistresss elbow .Help yourself Tom said Hepzibah I know how you love my cakes .Now how are you ?You look pale .They overwork you at that shop Ive said it a hundred times .Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered .Well whats your excuse for visiting this time ?she asked batting her lashes .Mr Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblinmade armor said Voldemort .Five hundred Galleons he feels it is a more than fair Now now not so fast or Ill think youre only here for my trinkets !pouted Hepzibah .I am ordered here because of them said Voldemort quietly .I am only a poor assistant madam who must do as he is told .Mr Burke wishes me to inquire Oh Mr Burke phooey !said Hepzibah waving a little hand .Ive something to show you that Ive never shown Mr Burke !Can you keep a secret Tom ?Will you promise you wont tell Mr Burke Ive got it ?Hed never let me rest if he knew Id shown it to you and Im not selling not to Burke not to anyone !But you Tom youll appreciate it for its history not how many Galleons you can get for it .Id be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me said Voldemort quietly and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle .I had Hokey bring it out for me .Hokey where are you ?I want to show Mr Riddle our finest treasure .In fact bring both while youre at it .Here madam squeaked the houseelf and Harry saw two leather boxes one on top of the other moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables pouffes and footstools .Now said Hepzibah happily taking the boxes from the elf laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one I think youll like this Tom .Oh if my family knew I was showing you .They cant wait to get their hands on this !She opened the lid .Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles .I wonder whether you know what it is Tom ?Pick it up have a good look !whispered Hepzibah and Voldemort stretched out a longfingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings .Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes .His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibahs face except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemorts handsome features .A badger murmured Voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup .Then this was . ?Helga Hufflepuffs as you very well know you clever boy !said Hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek .Didnt I tell you I was distantly descended ?This has been handed down in the family for years and years .Lovely isnt it ?And all sorts of powers its supposed to possess too but I havent tested them thoroughly I just keep it nice and safe in here .She hooked the cup back off Voldemorts long forefinger and restored it gently to its box too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemorts face as the cup was taken away .Now then said Hepzibah happily wheres Hokey ?Oh yes there you are take that away now Hokey .The elf obediently took the boxed cup and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap .I think youll like this even more Tom she whispered .Lean in a little dear boy so you can see . .Of course Burke knows Ive got this one I bought it from him and I daresay hed love to get it back when Im gone .She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box .There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket .Voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it .Slytherins mark he said quietly as the light played upon an ornate serpentine S .Thats right !said Hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed .I had to pay an arm and a leg for it but I couldnt let it pass not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection .Burke bought it apparently from a raggedlooking woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of its true value There was no mistaking it this time Voldemorts eyes flashed scarlet at the words and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the lockets chain .I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are .Pretty isnt it ?And again all kinds of powers attributed to it though I just keep it nice and safe .She reached out to take the locket back .For a moment Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion .So there you are Tom dear and I hope you enjoyed that !She looked him full in the face and for the first time Harry saw her foolish smile falter .Are you all right dear ?Oh yes said Voldemort quietly .Yes Im very well .I thought but a trick of the light I suppose said Hepzibah looking unnerved and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemorts eyes .Here Hokey take these away and lock them up again .The usual enchantments .Time to leave Harry said Dumbledore quietly and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore s office .Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene said Dumbledore resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same .Hokey the houseelf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistresss evening cocoa by accident .No way !said Harry angrily .I see we are of one mind said Dumbledore .Certainly there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles .In both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death Hokey confessed ?She remembered putting something in her mistresss cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and littleknown poison said Dumbledore .It was concluded that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused Voldemort modified her memory just like he did with Morfin !Yes that is my conclusion too said Dumbledore .And just as with Morfin the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey because she was a houseelf said Harry .He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up S .P .E .W .Precisely said Dumbledore .She was old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further .As in the case of Morfin by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory her life was almost over but her memory of course proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket .By the time Hokey was convicted Hepzibahs family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing .It took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding places having always guarded her collection most jealously .But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished .His superiors had no idea where he had gone they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance .And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time .Now said Dumbledore if you dont mind Harry I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story .Voldemort had committed another murder whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles I do not know but I think it was .This time as you will have seen he killed not for revenge but for gain .He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor besotted old woman showed him .Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin s ring so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket .But said Harry frowning it seems mad .Risking everything throwing away his job just for those .Mad to you perhaps but not to Voldemort said Dumbledore .I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him Harry but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least as rightfully his .The locket maybe said Harry but why take the cup as well ?It had belonged to another of Hogwartss founders said Dumbledore .I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history .There were other reasons I think .I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course .And now for the very last recollection I have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorns memory for us .Ten years separates Hokeys memory and this one ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing .Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve .Whose memory is it ?he asked .Mine said Dumbledore .And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left .There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk was Dumbledore who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was perhaps a little less lined .The one difference between the presentday office and this one was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge .The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moments after their arrival there was a knock on the door and he said Enter .Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp .Voldemort had entered the room .His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago They were not as snakelike the eyes were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle .It was as though his features had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become .He was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders .The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise .Evidently this visit had been made by appointment .Good evening Tom said Dumbledore easily .Wont you sit down ?Thank you said Voldemort and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured the very seat by the looks of it that Harry had just vacated in the present .I heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been .A worthy choice .I am glad you approve said Dumbledore smiling .May I offer you a drink ?That would be welcome said Voldemort .I have come a long way .Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve but which then was full of bottles .Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk .So Tom .to what do I owe the pleasure ?Voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine .They do not call me Tom anymore he said .These days I am known as I know what you are known as said Dumbledore smiling pleasantly .But to me Im afraid you will always be Tom Riddle .It is one of the irritating things about old teachers .I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges youthful beginnings .He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort whose face remained expressionless .Nevertheless Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly Dumbledores refusal to use Voldemorts chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such .I am surprised you have remained here so long said Voldemort after a short pause .I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school .Well said Dumbledore still smiling to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills helping hone young minds .If I remember correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too .I see it still said Voldemort .I merely wondered why you who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry and who have twice I think been offered the post of Minister Three times at the last count actually said Dumbledore .But the Ministry never attracted me as a career .Again something we have in common I think .Voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine .Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for Voldemort to talk first .I have returned he said after a little while later perhaps than Professor Dippet expected .but I have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me I was too young to have .I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach .I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place .I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard .Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking .Yes I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us he said quietly .Rumors of your doings have reached your old school Tom .I should be sorry to believe half of them .Voldemort s expression remained impassive as he said Greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawns lies .You must know this Dumbledore .You call it ‘greatness what you have been doing do you ?asked Dumbledore delicately .Certainly said Voldemort and his eyes seemed to burn red .I have experimented I have pushed the boundaries of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed Of some kinds of magic Dumbledore corrected him quietly .Of some .Of others you remain .forgive me .woefully ignorant .For the first time Voldemort smiled .It was a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage .The old argument he said softly .But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic Dumbledore .Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places suggested Dumbledore .Well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at Hogwarts ?said Voldemort .Will you let me return ?Will you let me share my knowledge with your students ?I place myself and my talents at your disposal .I am yours to command .Dumbledore raised his eyebrows .And what will become of those whom you command ?What will happen to those who call themselves or so rumor has it the Death Eaters ?Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name he saw Voldemorts eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare .My friends he said after a moments pause will carry on without me I am sure .I am glad to hear that you consider them friends said Dumbledore .I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants .You are mistaken said Voldemort .Then if I were to go to the Hogs Head tonight I would not find a group of them Nott Rosier Mulciber Dolohov awaiting your return ?Devoted friends indeed to travel this far with you on a snowy night merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post .There could be no doubt that Dumbledore s detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort however he rallied almost at once .You are omniscient as ever Dumbledore .Oh no merely friendly with the local barmen said Dumbledore lightly .Now Tom .Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture .Let us speak openly .Why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want ?Voldemort looked coldly surprised .A job I do not want ?On the contrary Dumbledore I want it very much .Oh you want to come back to Hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen .What is it youre after Tom ?Why not try an open request for once ?Voldemort sneered .If you do not want to give me a job Of course I dont said Dumbledore .And I dont think for a moment you expected me to .Nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose .Voldemort stood up .He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever his features thick with rage .This is your final word ?It is said Dumbledore also standing .Then we have nothing more to say to each other .No nothing said Dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face .The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes .But I wish I could Tom .I wish I could .For a second Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning He was sure that Voldemorts hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed Voldemort had turned away the door was closing and he was gone .Harry felt Dumbledore s hand close over his arm again and moments later they were standing together on almost the same spot but there was no snow building on the window ledge and Dumbledores hand was blackened and deadlooking once more .Why ?said Harry at once looking up into Dumbledores face .Why did he come back ?Did you ever find out ?I have ideas said Dumbledore but no more than that .What ideas sir ?I shall tell you Harry when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn said Dumbledore .When you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will I hope be clear .to both of us .Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him he did not move at once .Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again sir ?He didnt say .Oh he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job said Dumbledore .The aftermath of our little meeting proved that .You see we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort .THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss poring over his Potions book hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin as he had done so many times before .You wont find anything in there said Hermione firmly late on Sunday evening .Dont start Hermione said Harry .If it hadnt been for the Prince Ron wouldnt be sitting here now .He would if youd just listened to Snape in our first year said Hermione dismissively .Harry ignored her .He had just found an incantation Sectumsempral scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words For Enemies and was itching to try it out but thought it best not to in front of Hermione .Instead he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page .They were sitting beside the fire in the common room the only other people awake were fellow sixth years .There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test .Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date the twentyfirst of April had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions which would take place heavily supervised in Hogsmeade .Ron had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test .Hermione who had now achieved Apparition twice was a little more confident but Harry who would not be seventeen for another four months could not take the test whether ready or not .At least you can Apparate though !said Ron tensely .Youll have no trouble come July !Ive only done it once Harry reminded him he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson .Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed .Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors but he did not care Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now . ‘Tm telling you the stupid Prince isnt going to be able to help you with this Harry !said Hermione more loudly .Theres only one way to force someone to do what you want and thats the Imperius Curse which is illegal Yeah I know that thanks said Harry not looking up from the book .Thats why Im looking for something different .Dumbledore says Veritaserum wont do it but there might be something else a potion or a spell .Youre going about it the wrong way said Hermione .Only you can get the memory Dumbledore says .That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people cant .Its not a question of slipping him a potion anyone could do that How dyou spell ‘belligerent ?said Ron shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment .It cant be B U M No it isnt said Hermione pulling Rons essay toward her .And ‘augury doesnt begin O R G either .What kind of quill are you using ?Its one of Fred and Georges SpellCheck ones .but I think the charm must be wearing off .Yes it must said Hermione pointing at the title of his essay because we were asked how wed deal with dementors not ‘Dugbogs and I dont remember you changing your name to ‘Roonil Wazlib either .Ah no !said Ron staring horrorstruck at the parchment .Dont say Ill have to write the whole thing out again !Its okay we can fix it said Hermione pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand .I love you Hermione said Ron sinking back in his chair rubbing his eyes wearily .Hermione turned faintly pink but merely said Dont let Lavender hear you saying that .I wont said Ron into his hands .Or maybe I will .then shell ditch me .Why dont you ditch her if you want to finish it ?asked Harry .You havent ever chucked anyone have you ?said Ron .You and Cho just Sort of fell apart yeah said Harry Wish that would happen with me and Lavender said Ron gloomily watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand so that they corrected themselves on the page .But the more I hint I want to finish it the tighter she holds on .Its like going out with the giant squid .There said Hermione some twenty minutes later handing back Rons essay .Thanks a million said Ron .Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion ?Harry who had found nothing useful in the Half Blood Princes notes so far looked around the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay .The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermiones quill .Harry had just closed the HalfBlood Princes book yawning when Crack .Hermione let out a little shriek Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and Harry said Kreacher !The houseelf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes .Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing so Kreacher has come to give Crack .Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher his teacozy hat askew .Dobby has been helping too Harry Potter !he squeaked casting Kreacher a resentful look .And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together !What is this ?asked Hermione still looking shocked by these sudden appearances .Whats going on Harry ?Harry hesitated before answering because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy houseelves were always such a touchy subject with her .Well .theyve been following Malfoy for me he said .Night and day croaked Kreacher .Dobby has not slept for a week Harry Potter !said Dobby proudly swaying where he stood .Hermione looked indignant .You havent slept Dobby ?But surely Harry you didnt tell him not to No of course I didnt said Harry quickly .Dobby you can sleep all right ?But has either of you found out anything ?he hastened to ask before Hermione could intervene again .Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood croaked Kreacher at once .His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of Draco Malfoy is a bad boy !squeaked Dobby angrily .A bad boy who who He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire as though about to dive into it Harry to whom this was not entirely unexpected caught him around the middle and held him fast .For a few seconds Dobby struggled then went limp .Thank you Harry Potter he panted .Dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters .Harry released him Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a houseelf !Yeah we dont need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy Harry told Kreacher .Lets fast forward to where hes actually been going .Kreacher bowed again looking furious and then said Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons he attends his classes in a variety of Dobby you tell me said Harry cutting across Kreacher .Has he been going anywhere he shouldnt have ?Harry Potter sir squeaked Dobby his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover but he is still keen to avoid detection .He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students who keep watch for him while he enters The Room of Requirement !said Harry smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion Making .Hermione and Ron stared at him .Thats where hes been sneaking off to !Thats where hes doing .whatever hes doing !And I bet thats why hes been disappearing off the map come to think of it Ive never seen the Room of Requirement on there !Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there said Ron .I think itll be part of the magic of the room said Hermione .If you need it to be Unplottable it will be .Dobby have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoys doing ?said Harry eagerly .No Harry Potter that is impossible said Dobby .No its not said Harry at once .Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year so Ill be able to get in and spy on him no problem .But I dont think you will Harry said Hermione slowly .Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room didnt he because that stupid Marietta had blabbed .He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D .A .so it did .But you dont know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there so you dont know what to ask it to transform into .Therell be a way around that said Harry dismissively .Youve done brilliantly Dobby .Kreachers done well too said Hermione kindly but far from looking grateful Kreacher averted his huge bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear Get out of it Harry snapped at him and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated .Youd better go and get some sleep too Dobby .Thank you Harry Potter sir !squeaked Dobby happily and he too vanished .How goods this ?said Harry enthusiastically turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elffree again .We know where Malfoys going !Weve got him cornered now !Yeah its great said Ron glumly who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay .Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand .But whats all this about him going up there with a Variety of students ?said Hermione .How many people are in on it ?You wouldnt think hed trust lots of them to know what hes doing .Yeah that is weird said Harry frowning .I heard him telling Crabbe it wasnt Crabbes business what he was doing .so whats he telling all these .all these .Harrys voice tailed away he was staring at the fire .God Ive been stupid he said quietly .Its obvious isnt it ?There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon .He couldve nicked some any time during that lesson .Nicked what ?said Ron .Polyjuice Potion .He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson .There arent a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy .its just Crabbe and Goyle as usual .Yeah it all fits !said Harry jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire .Theyre stupid enough to do what theyre told even if he wont tell them what hes up to .but he doesnt want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement so hes got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people .Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch ha !Crabbe and Goyle !Do you mean to say said Hermione in a hushed voice that that little girl whose scales I repaired ?Yeah of course !said Harry loudly staring at her .Of course !Malfoy mustve been inside the room at the time so she what am I talking about ?he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out because there was someone there !And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too !Weve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it !Hes got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls ?guffawed Ron .Blimey .No wonder they dont look too happy these days .Im surprised they dont tell him to stuff it .Well they wouldnt would they if hes shown them his Dark Mark ?said Harry .Hmmm .the Dark Mark we dont know exists said Hermione skeptically rolling up Rons dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him .Well see said Harry confidently .Yes we will Hermione said getting to her feet and stretching .But Harry before you get all excited I still dont think youll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing whats there first .And I dont think you should forget she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look that what youre supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn .Good night .Harry watched her go feeling slightly disgruntled .Once the door to the girls dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron .What dyou think ?Wish I could Disapparate like a houseelf said Ron staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished .Id have that Apparition Test in the bag .Harry did not sleep well that night .He lay awake for what felt like hours wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he Harry would see when he went in there the following day for whatever Hermione said Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the D .A .he would be able to see Malfoy s .what could it be ?A meeting place ?A hideout ?A storeroom ?A workshop ?Harrys mind worked feverishly and his dreams when he finally fell asleep were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy who turned into Slughorn who turned into Snape .Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement .Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room which irritated Harry because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to .Look he said quietly leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet which she had just removed from a post owl to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it .I havent forgotten about Slughorn but I havent got a clue how to get that memory off him and until I get a brain wave why shouldnt I find out what Malfoys doing ?Ive already told you you need to persuade Slughorn said Hermione .Its not a question of tricking him or bewitching him or Dumbledore could have done it in a second .Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature .Anyone we know ?asked Ron as Hermione scanned the headlines .Yes !said Hermione causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast .But its all right hes not dead its Mundungus hes been arrested and sent to Azkaban !Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary .and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished .Oh and how horrible a nineyearold boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents they think he was under the Imperius Curse .They finished their breakfast in silence .Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes Ron for the common room where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snapes dementor essay and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet .Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage but he need not have bothered .When he reached his destination he found it deserted .Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an elevenyearold girl .He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirements door was concealed .He knew what he had to do he had become most accomplished at it last year .Concentrating with all his might he thought I need to see what Malfoy s doing in here .I need to see what Malfoys doing in here .I need to see what Malfoys doing in here .Three times he walked past the door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eyes and faced it But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall .He moved forward and gave it an experimental push .The stone remained solid and unyielding .Okay said Harry aloud .Okay .I thought the wrong thing .He pondered for a moment then set off again eyes closed concentrating as hard as he could .I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly .I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly .After three walks past he opened his eyes expectantly .There was no door .Oh come off it he told the wall irritably .That was a clear instruction .Fine .He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more .I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy .He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling he was listening hard as though he might hear the door pop into existence .He heard nothing however except the distant twittering of birds outside .He opened his eyes .There was still no door .Harry swore .Someone screamed .He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost .Harry tried every variation of I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you that he could think of for a whole hour at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point The room simply did not want to open for him .Frustrated and annoyed he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went .Late again Potter said Snape coldly as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom .Ten points from Gryffindor .Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron half the class was still on its feet taking out books and organizing their things he could not be much later than any of them .Before we start I want your dementor essays said Snape waving his wand carelessly so that twenty five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk .And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse .Now if you will all open your books to page what is it Mr Finnigan ?Sir said Seamus Ive been wondering how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost ?Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius No there wasnt said Snape in a bored voice .But sir I heard people talking If you had actually read the article in question Mr Finnigan you would have known that the socalled Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher .I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione .Shouldnt he be upset Mundungus has been arrest But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject said Snape pointing suddenly at the back of the room his black eyes fixed on Harry Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost .The whole class looked around at Harry who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn .Er well ghosts are transparent he said .Oh very good interrupted Snape his lip curling .Yes it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you Potter . ‘Ghosts are transparent .Pansy Parkinson let out a highpitched giggle .Several other people were smirking .Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly though his insides were boiling Yeah ghosts are transparent but Inferi are dead bodies arent they ?So theyd be solid A fiveyearold could have told us as much sneered Snape .The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizards spells .It is not alive it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizards bidding .A ghost as I trust that you are all aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth .and of course as Potter so wisely tells us transparent .Well what Harry said is the most useful if were trying to tell them apart !said Ron .When we come facetoface with one down a dark alley were going to be having a shufti to see if its solid arent we were not going to be asking ‘Excuse me are you the imprint of a departed soul ?There was a ripple of laughter instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class .Another ten points from Gryffindor said Snape .I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you Ronald Weasley the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room .IVo !whispered Hermione grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously .Theres no point youll just end up in detention again leave it !Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen said Snape smirking a little and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse .Ron was very subdued all through the class .When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Rons Apparition but this seemed to merely irritate Ron and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys bathroom with Harry .Snapes right though isnt he ?said Ron after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two .I dunno whether its worth me taking the test .I just cant get the hang of Apparition .You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you said Harry reasonably .Itll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway .Then if youre still not you know as good as youd like to be you can postpone the test do it with me over the summ Myrtle this is the boys bathroom !The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glasses .Oh she said glumly .Its you two .Who were you expecting ?said Ron looking at her in the mirror .Nobody said Myrtle picking moodily at a spot on her chin .He said hed come back and see me but then you said youd pop in and visit me too she gave Harry a reproachful look and I havent seen you for months and months .Ive learned not to expect too much from boys .I thought you lived in that girls bathroom ?said Harry who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now .I do she said with a sulky little shrug but that doesnt mean I cant visit other places .I came and saw you in your bath once remember ?Vividly said Harry .But I thought he liked me she said plaintively .Maybe if you two left hed come back again .We had lots in common .Im sure he felt it .And she looked hopefully toward the door .When you say you had lots in common said Ron sounding rather amused now dyou mean he lives in an Sbend too ?No said Myrtle defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom .I mean hes sensitive people bully him too and he feels lonely and hasnt got anybody to talk to and hes not afraid to show his feelings and cry !Theres been a boy in here crying ?said Harry curiously .A young boy ?Never you mind !said Myrtle her small leaky eyes fixed on Ron who was now definitely grinning .I promised I wouldnt tell anyone and Ill take his secret to the not the grave surely ?said Ron with a snort .The sewers maybe .Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor .Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron .Youre right he said swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder Ill do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test .And so the following weekend Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight .Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village he missed making trips there and it was a particularly fine spring day one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time .However he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement .Youd do better said Hermione when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall to go straight to Slughorns office and try and get that memory from him .Ive been trying !said Harry crossly which was perfectly true .He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him .Twice Harry had gone to his office and knocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone .He doesnt want to talk to me Hermione !He can tell Ive been trying to get him on his own again and hes not going to let it happen !Well youve just got to keep at it havent you ?The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker .He wished Ron and Hermione both luck then turned and climbed the marble staircase again determined whatever Hermione said to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement .Once out of sight of the entrance hall Harry pulled the Marauders Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag .Having concealed himself he tapped the map murmured I solemnly swear that I am up to no good and scanned it carefully .As it was Sunday morning nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms the Gryffindors in one tower the Ravenclaws in another the Slytherins in the dungeons and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens .Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor .There were a few people out in the grounds .and there alone in the seventhfloor corridor was Gregory Goyle .There was no sign of the Room of Requirement but Harry was not worried about that if Goyle was standing guard outside it the room was open whether the map was aware of it or not .He therefore sprinted up the stairs slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor when he began to creep very slowly toward the very same little girl clutching her heavy brass scales that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before .He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering Hello .youre very pretty arent you ?Goyle gave a highpitched scream of terror threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor .Laughing Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which he was sure Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen aware that someone unwelcome was out there but not daring to make an appearance .It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried .Yet this hopeful mood did not last long .Half an hour later having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to the wall was just as doorless as ever .Harry felt frustrated beyond belief Malfoy might be just feet away from him and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there .Losing his patience completely Harry ran at the wall and kicked it .OUCH !He thought he might have broken his toe as he clutched it and hopped on one foot the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him .Harry ?He spun around onelegged and toppled over .There to his utter astonishment was Tonks walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor .Whatre you doing here ?he said scrambling to his feet again why did she always have to find him lying on the floor ?I came to see Dumbledore said Tonks .Harry thought she looked terrible thinner than usual her mousecolored hair lank .His office isnt here said Harry its round the other side of the castle behind the gargoyle I know said Tonks .Hes not there .Apparently hes gone away again .Has he ?said Harry putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor .Hey you dont know where he goes I suppose ?No said Tonks .What did you want to see him about ?Nothing in particular said Tonks picking apparently unconsciously at the sleeve of her robe .I just thought he might know whats going on .Ive heard rumors .people getting hurt .Yeah I know its all been in the papers said Harry .That little kid trying to kill his The Prophets often behind the times said Tonks who didnt seem to be listening to him .You havent had any letters from anyone in the Order recently ?No one from the Order writes to me anymore said Harry not since Sirius He saw that her eyes had filled with tears .Im sorry he muttered awkwardly .I mean .I miss him as well .What ?said Tonks blankly as though she had not heard him .Well .Ill see you around Harry .And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor leaving Harry to stare after her .After a minute or so he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement but his heart was not in it .Finally a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who hopefully would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come .He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall already halfway through an early lunch .I did it well kind of !Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him .I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit ended up near Scrivenshafts but at least I moved !Good one said Harry .Howd you do Hermione ?Oh she was perfect obviously said Ron before Hermione could answer .Perfect deliberation divination and desperation or whatever the hell it is we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you shouldve heard Twycross going on about her Ill be surprised if he doesnt pop the question soon And what about you ?asked Hermione ignoring Ron .Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time ?Yep said Harry .And guess who I ran into up there ?Tonks !Tonks ?repeated Ron and Hermione together looking surprised .Yeah she said shed come to visit Dumbledore .If you ask me said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks shes cracking up a bit .Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry .Its a bit odd said Hermione who for some reason looked very concerned .Shes supposed to be guarding the school whys she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when hes not even here ?I had a thought said Harry tentatively .He felt strange about voicing it this was much more Hermiones territory than his .You dont think she can have been .you know .in love with Sirius ?Hermione stared at him .What on earth makes you say that ?I dunno said Harry shrugging but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name .and her Patronus is a big fourlegged thing now .I wondered whether it hadnt become .you know .him .Its a thought said Hermione slowly .But I still dont know why shed be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore if thats really why she was here .Goes back to what I said doesnt it ?said Ron who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth .Shes gone a bit funny .Lost her nerve .Women he said wisely to Harry theyre easily upset .And yet said Hermione coming out of her reverie I doubt youd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didnt laugh at their joke about the hag the Healer and the Mimbulus mimbletonia .Ron scowled .AFTER THE BURIAL Patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harrys mood .He had been thwarted both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead somehow to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades .For the last time just forget about Malfoy Hermione told Harry firmly .They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch .Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them for they were taking their tests that very afternoon but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves .Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner .It isnt Lavender said Hermione wearily .Oh good said Ron relaxing .Harry Potter ?said the girl .I was asked to give you this .Thanks .Harrys heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment .Once the girl was out of earshot he said Dumbledore said we wouldnt be having any more lessons until I got the memory !Maybe he wants to check on how youre doing ?suggested Hermione as Harry unrolled the parchment but rather than finding Dumbledore s long narrow slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run .Dear Harry Ron and Hermione Aragog died last night Harry and Ron you met him and you know how special he was .Hermione I know youd have liked him .It would mean a lot to me if youd nip down for the burial later this evening .Im planning on doing it round dusk that was his favorite time of day .I know youre not supposed to be out that late but you can use the cloak .Wouldnt ask but I cant face it alone .Hagrid Look at this said Harry handing the note to Hermione .Oh for heavens sake she said scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron who read it through looking increasingly incredulous .Hes mentaft he said furiously .That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me !Told them to help themselves !And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body !Its not just that said Hermione .Hes asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows securitys a million times tighter and how much trouble wed be in if we were caught .Weve been down to see him by night before said Harry .Yes but for something like this ?said Hermione .Weve risked a lot to help Hagrid out but after all Aragogs dead .If it were a question of saving him Id want to go even less said Ron firmly .You didnt meet him Hermione .Believe me being dead will have improved him a lot .Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it .Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment .Harry you cant be thinking of going said Hermione .Its such a pointless thing to get detention for .Harry sighed .Yeah I know he said .I spose Hagrid ll have to bury Aragog without us .Yes he will said Hermione looking relieved .Look Potions will be almost empty this afternoon with us all off doing our tests .Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then !Fiftyseventh time lucky you think ?said Harry bitterly .Lucky said Ron suddenly .Harry thats it get lucky !What dyou mean ?Use your lucky potion !Ron thats thats it !said Hermione sounding stunned .Of course !Why didnt I think of it ?Harry stared at them both .Felix Felicis ?he said .I dunno .I was sort of saving it .What for ?demanded Ron incredulously .What on earth is more important than this memory Harry ?asked Hermione .Harry did not answer .The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend had been fermenting in the depths of his brain unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking .Harry ?Are you still with us ?asked Hermione .Wha ?Yeah of course he said pulling himself together .Well .okay .If I cant get Slughorn to talk this afternoon Ill take some Felix and have another go this evening .Thats decided then said Hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette .Destination .determination .deliberation .she murmured .Oh stop that Ron begged her I feel sick enough as it is quick hide me !It isnt Lavender !said Hermione impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her .Cool said Ron peering over Hermiones shoulder to check .Blimey they dont look happy do they ?Theyre the Montgomery sisters and of course they dont look happy didnt you hear what happened to their little brother ?said Hermione .Im losing track of whats happening to everyones relatives to be honest said Ron .Well their brother was attacked by a werewolf .The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters .Anyway the boy was only five and he died in St .Mungos they couldnt save him .He died ?repeated Harry shocked .But surely werewolves dont kill they just turn you into one of them ?They sometimes kill said Ron who looked unusually grave now .Ive heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away .What was the werewolfs name ?said Harry quickly .Well the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback said Hermione .I knew it the maniac who likes attacking kids the one Lupin told me about !said Harry angrily .Hermione looked at him bleakly .Harry youve got to get that memory she said .Its all about stopping Voldemort isnt it ?These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him .The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet looking terrified .Youll do fine Harry told them both as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test .Good luck .And you too !said Hermione with a significant look as Harry headed off to the dungeons .There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon Harry Ernie and Draco Malfoy .All too young to Apparate just yet ?said Slughorn genially .Not turned seventeen yet ?They shook their heads .Ah well said Slughorn cheerily as were so few well do something fun .I want you all to brew me up something amusing !That sounds good sir said Ernie sycophantically rubbing his hands together .Malfoy on the other hand did not crack a smile .What do you mean ‘something amusing ?he said irritably .Oh surprise me said Slughorn airily .Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced PotionMaking with a sulky expression .It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time .Undoubtedly Harry thought watching him over the top of his own book Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement .Was it his imagination or did Malfoy like Tonks look thinner ?Certainly he looked paler his skin still had that grayish tinge probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days .But there was no air of smugness excitement or superiority none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort .There could be only one conclusion in Harrys opinion The mission whatever it was was going badly .Cheered by this thought Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking and found a heavily corrected HalfBlood Princes version of An Elixir to Induce Euphoria which seemed not only to meet Slughorn s instructions but which might Harrys heart leapt as the thought struck him put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some .Well now this looks absolutely wonderful said Slughorn an hour and a half later clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harrys cauldron .Euphoria I take it ?And whats that I smell ?Mmmm .youve added just a sprig of peppermint havent you ?Unorthodox but what a stroke of inspiration Harry of course that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nosetweaking .I really dont know where you get these brain waves my boy .unless Harry pushed the HalfBlood Princes book deeper into his bag with his foot .its just your mothers genes coming out in you !Oh .yeah maybe said Harry relieved .Ernie was looking rather grumpy determined to outshine Harry for once he had most rashly invented his own potion which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron .Malfoy was already packing up sourfaced Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely passable .The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once .Sir Harry began but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry he hurried away as fast as he could .Professor Professor dont you want to taste my po ?called Harry desperately .But Slughorn had gone .Disappointed Harry emptied the cauldron packed up his things left the dungeon and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room .Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon .Harry !cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole .Harry I passed !Well done !he said .And Ron ?He he just failed whispered Hermione as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose .It was really unlucky a tiny thing the examiner just spotted that hed left half an eyebrow behind .How did it go with Slughorn ?No joy said Harry as Ron joined them .Bad luck mate but youll pass next time we can take it together .Yeah I spose said Ron grumpily .But half an eyebrow Like that matters !I know said Hermione soothingly it does seem really harsh .They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory .So Harry you going to use the Felix Felicis or what ?Ron demanded .Yeah I spose Id better said Harry .I dont reckon Ill need all of it not twelve hours worth it cant take all night .Ill just take a mouthful .Two or three hours should do it .Its a great feeling when you take it said Ron reminiscently .Like you cant do anything wrong .What are you talking about ?said Hermione laughing .Youve never taken any !Yeah but I thought I had didnt I ?said Ron as though explaining the obvious .Same difference really .As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals they lingered for a while in the common room the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there .When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest they decided the moment had come and after checking carefully that Neville Dean and Seamus were all in the common room sneaked up to the boys dormitory .Harry took out the rolledup socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny gleaming bottle .Well here goes said Harry and he raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp .What does it feel like ?whispered Hermione .Harry did not answer for a moment .Then slowly but surely an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him he felt as though he could have done anything anything at all .and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible but positively easy .He got to his feet smiling brimming with confidence .Excellent he said .Really excellent .Right .Im going down to Hagrids .What ?said Ron and Hermione together looking aghast .No Harry youve got to go and see Slughorn remember ?said Hermione .No said Harry confidently .Im going to Hagrids Ive got a good feeling about going to Hagrids .Youve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider ?asked Ron looking stunned .Yeah said Harry pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag .I feel like its the place to be tonight you know what I mean ?No said Ron and Hermione together both looking positively alarmed now .This is Felix Felicis I suppose ?said Hermione anxiously holding up the bottle to the light .You havent got another little bottle full of I dont know Essence of Insanity ?suggested Ron as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders .Harry laughed and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed .Trust me he said .I know what Im doing .or at least he strolled confidently to the door Felix does .He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him .At the foot of the stairs Harry slid through the open door .What were you doing up there with her ?shrieked Lavender Brown staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys dormitories .Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them .Getting through the portrait hole was simple as he approached it Ginny and Dean came through it and Harry was able to slip between them .As he did so he brushed accidentally against Ginny .Dont push me please Dean she said sounding annoyed .Youre always doing that I can get through perfectly well on my own .The portrait swung closed behind Harry but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort .His feeling of elation increasing Harry strode off through the castle .He did not have to creep along for he met nobody on his way but this did not surprise him in the slightest This evening he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts .Why he knew that going to Hagrids was the right thing to do he had no idea .It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time He could not see the final destination he could not see where Slughorn came in but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory .When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door .Beaming Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk .It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrids .It was not strictly on the way but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch where he was pleased but not altogether surprised to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout .Harry lurked behind a low stone wall feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation .I do thank you for taking the time Pomona Slughorn was saying courteously most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight .Oh I quite agree said Professor Sprout warmly .That enough for you ?Plenty plenty said Slughorn who Harry saw was carrying an armful of leafy plants .This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years and some to spare if anybody overstews them .Well good evening to you and many thanks again !Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood invisible .Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself Harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish .Good evening Professor .Merlins beard Harry you made me jump said Slughorn stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary .How did you get out of the castle ?I think Filch mustve forgotten to lock the doors said Harry cheerfully and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl .Ill be reporting that man hes more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me .But why are you out here Harry ?Well sir its Hagrid said Harry who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth .Hes pretty upset .But you wont tell anyone Professor ?I dont want trouble for him .Slughorns curiosity was evidently aroused .Well I cant promise that he said gruffly .But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt so Im sure he cant be up to anything very dreadful .Well its this giant spider hes had it for years .It lived in the forest .It could talk and everything I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest said Slughorn softly looking over at the mass of black trees .Its true then ?Yes said Harry .But this one Aragog the first one Hagrid ever got it died last night .Hes devastated .He wants company while he buries it and I said Id go .Touching touching said Slughorn absentmindedly his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid s cabin .But acromantula venom is very valuable .If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out .Of course I wouldnt want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset .but if there was any way to procure some .I mean its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive .Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now . .seems an awful waste not to collect it .might get a hundred Galleons a pint .To be frank my salary is not large .And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done .Well he said with a most convincing hesitancy well if you wanted to come Professor Hagrid would probably be really pleased .Give Aragog a better sendoff you know .Yes of course said Slughorn his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm .I tell you what Harry Ill meet you down there with a bottle or two .Well drink the poor beasts well not health but well send it off in style anyway once its buried .And Ill change my tie this one is a little exuberant for the occasion .He bustled back into the castle and Harry sped off to Hagrid s delighted with himself .Yeh came croaked Hagrid when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him .Yeah Ron and Hermione couldnt though said Harry .Theyre really sorry .Don don matter .Hedve bin touched yehre here though Harry .Hagrid gave a great sob .He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish and his eyes were puffy red and swollen .Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach .Where are we burying him ?he asked .The forest ?Blimey no said Hagrid wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt .The other spiders won let me anywhere near their webs now Aragogs gone .Turns out it was ony on his orders they didn eat me !Can yeh believe that Harry ?The honest answer was yes Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come facetoface with the acromantulas They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid .Never bin an area o the forest I couldn go before !said Hagrid shaking his head .It wasn easy gettin Aragogs body out o there I can tell yeh they usually eat their dead see .But I wanted ter give im a nice burial .a proper sendoff .He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow saying as he did so for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do Professor Slughorn met me coming down here Hagrid .Not in trouble are yeh ?said Hagrid looking up alarmed .Yeh shouldn be outta the castle in the evenin I know it its my fault No no when he heard what I was doing he said hed like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too said Harry .Hes gone to change into something more suitable I think .and he said hed bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragogs memory .Did he ?said Hagrid looking both astonished and touched .Thas thas righ nice of him that is an not turnin yeh in either .Ive never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before .Cornin ter see old Aragog off though eh ?Well .he dve liked that Aragog would .Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid s hut where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside its legs curled and tangled .Are we going to bury him here Hagrid in your garden ?Jus beyond the pumpkin patch I thought said Hagrid in a choked voice .Ive already dug the yeh know grave .Jus thought wed say a few nice things over him happy memories yeh know His voice quivered and broke .There was a knock on the door and he turned to answer it blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so .Slughorn hurried over the threshold several bottles in his arms and wearing a somber black cravat .Hagrid he said in a deep grave voice .So very sorry to hear of your loss .Thas very nice of yeh said Hagrid .Thanks a lot .An thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither .Wouldnt have dreamed of it said Slughorn .Sad night sad night .Where is the poor creature ?Out here said Hagrid in a shaking voice .Shall we shall we do it then ?The three of them stepped out into the back garden .The moon was glistening palely through the trees now and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrids window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a tenfoothigh mound of freshly dug earth .Magnificent said Slughorn approaching the spiders head where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge curved pincers shone motionless in the moonlight .Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers apparently examining the enormous hairy head .Its not evryone appreciates how beauiful they are said Hagrid to Slughorn s back tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes .I didn know yeh were intrested in creatures like Aragog Horace .Interested ?My dear Hagrid I revere them said Slughorn stepping back from the body .Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak though Hagrid mopping his eyes once more noticed nothing .Now .shall we proceed to the burial ?Hagrid nodded and moved forward .He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and with an enormous grunt rolled it into the dark pit .It hit the bottom with a rather horrible crunchy thud .Hagrid started to cry again .Of course its difficult for you who knew him best said Slughorn who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrids elbow but patted it all the same .Why dont I say a few words ?He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog Harry thought for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said in a slow impressive voice Farewell Aragog king of arachnids whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you wont forget !Though your body will decay your spirit lingers on in the quiet webspun places of your forest home .May your manyeyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained .Tha was .tha was .beauiful !howled Hagrid and he collapsed onto the compost heap crying harder than ever .There there said Slughorn waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound .Lets get inside and have a drink .Get on his other side Harry .Thats it .Up you come Hagrid .Well done .They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table .Fang who had been skulking in his basket during the burial now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harrys lap as usual .Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought .I have had it all tested for poison he assured Harry pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid s bucket sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid .Had a houseelf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert .Harry saw in his minds eye the expression on Hermiones face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves and decided never to mention it to her .One for Harry .said Slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mugs .and one for me .Well he raised his mug high to Aragog .Aragog said Harry and Hagrid together .Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply .Harry however with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis knew that he must not drink so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him .I had him from an egg yeh know said Hagrid morosely .Tiny little thing he was when he hatched .Bout the size of a Pekingese .Sweet said Slughorn .Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until .well .Hagrid s face darkened and Harry knew why Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets .Slughorn however did not seem to be listening he was looking up at the ceiling from which a number of brass pots hung and also a long silky skein of bright white hair .Thats never unicorn hair Hagrid ?Oh yeah said Hagrid indifferently .Gets pulled out of their tails they catch it on branches an stuff in the forest yeh know .But my dear chap do you know how much thats worth ?I use it fer bindin on bandages an stuff if a creature gets injured said Hagrid shrugging .Its dead useful .very strong see .Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now looking Harry knew for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak matured mead crystalized pineapple and velvet smoking jackets .He refilled Hagrids mug and his own and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all .Hagrid becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn s flattering interest stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry .The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast .Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable Indeed Harry grinned to himself as unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill .After an hour or so Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts to Hogwarts to Dumbledore to elfmade wine and to Harry Potter !bellowed Hagrid slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it .Yes indeed cried Slughorn a little thickly Parry Otter the Chosen Boy Who well something of that sort he mumbled and drained his mug too .Not long after this Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn who pocketed it with cries of To friendship !To generosity !To ten Galleons a hair !And for a while after that Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side arms around each other singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo .aargh the good die young muttered Hagrid slumping low onto the table a little crosseyed while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain .Me dad was no age ter go .nor were yer mum an dad Harry .Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid s crinkled eyes again he grasped Harrys arm and shook it .Bes wiz and witchard o their age I never knew .terrible thing .terrible thing .And Odo the hero they bore him back home To the place that hed known as a lad sang Slughorn plaintively .They laid him to rest with his hat inside out And his wand snapped in two which was sad . .terrible Hagrid grunted and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep snoring deeply .Sorry said Slughorn with a hiccup .Cant carry a tune to save my life .Hagrid wasnt talking about your singing said Harry quietly .He was talking about my mum and dad dying .Oh said Slughorn repressing a large belch .Oh dear .Yes that was was terrible indeed .Terrible .terrible .He looked quite at a loss for what to say and resorted to refilling their mugs .I dont dont suppose you remember it Harry ?he asked awkwardly .No well I was only one when they died said Harry his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrids heavy snores .But Ive found out pretty much what happened since .My dad died first .Did you know that ?I I didnt said Slughorn in a hushed voice .Yeah .Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum said Harry .Slughorn gave a great shudder but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harrys face .He told her to get out of the way said Harry remorselessly .He told me she neednt have died .He only wanted me .She could have run .Oh dear breathed Slughorn .She could have .she neednt .Thats awful .It is isnt it ?said Harry in a voice barely more than a whisper .But she didnt move .Dad was already dead but she didnt want me to go too .She tried to plead with Voldemort .but he just laughed .Thats enough !said Slughorn suddenly raising a shaking hand .Really my dear boy enough .Im an old man .I dont need to hear .I dont want to hear I forgot lied Harry Felix Felicis leading him on .You liked her didnt you ?Liked her ?said Slughorn his eyes brimming with tears once more .I dont imagine anyone who met her wouldnt have liked her .Very brave .Very funny .It was the most horrible thing .But you wont help her son said Harry .She gave me her life but you wont give me a memory .Hagrids rumbling snores filled the cabin .Harry looked steadily into Slughorn s tearfilled eyes .The Potions master seemed unable to look away .Dont say that he whispered .It isnt a question .If it were to help you of course .but no purpose can be served .It can said Harry clearly .Dumbledore needs information .I need information .He knew he was safe Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning .Looking Slughorn straight in the eye Harry leaned forward a little .I am the Chosen One .I have to kill him .I need that memory .Slughorn turned paler than ever his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat .You are the Chosen One ?Of course I am said Harry calmly .But then .my dear boy .youre asking a great deal .youre asking me in fact to aid you in your attempt to destroy You dont want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans ?Harry Harry of course I do but Youre scared hell find out you helped me ?Slughorn said nothing he looked terrified .Be brave like my mother Professor .Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby .I am not proud .he whispered through his fingers .I am ashamed of what of what that memory shows .I think I may have done great damage that day .Youd cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory said Harry .It would be a very brave and noble thing to do .Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on .Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle .There was a long long silence but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it to wait .Then very slowly Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand .He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small empty bottle .Still looking into Harrys eyes Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it so that a long silver thread of memory came away too clinging to the wand tip .Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung silvery bright from the wand .Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled then spread swirling like gas .He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry .Thank you very much Professor .Youre a good boy said Professor Slughorn tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache .And youve got her eyes .Just dont think too badly of me once youve seen it .And he too put his head on his arms gave a deep sigh and fell asleep .HORCRUXES Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle .The front door had remained unlocked for him but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts .By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood .What sort of time do you call this ?Im really sorry I had to go out for something important Well the password changed at midnight so youll just have to sleep in the corridor wont you ?Youre joking !said Harry .Why did it have to change at midnight ?Thats the way it is said the Fat Lady .If youre angry go and take it up with the headmaster hes the one whos tightened security .Fantastic said Harry bitterly looking around at the hard floor .Really brilliant .Yeah I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here because hes the one who wanted me to He is here said a voice behind Harry .Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago .Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff .I had it from the Bloody Baron who saw him arrive said Nick .He appeared according to the Baron to be in good spirits though a little tired of course .Where is he ?said Harry his heart leaping .Oh groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower its a favorite pastime of his Not the Bloody Baron Dumbledore !Oh in his office said Nick .I believe from what the Baron said that he had business to attend to before turning in Yeah he has said Harry excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory .He wheeled about and sprinted off again ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him .Come back !All right I lied !I was annoyed you woke me up !The passwords still ‘tapeworm !But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes he was saying toffee eclairs to Dumbledores gargoyle which leapt aside permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase .Enter said Dumbledore when Harry knocked .He sounded exhausted .Harry pushed open the door .There was Dumbledores office looking the same as ever but with black star strewn skies beyond the windows .Good gracious Harry said Dumbledore in surprise .To what do I owe this very late pleasure ?Sir Ive got it .Ive got the memory from Slughorn .Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore .For a moment or two the headmaster looked stunned .Then his face split in a wide smile .Harry this is spectacular news !Very well done indeed !I knew you could do it !All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with Slughorns memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve .And now said Dumbledore placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it .Now at last we shall see .Harry quickly .Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor .Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorns office many years before .There was the much younger Slughorn with his thick shiny strawcolored hair and his gingeryblond mustache sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe a small glass of wine in one hand the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple .And there were the halfdozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them Marvolos goldandblack ring gleaming on his finger .Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ?Tom Tom if I knew I couldnt tell you said Slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle though winking at the same time .I must say Id like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are .Riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks .What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnt and your careful flattery of the people who matter thank you for the pineapple by the way youre quite right it is my favorite Several of the boys tittered again .I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years .Fifteen if you keep sending me pineapple I have excellent contacts at the Ministry .Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again .Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader .I dont know that politics would suit me sir he said when the laughter had died away .I dont have the right kind of background for one thing .A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other .Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke undoubtedly about what they knew or suspected regarding their gang leaders famous ancestor .Nonsense said Slughorn briskly couldnt be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock abilities like yours .No youll go far Tom Ive never been wrong about a student yet .The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn s desk chimed eleven oclock behind him and he looked around .Good gracious is it that time already ?Youd better get going boys or well all be in trouble .Lestrange I want your essay by tomorrow or its detention .Same goes for you Avery .One by one the boys filed out of the room .Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk .A movement behind him made him look around Riddle was still standing there .Look sharp Tom you dont want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect .Sir I wanted to ask you something .Ask away then mboy ask away .Sir I wondered what you know about .about Horcruxes ?Slughorn stared at him his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass .Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts is it ?But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork .Not exactly sir said Riddle .I came across the term while reading and I didnt fully understand it .No .well .youd be hardpushed to find a book at Hogwarts thatll give you details on Horcruxes Tom thats very Dark stuff very Dark indeed said Slughorn .But you obviously know all about them sir ?I mean a wizard like you sorry I mean if you cant tell me obviously I just knew if anyone could tell me you could so I just thought Id ask It was very well done thought Harry the hesitancy the casual tone the careful flattery none of it overdone .He Harry had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work .He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very very much perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks .Well said Slughorn not looking at Riddle but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple well it cant hurt to give you an overview of course .Just so that you understand the term .A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul .I dont quite understand how that works though sir said Riddle .His voice was carefully controlled but Harry could sense his excitement .Well you split your soul you see said Slughorn and hide part of it in an object outside the body .Then even if ones body is attacked or destroyed one cannot die for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged .But of course existence in such a form .Slughorn s face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before I was ripped from my body I was less than spirit less than the meanest ghost .but still I was alive . .few would want it Tom very few .Death would be preferable .But Riddles hunger was now apparent his expression was greedy he could no longer hide his longing .How do you split your soul ?Well said Slughorn uncomfortably you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole .Splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature .But how do you do it ?By an act of evil the supreme act of evil .By committing murder .Killing rips the soul apart .The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage He would encase the torn portion Encase ?But how ?There is a spell do not ask me I dont know !said Slughorn shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes .Do I look as though I have tried it do I look like a killer ?No sir of course not said Riddle quickly .Im sorry .I didnt mean to offend .Not at all not at all not offended said Slughorn gruffly .Its natural to feel some curiosity about these things .Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic .Yes sir said Riddle .What I dont understand though just out of curiosity I mean would one Horcrux be much use ?Can you only split your soul once ?Wouldnt it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more pieces I mean for instance isnt seven the most powerfully magical number wouldnt seven ?Merlins beard Tom !yelped Slughorn .Seven !Isnt it bad enough to think of killing one person ?And in any case .bad enough to divide the soul .but to rip it into seven pieces .Slughorn looked deeply troubled now He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all .Of course he muttered this is all hypothetical what were discussing isnt it ?All academic .Yes sir of course said Riddle quickly .But all the same Tom .keep it quiet what Ive told thats to say what weve discussed .People wouldnt like to think weve been chatting about Horcruxes .Its a banned subject at Hogwarts you know .Dumbledores particularly fierce about it .I wont say a word sir said Riddle and he left but not before Harry had glimpsed his face which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features but made them somehow less human .Thank you Harry said Dumbledore quietly .Let us go .When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk .Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak .I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time said Dumbledore at last .It confirms the theory on which I have been working it tells me that I am right and also how very far there is still to go .Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation .A corpulent rednosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet .Well Harry said Dumbledore I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard .At the same age as you are now give or take a few months Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal .You think he succeeded then sir ?asked Harry .He made a Horcrux ?And thats why he didnt die when he attacked me ?He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere ?A bit of his soul was safe ?A bit .or more said Dumbledore .You heard Voldemort What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times rip his soul repeatedly so as to store it in many separately concealed Horcruxes .No book would have given him that information .As far as I know as far I am sure as Voldemort knew no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two .Dumbledore paused for a moment marshaling his thoughts and then said Four years ago I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul .Where ?asked Harry How ?You handed it to me Harry said Dumbledore .The diary Riddles diary the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets .I dont understand sir said Harry .Well although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed .A mere memory starting to act and think for itself ?A mere memory sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen ?No something much more sinister had lived inside that book .a fragment of soul I was almost sure of it .The diary had been a Horcrux .But this raised as many questions as it answered .What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard .I still dont understand said Harry .Well it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work in other words the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner .But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else so that Slytherins monster would be unleashed again .Well he didnt want his hard work to be wasted said Harry .He wanted people to know he was Slytherins heir because he couldnt take credit at the time .Quite correct said Dumbledore nodding .But dont you see Harry that if he intended the diary to be passed to or planted on some future Hogwarts student he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it .The point of a Horcrux is as Professor Slughorn explained to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fling it into somebody elses path and run the risk that they might destroy it as indeed happened That particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that .The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me .It suggested that he must have made or been planning to make more Horcruxes so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental .I did not wish to believe it but nothing else seemed to make sense .Then you told me two years later that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters .who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality .That was what you told me he said . ‘Further than anybody And I thought I knew what that meant though the Death Eaters did not .He was referring to his Horcruxes Horcruxes in the plural Harry which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had .Yet it fitted Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil So hes made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people ?said Harry .Why couldnt he make a Sorcerers Stone or steal one if he was so interested in immortality ?Well we know that he tried to do just that five years ago said Dumbledore .But there are several reasons why I think a Sorcerers Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort .While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life it must be drunk regularly for all eternity if the drinker is to maintain their immortality .Therefore Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir and if it ran out or was contaminated or if the Stone was stolen he would die just like any other man .Voldemort likes to operate alone remember .I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent even on the Elixir intolerable .Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he was condemned after attacking you but only to regain a body .Thereafter I am convinced he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes He would need nothing more if only he could regain a human form .He was already immortal you see .or as close to immortal as any man can be .But now Harry armed with this information the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before .You heard him Harry ‘Wouldnt it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more pieces .isnt seven the most powerfully magical number .Isnt seven the most powerfully magical number .Yes I think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort .He made seven Horcruxes ?said Harry horror struck while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage .But they could be anywhere in the world hidden buried or invisible I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem said Dumbledore calmly .But firstly no Harry not seven Horcruxes six .The seventh part of his soul however maimed resides inside his regenerated body .That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile without that he has no self at all .That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack the piece that lives in his body .But the six Horcruxes then said Harry a little desperately how are we supposed to find them ?You are forgetting .you have already destroyed one of them .And I have destroyed another .You have ?said Harry eagerly .Yes indeed said Dumbledore and he raised his blackened burnedlooking hand .The ring Harry .Marvolos ring .And a terrible curse there was upon it too .Had it not been forgive me the lack of seemly modesty for my own prodigious skill and for Professor Snapes timely action when I returned to Hogwarts desperately injured I might not have lived to tell the tale .However a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemorts soul .The ring is no longer a Horcrux .But how did you find it ?Well as you now know for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemorts past life .I have traveled widely visiting those places he once knew .I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts house .It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it he did not want to wear it anymore .He hid it protected by many powerful enchantments in the shack where his ancestors had once lived Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban of course never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment .However we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily .You destroyed the diary and I the ring but if we are right in our theory of a sevenpart soul four Horcruxes remain .And they could be anything ?said Harry .They could be old tin cans or I dunno empty potion bottles .You are thinking of Portkeys Harry which must be ordinary objects easy to overlook .But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul ?You are forgetting what I have showed you .Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history .His pride his belief in his own superiority his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care favoring objects worthy of the honor .The diary wasnt that special .The diary as you have said yourself was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance .So the other Horcruxes ?said Harry .Do you think you know what they are sir ?I can only guess said Dumbledore .For the reasons I have already given I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that in themselves have a certain grandeur .I have therefore trawled back through Voldemorts past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him .The locket !said Harry loudly .Hufflepuffs cup !Yes said Dumbledore smiling I would be prepared to bet perhaps not my other hand but a couple of fingers that they became Horcruxes three and four .The remaining two assuming again that he created a total of six are more of a problem but I will hazard a guess that having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw .Four objects from the four founders would I am sure have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemorts imagination .I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaws .I am confident however that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe .Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him where a rubyencrusted sword reposed within a glass case .Do you think thats why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts sir ?said Harry .To try and find something from one of the other founders ?My thoughts precisely said Dumbledore .But unfortunately that does not advance us much further for he was turned away or so I believe without the chance to search the school .I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders objects .He definitely had two he may have found three that is the best we can do for now .Even if he got something of Ravenclaws or of Gryffindors that leaves a sixth Horcrux said Harry counting on his fingers .Unless he got both ?I dont think so said Dumbledore .I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is .I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake Nagini ?The snake ?said Harry startled .You can use animals as Horcruxes ?Well it is inadvisable to do so said Dumbledore because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business .However if my calculations are correct Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents house with the intention of killing you .He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths .You would certainly have been that .He believed that in killing you he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined .He believed he was making himself invincible .I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death .As we know he failed .After an interval of some years however he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux .She underlines the Slytherin connection which enhances Lord Voldemorts mystique I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything he certainly likes to keep her close and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her even for a Parselmouth .So said Harry the diarys gone the rings gone .The cup the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaws or Gryffindors ?An admirably succinct and accurate summary yes said Dumbledore bowing his head .So .are you still looking for them sir ?Is that where youve been going when youve been leaving the school ?Correct said Dumbledore .I have been looking for a very long time .I think .perhaps .I may be close to finding another one .There are hopeful signs .And if you do said Harry quickly can I come with you and help get rid of it ?Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying Yes I think so .I can ?said Harry thoroughly taken aback .Oh yes said Dumbledore smiling slightly .I think you have earned that right .Harry felt his heart lift .It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once .The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledores decision Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted .Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed sir ?Can he feel it ?Harry asked ignoring the portraits .A very interesting question Harry .I believe not .I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long he does not feel as we do .Perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss .but he was not aware for instance that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy .When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers I am told that his anger was terrible to behold .But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts ?Yes he did years ago when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts sayso and he never received it for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary .No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully but he was counting too much upon Luciuss fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead .Of course Lucius did not know what the diary really was .I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted .Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke .Ah poor Lucius .what with Voldemort s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain and the fiasco at the Ministry last year I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment .Harry sat in thought for a moment then asked So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed Voldemort could be killed ?Yes I think so said Dumbledore .Without his Horcruxes Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul .Never forget though that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair his brain and his magical powers remain intact .It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes .But I havent got uncommon skill and power said Harry before he could stop himself .Yes you have said Dumbledore firmly .You have a power that Voldemort has never had .You can I know !said Harry impatiently .I can love !It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding Big deal !Yes Harry you can love said Dumbledore who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying .Which given everything that has happened to you is a great and remarkable thing .You are still too young to understand how unusual you are Harry .So when the prophecy says that Ill have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not it just means love ?asked Harry feeling a little let down .Yes just love said Dumbledore .But Harry never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so .I told you this at the end of last year .Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him and in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him !But it comes to the same No it doesnt !said Dumbledore sounding impatient now .Pointing at Harry with his black withered hand he said You are setting too much store by the prophecy !But spluttered Harry but you said the prophecy means If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled ?Would it have meant anything ?Of course not !Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled ?But said Harry bewildered but last year you said one of us would have to kill the other Harry Harry only because Voldemort made a grave error and acted on Professor Trelawneys words !If Voldemort had never murdered your father would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge ?Of course not !If he had not forced your mother to die for you would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate ?Of course not Harry !Dont you see ?Voldemort himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do !Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress ?All of them realize that one day amongst their many victims there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back !Voldemort is no different !Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him .He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapons !But It is essential that you understand this !said Dumbledore standing up and striding about the room his glittering robes swooshing in his wake Harry had never seen him so agitated .By attempting to kill you Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me and gave him the tools for the job !It is Voldemort s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts his ambitions that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders and yet Harry despite your privileged insight into Voldemorts world which incidentally is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts never even for a second shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemorts followers !Of course I havent !said Harry indignantly .He killed my mum and dad !You are protected in short by your ability to love !said Dumbledore loudly .The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemorts !In spite of all the temptation you have endured all the suffering you remain pure of heart just as pure as you were at the age of eleven when you stared into a mirror that reflected your hearts desire and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort and not immortality or riches .Harry have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror ?Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with but he did not !But he knows it now .You have flitted into Lord Voldemorts mind without damage to yourself but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony as he discovered in the Ministry .I do not think he understands why Harry but then he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole .But sir said Harry making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative it all comes to the same thing doesnt it ?Ive got to try and kill him or Got to ?said Dumbledore .Of course youve got to !But not because of the prophecy !Because you yourself will never rest until youve tried !We both know it !Imagine please just for a moment that you had never heard that prophecy !How would you feel about Voldemort now ?Think !Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him and thought .He thought of his mother his father and Sirius .He thought of Cedric Diggory .He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done .A flame seemed to leap inside his chest searing his throat .Id want him finished said Harry quietly .And Id want to do it .Of course you would !cried Dumbledore .You see the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything !But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal .In other words you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy !But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy .He will continue to hunt you .which makes it certain really that That one of us is going to end up killing the other said Harry .Yes .But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him .It was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high .Some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but Dumbledore knew and so do I thought Harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parents that there was all the difference in the world .SECTUMSEMPRA Exhausted but delighted with his nights work Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next mornings Charms lesson having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them .They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemorts Horcruxes and Dumbledores promise to take Harry along should he find another one .Wow said Ron when Harry had finally finished telling them everything Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing .Wow .Youre actually going to go with Dumbledore .and try and destroy .wow .Ron youre making it snow said Hermione patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flakes had started to fall .Lavender Brown Harry noticed glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes and Hermione immediately let go of Rons arm .Oh yeah said Ron looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise .Sorry .looks like weve all got horrible dandruff now .He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione s shoulder .Lavender burst into tears .Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her .We split up he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth .Last night .When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione .Obviously she couldnt see you so she thought it had just been the two of us .Ah said Harry .Well you dont mind its over do you ?No Ron admitted .It was pretty bad while she was yelling but at least I didnt have to finish it .Coward said Hermione though she looked amused .Well it was a bad night for romance all around .Ginny and Dean split up too Harry .Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga .Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could he asked How come ?Oh something really silly .She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she couldnt climb in herself .but theyve been a bit rocky for ages .Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom .He certainly looked unhappy .Of course this puts you in a bit of a dilemma doesnt it ?said Hermione .What dyou mean ?said Harry quickly .The Quidditch team said Hermione .If Ginny and Dean arent speaking .Oh oh yeah said Harry .Flitwick said Ron in a warning tone .The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid whereas the contents of Harrys and Rons were still murky brown .Now now boys squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully .A little less talk a little more action .Let me see you try .Together they raised their wands concentrating with all their might and pointed them at their flasks .Harrys vinegar turned to ice Rons flask exploded .Yes .for homework said Professor Flitwick reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat practice .They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together .Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender and Hermione seemed cheery too though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said Its a nice day .Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harrys brain Shes Rons sister .But shes ditched Dean !Shes still Rons sister .Im his best mate !Thatll make it worse .If I talked to him first Hed hit you .What if I dont care ?Hes your best mate Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there until Hermione cried Katie !Youre back !Are you okay ?Harry stared It was indeed Katie Bell looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends .Im really well !she said happily .They let me out of St .Mungos on Monday I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning .Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match Harry .Yeah said Harry well now youre back and Rons fit well have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw which means we could still be in the running for the Cup .Listen Katie .He had to put the question to her at once his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain .He dropped his voice as Katies friends started gathering up their things apparently they were late for Transfiguration . .that necklace .can you remember who gave it to you now ?No said Katie shaking her head ruefully .Everyones been asking me but I havent got a clue .The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies in the Three Broomsticks .You definitely went into the bathroom then ?said Hermione .Well I know I pushed open the door said Katie so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it .After that my memorys a blank until about two weeks ago in St .Mungos .Listen Id better go I wouldnt put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back .She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends leaving Harry Ron and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them .So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace said Hermione to be in the ladies bathroom .Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman said Harry .Dont forget there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts .We know some of it got stolen .In his minds eye he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past all transformed into girls .I think Im going to take another swig of Felix said Harry and have a go at the Room of Requirement again .That would be a complete waste of potion said Hermione flatly putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag .Luck can only get you so far Harry .The situation with Slughorn was different you always had the ability to persuade him you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit .Luck isnt enough to get you through a powerful enchantment though .Dont go wasting the rest of that potion !Youll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him .She dropped her voice to a whisper .Couldnt we make some more ?Ron asked Harry ignoring Hermione .Itd be great to have a stock of it . .Have a look in the book .Harry pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis .Blimey its seriously complicated he said running an eye down the list of ingredients .And it takes six months .Youve got to let it stew .Typical said Ron .Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down turning to it he saw the Sectumsempra spell captioned For Enemies that he had marked a few weeks previously .He had still not found out what it did mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares .The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser .He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him merely grunting and shrugging but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back .The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain .His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen so glad to have Katie back at last that they were flying extremely well .Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean on the contrary she was the life and soul of the team .Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold kept them all highly amused .Harry laughing with the others was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch .The battle still raged inside his head Ginny or Ron ?Sometimes he thought that the postLavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out but then he remembered Rons expression when he had seen her kissing Dean and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand .Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny laughing with her walking back from practice with her however much his conscience ached he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own .It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties for Ron would not be around but unfortunately Slughorn seemed to have given them up .Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermiones help but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes .And to complicate matters he had the nagging worry that if he didnt do it somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good .All in all the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day for surely this was a case for as Hermione put it tweaking the circumstances ?The balmy days slid gently through May and Ron seemed to be there at Harrys shoulder every time he saw Ginny .Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds .There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else .Ron was not unique in this respect interest in the GryffindorRavenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school for the match would decide the Championship which was still wide open .If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points a tall order and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better then they would win the Championship .If they won by less than three hundred points they would come second to Ravenclaw if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred they would be in fourth place and nobody Harry thought would ever ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottomofthetable defeat in two centuries .The runup to this crucial match had all the usual features members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up .Somehow the game had become inextricably linked in Harrys mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny .He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis .In the midst of all his preoccupations Harry had not forgotten his other ambition finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement .He was still checking the Marauders Map and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room .Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity but no matter how he reworded his request the wall remained firmly doorless .A few days before the match against Ravenclaw Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay .More out of habit than anything Harry made his usual detour along the seventhfloor corridor checking the Marauders Map as he went .For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again but then he saw Malfoys tiny labeled dot standing in a boys bathroom on the floor below accompanied not by Crabbe or Goyle but by Moaning Myrtle .Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor .The loud crash brought him out of his reverie hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below .Outside the bathroom he pressed his ear against the door .He could not hear anything .He very quietly pushed the door open .Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door his hands clutching either side of the sink his white blond head bowed .Dont crooned Moaning Myrtles voice from one of the cubicles .Dont .tell me whats wrong .I can help you .No one can help me said Malfoy .His whole body was shaking .I cant do it .I cant .It wont work .and unless I do it soon .he says hell kill me .And Harry realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that Malfoy was crying actually crying tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin .Malfoy gasped and gulped and then with a great shudder looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder .Malfoy wheeled around drawing his wand .Instinctively Harry pulled out his own .Malfoys hex missed Harry by inches shattering the lamp on the wall beside him Harry threw himself sideways thought Levicorpus and flicked his wand but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another No !No !Stop it !squealed Moaning Myrtle her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room .Stop !STOP !There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded Harry attempted a LegLocker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoys ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle who screamed loudly water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy his face contorted cried Cruci SECTUMSEMPRAl bellowed Harry from the floor waving his wand wildly .Blood spurted from Malfoys face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword .He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash his wand falling from his limp right hand .No gasped Harry .Slipping and staggering Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy whose face was now shining scarlet his white hands scrabbling at his blood soaked chest .No I didnt Harry did not know what he was saying he fell to his knees beside Malfoy who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood .Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream MURDER !MURDER IN THE BATHROOM !MURDER !The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up terrified Snape had burst into the room his face livid .Pushing Harry roughly aside he knelt over Malfoy drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harrys curse had made muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song .The flow of blood seemed to ease Snape wiped the residue from Malfoys face and repeated his spell .Now the wounds seemed to be knitting .Harry was still watching horrified by what he had done barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water .Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead .When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time he halflifted Malfoy into a standing position .You need the hospital wing .There may be a certain amount of scarring but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that .Come .He supported Malfoy across the bathroom turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury And you Potter .You wait here for me .It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey .He stood up slowly shaking and looked down at the wet floor .There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface .He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment .Snape returned ten minutes later .He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him .Go he said to Myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once leaving a ringing silence behind her .I didnt mean it to happen said Harry at once .His voice echoed in the cold watery space .I didnt know what that spell did .But Snape ignored this .Apparently I underestimated you Potter he said quietly .Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic ?Who taught you that spell ?I read about it somewhere .Where ?It was a library book Harry invented wildly .I cant remember what it was call Liar said Snape .Harrys throat went dry .He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it .The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes he struggled to block out all thought but try as he might the HalfBlood Princes copy of Advanced PotionMaking swam hazily to the forefront of his mind .And then he was staring at Snape again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom .He stared into Snapes black eyes hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared but Bring me your schoolbag said Snape softly and all of your schoolbooks .All of them .Bring them to me here .Now !There was no point arguing .Harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom .Once in the corridor he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower .Most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past .He felt stunned it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book ?And what would happen when Snape saw it ?Would he tell Slughorn Harrys stomach churned how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year ?Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much .the book that had become a kind of guide and friend ?Harry could not let it happen .He could not .Where Ve you ?Why are you soaking ?Is that blood ?Ron was standing at the top of the stairs looking bewildered at the sight of Harry .I need your book Harry panted .Your Potions book .Quick .give it to me .But what about the HalfBlood Ill explain later !Ron pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and handed it over Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room .Here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the seventhfloor corridor .He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls closed his eyes and began to walk .I need a place to hide my book .I need a place to hide my book .I need a place to hide my book .Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall .When he opened his eyes there it was at last the door to the Room of Requirement .Harry wrenched it open flung himself inside and slammed it shut .He gasped .Despite his haste his panic his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at .He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants .There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture stowed away perhaps to hide the evidence of mishandled magic or else hidden by castleproud houseelves .There were thousands and thousands of books no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen .There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items there were chipped bottles of congealed potions hats jewels cloaks there were what looked like dragon eggshells corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly several rusting swords and a heavy bloodstained axe .Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure .He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll ran on a short way took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface .He opened one of the cupboards creaking doors It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died its skeleton had five legs .He stuffed the HalfBlood Princes book behind the cage and slammed the door .He paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter .Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk ?Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go back to the door back out onto the corridor where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone .Harry ran flatout toward the bathroom on the floor below cramming Rons copy of Advanced Potion Making into his bag as he did so .A minute later he was back in front of Snape who held out his hand wordlessly for Harrys schoolbag .Harry handed it over panting a searing pain in his chest and waited .One by one Snape extracted Harrys books and examined them .Finally the only book left was the Potions book which he looked at very carefully before speaking .This is your copy of Advanced PotionMaking is it Potter ?Yes said Harry still breathing hard .Youre quite sure of that are you Potter ?Yes said Harry with a touch more defiance .This is the copy of Advanced PotionMaking that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts ?Yes said Harry firmly .Then why asked Snape does it have the name ‘Roonil Wazlib written inside the front cover ?Harrys heart missed a beat .Thats my nickname he said .Your nickname repeated Snape .Yeah .thats what my friends call me said Harry .I understand what a nickname is said Snape .The cold black eyes were boring once more into Harrys he tried not to look into them .Close your mind .Close your mind .But he had never learned how to do it properly .Do you know what I think Potter ?said Snape very quietly .I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term .What do you think Potter ?I I dont agree sir said Harry still refusing to look into Snape s eyes .Well we shall see how you feel after your detentions said Snape .Ten oclock Saturday morning Potter .My office .But sir .said Harry looking up desperately .Quidditch .the last match of the .Ten oclock whispered Snape with a smile that showed his yellow teeth .Poor Gryffindor .fourth place this year I fear .And he left the bathroom without another word leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror feeling sicker he was sure than Ron had ever felt in his life .I wont say ‘I told you so said Hermione an hour later in the common room .Leave it Hermione said Ron angrily .Harry had never made it to dinner he had no appetite at all .He had just finished telling Ron Hermione and Ginny what had happened not that there seemed to have been much need .The news had traveled very fast Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened .Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term .I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person Hermione said evidently unable to stop herself .And I was right wasnt I ?No I dont think you were said Harry stubbornly .He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him the looks on the Gryffindor teams faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all .He could feel Ginnys eyes on him now but did not meet them he did not want to see disappointment or anger there .He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place .Perhaps if they won Ginny and Dean would make up during the postmatch euphoria .The thought went through Harry like an icy knife .Harry said Hermione how can you still stick up for that book when that spell Will you stop harping on about the book !snapped Harry .The Prince only copied it out !Its not like he was advising anyone to use it !For all we know he was making a note of something that had been used against him !I dont believe this said Hermione .Youre actually defending Im not defending what I did !said Harry quickly .I wish I hadnt done it and not just because Ive got about a dozen detentions .You know I wouldntve used a spell like that not even on Malfoy but you cant blame the Prince he hadnt written ‘try this out its really good he was just making notes for himself wasnt he not for anyone else .Are you telling me said Hermione that youre going to go back ?And get the book ?Yeah I am said Harry forcefully .Listen without the Prince Id never have won the Felix Felicis .Id never have known how to save Ron from poisoning Id never have got a reputation for Potions brilliance you dont deserve said Hermione nastily .Give it a rest Hermione !said Ginny and Harry was so amazed so grateful he looked up .By the sound of it Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve !Well of course Im glad Harry wasnt cursed !said Hermione clearly stung .But you cant call that Sectumsempra spell good Ginny look where its landed him !And Id have thought seeing what this has done to your chances in the match Oh dont start acting as though you understand Quidditch snapped Ginny youll only embarrass yourself .Harry and Ron stared Hermione and Ginny who had always got on together very well were now sitting with their arms folded glaring in opposite directions .Ron looked nervously at Harry then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it .Harry however little though he knew he deserved it felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening .His lightheartedness was shortlived .There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season .By Saturday morning whatever he might have told Hermione Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron Ginny and the others .It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan .Ah Potter said Snape when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape despite teaching floors above now had not vacated it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls .Ominously there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit they had an aura of tedious hard and pointless work about them .Mr Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files said Snape softly .They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments .Where the ink has grown faint or the cards have suffered damage from mice we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and making sure that they are in alphabetical order replace them in the boxes .You will not use magic .Right Professor said Harry with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables .I thought you could start said Snape a malicious smile on his lips with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fiftysix .You will find some familiar names in there which should add interest to the task .Here you see .He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read ‘James Potter and Sirius Black .Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey .Aubreys head twice normal size .Double detention .Snape sneered .It must be such a comfort to think that though they are gone a record of their great achievements remains .Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach .Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him .It was as Harry had anticipated useless boring work punctuated as Snape had clearly planned with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Siriuss names usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew .And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments he wondered what was going on outside where the match would have just started .Ginny playing Seeker against Cho .Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall .It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly ?He could not have been here for only half an hour .an hour .an hour and a half .Harrys stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve .Snape who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task finally looked up at ten past one .I think that will do he said coldly .Mark the place you have reached .You will continue at ten oclock next Saturday .Yes sir .Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind racing back up the stone steps straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch but all was quiet . .It was over then .He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall then ran up the marble staircase whether Gryffindor had won or lost the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room .Quid agis ?he said tentatively to the Fat Lady wondering what he would find inside .Her expression was unreadable as she replied Youll see .And she swung forward .A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her .Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him several hands pulled him into the room .We won !yelled Ron bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry .We won !Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty !We won !Harry looked around there was Ginny running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him .And without thinking without planning it without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching Harry kissed her .After several long moments or it might have been half an hour or possibly several sunlit days they broke apart .The room had gone very quiet .Then several people wolfwhistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling .Harry looked over the top of Ginnys head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something .Hermione was beaming but Harrys eyes sought Ron .At last he found him still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head .For a fraction of a second they looked at each other then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean Well if you must .The creature in his chest roaring in triumph he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole .A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated during which if they had time they might discuss the match .THE SEER OVERHEARD The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people most of them girls yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks .After all it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark Magic .Youd think people had better things to gossip about said Ginny as she sat on the common room floor leaning against Harrys legs and reading the Daily Prophet Three dementor attacks in a week and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if its true youve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest .Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter .Harry ignored them .What did you tell her ?I told her its a Hungarian Horntail said Ginny turning a page of the newspaper idly .Much more macho .Thanks said Harry grinning .And what did you tell her Rons got ?A Pygmy Puff but I didnt say where .Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing .Watch it he said pointing warningly at Harry and Ginny .Just because Ive given my permission doesnt mean I cant withdraw it ‘Your permission scoffed Ginny .Since when did you give me permission to do anything ?Anyway you said yourself youd rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean .Yeah I would said Ron grudgingly .And just as long as you dont start snogging each other in public You filthy hypocrite !What about you and Lavender thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place ?demanded Ginny .But Rons tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June for Harry and Ginnys time together was becoming increasingly restricted .Ginnys O .W .L .s were approaching and she was therefore forced to study for hours into the night .On one such evening when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunchtime Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face .I want to talk to you Harry .What about ?said Harry suspiciously .Only the previous day Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations .The socalled HalfBlood Prince .Oh not again he groaned .Will you please drop it ?He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly though Slughorn who approved of Ginny had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick .But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Princes book and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout .Im not dropping it said Hermione firmly until youve heard me out .Now Ive been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells He didnt make a hobby of it He he who says its a he ?Weve been through this said Harry crossly .Prince Hermione PrinceV Right !said Hermione red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry .Look at that !Look at the picture !Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph yellowed with age Ron leaned over for a look too .The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen .She was not pretty she looked simultaneously cross and sullen with heavy brows and a long pallid face .Underneath the photograph was the caption EILEEN PRINCE CAPTAIN OF THE HOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM .So ?said Harry scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions .Her name was Eileen Prince .Prince Harry .They looked at each other and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to say .He burst out laughing .No way .What ?You think she was the HalfBlood . ?Oh come on .Well why not ?Harry there arent any real princes in the Wizarding world !Its either a nickname a made up title somebodys given themselves or it could be their actual name couldnt it ?No listen !If say her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince and her mother was a Muggle then that would make her a halfblood Prince !Yeah very ingenious Hermione .But it would !Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince !Listen Hermione I can tell its not a girl .I can just tell .The truth is that you dont think a girl would have been clever enough said Hermione angrily .How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever ?said Harry stung by this .Its the way he writes I just know the Prince was a bloke I can tell .This girl hasnt got anything to do with it .Where did you get this anyway ?The library said Hermione predictably .Theres a whole collection of old Prophets up there .Well Im going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can .Enjoy yourself said Harry irritably .I will said Hermione .And the first place Ill look she shot at him as she reached the portrait hole is records of old Potions awards !Harry scowled after her for a moment then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky .Shes just never got over you outperforming her in Potions said Ron returning to his copy of A Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi .You dont think Im mad wanting that book back do you ?Course not said Ron robustly .He was a genius the Prince .Anyway .without his bezoar tip .He drew his finger significantly across his own throat .I wouldnt be here to discuss it would I ?I mean Im not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great Nor am I said Harry quickly .But he healed all right didnt he ?Back on his feet in no time .Yeah said Harry this was perfectly true although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same .Thanks to Snape .You still got detention with Snape this Saturday ?Ron continued .Yeah and the Saturday after that and the Saturday after that sighed Harry .And hes hinting now that if I dont get all the boxes done by the end of term well carry on next year .He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny .Indeed he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this for he was keeping Harry later and later every time while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered .Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes who was holding out a scroll of parchment .Thanks Jimmy .Hey its from Dumbledore !said Harry excitedly unrolling the parchment and scanning it .He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can !They stared at each other .Blimey whispered Ron .You dont reckon .he hasnt found . ?Better go and see hadnt I ?said Harry jumping to his feet .He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could passing nobody but Peeves who swooped past in the opposite direction throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harrys defensive jinx .Once Peeves had vanished there was silence in the corridors with only fifteen minutes left until curfew most people had already returned to their common rooms .And then Harry heard a scream and a crash .He stopped in his tracks listening .How dare you aargh !The noise was coming from a corridor nearby Harry sprinted toward it his wand at the ready hurtled around another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor her head covered in one of her many shawls several sherry bottles lying beside her one broken .Professor Harry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet .Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses .She hiccuped loudly patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harrys helping arm .What happened Professor ?You may well ask !she said shrilly .I was strolling along brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed .But Harry was not paying much attention .He had just noticed where they were standing There on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and on the left that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed Professor were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement ? .omens I have been vouchsafed what ?She looked suddenly shifty .The Room of Requirement repeated Harry .Were you trying to get in there ?I well I didnt know students knew about Not all of them do said Harry .But what happened ?You screamed .It sounded as though you were hurt .I well said Professor Trelawney drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes .I wished to ah deposit certain um personal items in the room .And she muttered something about nasty accusations .Right said Harry glancing down at the sherry bottles .But you couldnt get in and hide them ?He found this very odd the room had opened for him after all when he had wanted to hide the HalfBlood Princes book .Oh I got in all right said Professor Trelawney glaring at the wall .But there was somebody already in there .Somebody in ?Who ?demanded Harry .Who was in there ?I have no idea said Professor Trelawney looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harrys voice .I walked into the room and I heard a voice which has never happened before in all my years of hiding of using the room I mean .A voice ?Saying what ?I dont know that it was saying anything said Professor Trelawney .It was .whooping .Whooping ?Gleefully she said nodding .Harry stared at her .Was it male or female ?I would hazard a guess at male said Professor Trelawney .And it sounded happy ?Very happy said Professor Trelawney sniffily .As though it was celebrating ?Most definitely .And then ?And then I called out Whos there ?You couldnt have found out who it was without asking ?Harry asked her slightly frustrated .The Inner Eye said Professor Trelawney with dignity straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices .Right said Harry hastily he had heard about Professor Trelawneys Inner Eye all too often before .And did the voice say who was there ?No it did not she said .Everything went pitch black and the next thing I knew I was being hurled headfirst out of the room !And you didnt see that coming ?said Harry unable to help himself .No I did not as I say it was pitch She stopped and glared at him suspiciously .I think youd better tell Professor Dumbledore said Harry .He ought to know Malfoys celebrating I mean that someone threw you out of the room .To his surprise Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion looking haughty .The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me she said coldly .I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it .If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harrys wrist .Again and again no matter how I lay them out And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls .the lightningstruck tower she whispered .Calamity .Disaster .Coming nearer all the time .Right said Harry again .Well .I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room .You think so ?Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure .Im going to see him right now said Harry .Ive got a meeting with him .We could go together .Oh well in that case said Professor Trelawney with a smile .She bent down scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blueandwhite vase standing in a nearby niche .I miss having you in my classes Harry she said soulfully as they set off together .You were never much of a Seer .but you were a wonderful Object Harry did not reply he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawneys continual predictions of doom .I am afraid she went on that the nag Im sorry the centaur knows nothing of cartomancy .I asked him one Seer to another had he not too sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe ?But he seemed to find me almost comical .Yes comical !Her voice rose rather hysterically and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind .Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my greatgreatgrandmothers gift .Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years .You know what I say to such people Harry ?Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school put so much trust in me all these years had I not proved myself to him ?Harry mumbled something indistinct .I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore went on Professor Trelawney in throaty tones .He was deeply impressed of course deeply impressed .I was staying at the Hogs Head which I do not advise incidentally bedbugs dear boy but funds were low .Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room .He questioned me .I must confess that at first I thought he seemed illdisposed toward Divination .and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd I had not eaten much that day .but then .And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time for he knew what had happened then Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life the prophecy about him and Voldemort . .but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape !What ?Yes there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs although Im afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore you see he himself was seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tips !Well after that you know Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job and I could not help thinking Harry that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes Harry dear ?She looked back over her shoulder having only just realized that Harry was no longer with her he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other .Harry ?she repeated uncertainly .Perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and frightened .Harry was standing stock still as waves of shock crashed over him wave after wave obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long .It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy .It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort .Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son .Nothing else mattered to Harry just now .Harry ?said Professor Trelawney again .Harry I thought we were going to see the headmaster together ?You stay here said Harry through numb lips .But dear .I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of You stay here !Harry repeated angrily .She looked alarmed as he ran past her around the corner into Dumbledores corridor where the lone gargoyle stood sentry .Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time .He did not knock upon Dumbledores door he hammered and the calm voice answered Enter after Harry had already flung himself into the room .Fawkes the phoenix looked around his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows .Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds a long black traveling cloak in his arms .Well Harry I promised that you could come with me .For a moment or two Harry did not understand the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly .Come .with you . ?Only if you wish it of course .If I .And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledores office in the first place .Youve found one ?Youve found a Horcrux ?I believe so .Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement For several moments Harry could not speak .It is natural to be afraid said Dumbledore . ‘Tm not scared !said Harry at once and it was perfectly true fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all .Which Horcrux is it ?Where is it ?I am not sure which it is though I think we can rule out the snake but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip you remember ?Yes said Harry .How is it protected ?I do not know I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong .Dumbledore hesitated then said Harry I promised you that you could come with me and I stand by that promise but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous .Im coming said Harry almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking .Boiling with anger at Snape his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes .This seemed to show on Harrys face for Dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at Harry a slight crease between his silver eyebrows .What has happened to you ?Nothing lied Harry promptly .What has upset you ?Im not upset .Harry you were never a good Occlumens The word was the spark that ignited Harrys fury .Snape !he said very loudly and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them .Snapes whats happened !He told Voldemort about the prophecy it was him he listened outside the door Trelawney told me !Dumbledores expression did not change but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun .For a long moment Dumbledore said nothing .When did you find out about this ?he asked at last .Just now !said Harry who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty .And then suddenly he could not stop himself .AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD !Breathing hard as though he was fighting Harry turned away from Dumbledore who still had not moved a muscle and paced up and down the study rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over .He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger .Harry said Dumbledore quietly .Please listen to me .It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting .Harry paused biting his lip and looked into Dumbledores lined face .Professor Snape made a terrible Dont tell me it was a mistake sir he was listening at the door !Please let me finish .Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly then went on .Professor Snape made a terrible mistake .He was still in Lord Voldemorts employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawneys prophecy .Naturally he hastened to tell his master what he had heard for it concerned his master most deeply .But he did not know he had no possible way of knowing which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew that they were your mother and father Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter .He hated my dad like he hated Sirius !Havent you noticed Professor how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead ?You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy Harry .I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned But hes a very good Occlumens isnt he sir ?said Harry whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady .And isnt Voldemort convinced that Snapes on his side even now ?Professor .how can you be sure Snapes on our side ?Dumbledore did not speak for a moment he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something .At last he said I am sure .I trust Severus Snape completely .Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself .It did not work .Well I dont !he said as loudly as before .Hes up to something with Draco Malfoy right now right under your nose and you still We have discussed this Harry said Dumbledore and now he sounded stern again .I have told you my views .Youre leaving the school tonight and Ill bet you havent even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to To what ?asked Dumbledore his eyebrows raised .What is it that you suspect them of doing precisely ?I .theyre up to something !said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it .Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement trying to hide her sherry bottles and she heard Malfoy whooping celebrating !Hes trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me hes fixed it at last and youre about to just walk out of school without Enough said Dumbledore .He said it quite calmly and yet Harry fell silent at once he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line .Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year ?I have not .Tonight when I leave there will again be additional protection in place .Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously Harry .I didnt mumbled Harry a little abashed but Dumbledore cut across him .I do not wish to discuss the matter any further .Harry bit back his retort scared that he had gone too far that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore but Dumbledore went on Do you wish to come with me tonight ?Yes said Harry at once .Very well then Listen .Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height .I take you with me on one condition that you obey any command I might give you at once and without question .Of course .Be sure to understand me Harry .I mean that you must follow even such orders as ‘run ‘hide or ‘go back .Do I have your word ?I yes of course .If I tell you to hide you will do so ?Yes .If I tell you to flee you will obey ?Yes .If I tell you to leave me and save yourself you will do as I tell you ?Harry ?They looked at each other for a moment .Yes sir .Very good .Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes time .Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window the sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon .Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase .His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden .He knew what to do .Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back .What does he want ?Hermione said at once .Harry are you okay ?she added anxiously .Im fine said Harry shortly racing past them .He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauders Map and a pair of balledup socks .Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat looking stunned .Ive got to be quick Harry panted .Dumbledore thinks Im getting my Invisibility Cloak .Listen .Quickly he told them where he was going and why .He did not pause either for Hermione s gasps of horror or for Rons hasty questions they could work out the finer details for themselves later . .so you see what this means ?Harry finished at a gallop .Dumbledore wont be here tonight so Malfoys going to have another clear shot at whatever hes up to .No listen to me !he hissed angrily as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting .I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement .Here He shoved the Marauders Map into Hermiones hands .Youve got to watch him and youve got to watch Snape too .Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D .A .Hermione those contact Galleons will still work right ?Dumbledore says hes put extra protection in the school but if Snape s involved hell know what Dumbledore s protection is and how to avoid it but he wont be expecting you lot to be on the watch will he ?Harry began Hermione her eyes huge with fear .I havent got time to argue said Harry curtly .Take this as well He thrust the socks into Rons hands .Thanks said Ron .Er why do I need socks ?You need whats wrapped in them its the Felix Felicis .Share it between yourselves and Ginny too .Say goodbye to her for me .Id better go Dumbledore s waiting No !said Hermione as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion looking awestruck .We dont want it you take it who knows what youre going to be facing ?Ill be fine Ill be with Dumbledore said Harry .I want to know you lot are okay .Dont look like that Hermione Ill see you later .And he was off hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall .Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors .He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step panting hard a searing stitch in his side .I would like you to wear your cloak please said Dumbledore and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying Very good .Shall we go ?Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps his own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air .Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak still panting and sweating rather a lot .But what will people think when they see you leaving Professor ?Harry asked his mind on Malfoy and Snape .That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink said Dumbledore lightly .I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom or else visit the Hogs Head .or I appear to .It is as good a way as any of disguising ones true destination .They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight .The air was full of the smells of warm grass lake water and wood smoke from Hagrids cabin .It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening .Professor said Harry quietly as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view will we be Apparating ?Yes said Dumbledore .You can Apparate now I believe ?Yes said Harry but I havent got a license .He felt it best to be honest what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go ?No matter said Dumbledore I can assist you again .They turned out of the gates into the twilit deserted lane to Hogsmeade .Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest .Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting .and stay out !shouted Madam Rosmerta forcibly ejecting a grubbylooking wizard .Oh hello Albus .Youre out late .Good evening Rosmerta good evening .forgive me Im off to the Hogs Head .No offense but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight .A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hogs Heads sign creaked a little though there was no breeze .In contrast to the Three Broomsticks the pub appeared to be completely empty .It will not be necessary for us to enter muttered Dumbledore glancing around .As long as nobody sees us go .now place your hand upon my arm Harry .There is no need to grip too hard I am merely guiding you .On the count of three .One .two .three .Harry turned .At once there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube he could not draw breath every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then just when he thought he must suffocate the invisible bands seemed to burst open and he was standing in cool darkness breathing in lungfuls of fresh salty air .THE CAVE Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves a light chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and starstrewn sky .He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and churning below him .He glanced over his shoulder .A towering cliff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless .A few large chunks of rock such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past .It was a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand .What do you think ?asked Dumbledore .He might have been asking Harrys opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic .They brought the kids from the orphanage here ?asked Harry who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip .Not here precisely said Dumbledore .There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us .I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves .No I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot .No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers and boats cannot approach the cliffs the waters around them are too dangerous .I imagine that Riddle climbed down magic would have served better than ropes .And he brought two small children with him probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them .I think the journey alone would have done it dont you ?Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps .But his final destination and ours lies a little farther on .Come .Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay halfsubmerged in water and closer to the cliff .It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore hampered slightly by his withered hand moved slowly .The lower rocks were slippery with seawater .Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face .Lumos said Dumbledore as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face .A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too .You see ?said Dumbledore quietly holding his wand a little higher .Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling .You will not object to getting a little wet ?No said Harry .Then take off your Invisibility Cloak there is no need for it now and let us take the plunge .And with the sudden agility of a much younger man Dumbledore slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward the dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth .Harry pulled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed .The water was icy Harrys waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down .Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed he struck out for the shimmering shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff .The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide .The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore s wand .A little way in the passageway curved to the left and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff .He continued to swim in Dumbledore s wake the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough wet rock .Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead his silver hair and dark robes gleaming .When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave .He clambered up them water streaming from his soaking clothes and emerged shivering uncontrollably into the still and freezing air .Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot examining the walls and ceiling .Yes this is the place said Dumbledore .How can you tell ?Harry spoke in a whisper .It has known magic said Dumbledore simply .Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spinedeep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments .He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see .This is merely the antechamber the entrance hall said Dumbledore after a moment or two .We need to penetrate the inner place .Now it is Lord Voldemorts obstacles that stand in our way rather than those nature made .Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand .Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave touching as much of the rough rock as he could occasionally pausing running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot until finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall .Here he said .We go on through here .The entrance is concealed .Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew .He had never seen a wizard work things out like this simply by looking and touching but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise .Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock .For a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack .Youve ddone it !said Harry through chattering teeth but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever .Dumbledore looked around .Harry Im so sorry I forgot he said he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once Harrys clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire .Thank you said Harry gratefully but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall .He did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently as though something extremely interesting was written on it .Harry stayed quite still he did not want to break Dumbledores concentration .Then after two solid minutes Dumbledore said quietly Oh surely not .So crude .What is it Professor ?I rather think said Dumbledore putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients that we are required to make payment to pass .Payment ?said Harry .Youve got to give the door something ?Yes said Dumbledore .Blood if I am not much mistaken .Blood ?I said it was crude said Dumbledore who sounded disdainful even disappointed as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected .The idea as I am sure you will have gathered is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter .Once again Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury .Yeah but still if you can avoid it .said Harry who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more .Sometimes however it is unavoidable said Dumbledore shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand .Professor !protested Harry hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife .Ill do it Im He did not know what he was going to say younger fitter ?But Dumbledore merely smiled .There was a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face was peppered with dark glistening drops .You are very kind Harry said Dumbledore now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm so that it healed instantly just as Snape had healed Malfoys wounds .But your blood is worth more than mine .Ah that seems to have done the trick doesnt it ?The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more and this time it did not fade away The bloodspattered rock within it simply vanished leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness .After me I think said Dumbledore and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels lighting his own wand hastily as he went .An eerie sight met their eyes They were standing on the edge of a great black lake so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight .A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake it was reflected in the completely still water below .The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected .The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness .Let us walk said Dumbledore quietly .Be very careful not to step into the water .Stay close to me .He set off around the edge of the lake and Harry followed close behind him .Their footsteps made echoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water .On and on they walked but the view did not vary on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the boundless expanse of smooth glassy blackness in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow .Harry found the place and the silence oppressive unnerving .Professor ?he said finally .Do you think the Horcrux is here ?Oh yes said Dumbledore .Yes Im sure it is .The question is how do we get to it ?We couldnt .we couldnt just try a Summoning Charm ?Harry said sure that it was a stupid suggestion .But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible .Certainly we could said Dumbledore stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him .Why dont you do it ?Me ?Oh .okay .Harry had not expected this but cleared his throat and said loudly wand aloft Accio Horcruxl With a noise like an explosion something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away before Harry could see what it was it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great deep ripples on the mirrored surface .Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore .What was that ?Something I think that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux .Harry looked back at the water .The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast Harrys heart however was still pounding .Did you think that would happen sir ?I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux .That was a very good idea Harry much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing .But we dont know what the thing was said Harry looking at the sinisterly smooth water .What the things are you mean said Dumbledore .I doubt very much that there is only one of them .Shall we walk on ?Professor ?Yes Harry ?Do you think were going to have to go into the lake ?Into it ?Only if we are very unfortunate .You dont think the Horcrux is at the bottom ?Oh no .I think the Horcrux is in the middle .And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake .So were going to have to cross the lake to get to it ?Yes I think so .Harry did not say anything .His thoughts were all of water monsters of giant serpents of demons kelpies and sprites .Aha said Dumbledore and he stopped again this time Harry really did walk into him for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and Dumbledores uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm pulling him back .So sorry Harry I should have given warning .Stand back against the wall please I think I have found the place .Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it .This time he was running his hand not over the rocky wall but through the thin air as though expecting to find and grip something invisible .Oho said Dumbledore happily seconds later .His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see .Dumbledore moved closer to the water Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim .Keeping his hand clenched in midair Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point .Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore s clenched hand .Dumbledore tapped the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls pulling something from the depths of the black water .Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface glowing as green as the chain and floated with barely a ripple toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood .How did you know that was there ?Harry asked in astonishment .Magic always leaves traces said Dumbledore as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive traces .I taught Tom Riddle .I know his style .Is .is this boat safe ?Oh yes I think so .Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux .So the things in the water wont do anything to us if we cross in Voldemorts boat ?I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not Lord Voldemort .Thus far however we have done well .They have allowed us to raise the boat .But why have they let us ?asked Harry who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank .Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat said Dumbledore .I think he would have been prepared to risk what was to his mind the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate .We shall see whether he is right .Harry looked down into the boat .It really was very small .It doesnt look like it was built for two people .Will it hold both of us ?Will we be too heavy together ?Dumbledore chuckled .Voldemort will not have cared about the weight but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake .I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it .But then ?I do not think you will count Harry You are underage and unqualified .Voldemort would never have expected a sixteenyearold to reach this place I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine .These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale perhaps Dumbledore knew it for he added Voldemorts mistake Harry Voldemorts mistake .Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth .Now you first this time and be careful not to touch the water .Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat .Dumbledore stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor .They were crammed in together Harry could not comfortably sit but crouched his knees jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once .There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boats prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center .Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no waves .Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed .The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface grooves in the dark mirror .And then Harry saw it marble white floating inches below the surface .Professor !he said and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water .Harry ?I think I saw a hand in the water a human hand !Yes I am sure you did said Dumbledore calmly .Harry stared down into the water looking for the vanished hand and a sick feeling rose in his throat .So that thing that jumped out of the water ?But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him this time a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke .There are bodies in here !said Harry and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own .Yes said Dumbledore placidly but we do not need to worry about them at the moment .At the moment ?Harry repeated tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore .Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us said Dumbledore .There is nothing to be feared from a body Harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness .Lord Voldemort who of course secretly fears both disagrees .But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom .It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more .Harry said nothing he did not want to argue but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and what was more he did not believe that they were not dangerous .But one of them jumped he said trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore s .When I tried to Summon the Horcrux a body leapt out of the lake .Yes said Dumbledore .I am sure that once we take the Horcrux we shall find them less peaceable .However like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness they fear light and warmth which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise .Fire Harry Dumbledore added with a smile in response to Harrys bewildered expression .Oh .right .said Harry quickly .He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing .He could not pretend now that he was not scared .The great black lake teeming with the dead .It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis .He suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to them .and he hadnt seen Ginny at all .Nearly there said Dumbledore cheerfully .Sure enough the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last and within minutes the boat had come to a halt bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake .Careful not to touch the water said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat .The island was no larger than Dumbledore s office an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light which looked much brighter when viewed close to .Harry squinted at it at first he thought it was a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve which was set on top of a pedestal .Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed .Side by side they looked down into it .The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow .What is it ?asked Harry quietly .I am not sure said Dumbledore .Something more worrisome than blood and bodies however .Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion .Sir no dont touch !I cannot touch said Dumbledore smiling faintly .See ?I cannot approach any nearer than this .You try .Staring Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion .He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it .No matter how hard he pushed his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air .Out of the way please Harry said Dumbledore .He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion murmuring soundlessly .Nothing happened except perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter .Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand and Harry felt it was safe to talk again .You think the Horcrux is in there sir ?Oh yes .Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin .Harry saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion .But how to reach it ?This potion cannot be penetrated by hand Vanished parted scooped up or siphoned away nor can it be Transfigured Charmed or otherwise made to change its nature .Almost absentmindedly Dumbledore raised his wand again twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere .I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk .What ?said Harry .No !Yes I think so Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths .But what if what if it kills you ?Oh I doubt that it would work like that said Dumbledore easily .Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island .Harry couldnt believe it .Was this more of Dumbledore s insane determination to see good in everyone ?Sir said Harry trying to keep his voice reasonable sir this is Voldemort were Im sorry Harry I should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island Dumbledore corrected himself .He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and most importantly of all why they were so intent upon emptying the basin .Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes .Harry made to speak again but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard .Undoubtedly he said finally this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux .It might paralyze me cause me to forget what I am here for create so much pain I am distracted or render me incapable in some other way .This being the case Harry it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth .You understand ?Their eyes met over the basin each pale face lit with that strange green light .Harry did not speak .Was this why he had been invited along so that he could forcefeed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain ?You remember said Dumbledore the condition on which I brought you with me ?Harry hesitated looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin .But what if ?You swore did you not to follow any command I gave you ?Yes but I warned you did I not that there might be danger ?Yes said Harry but Well then said Dumbledore shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet you have my orders .Why cant I drink the potion instead ?asked Harry desperately .Because I am much older much cleverer and much less valuable said Dumbledore .Once and for all Harry do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking ?Couldnt ?Do I have it ?But Your word Harry .I all right but Before Harry could make any further protest Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion .For a split second Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had when the glass was full to the brim Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth .Your good health Harry .And he drained the goblet .Harry watched terrified his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb .Professor ?he said anxiously as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass .How do you feel ?Dumbledore shook his head his eyes closed .Harry wondered whether he was in pain .Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin refilled it and drank once more .In silence Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion .Then halfway through the fourth goblet he staggered and fell forward against the basin .His eyes were still closed his breathing heavy .Professor Dumbledore ?said Harry his voice strained .Can you hear me ?Dumbledore did not answer .His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream .His grip on the goblet was slackening the potion was about to spill from it .Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup holding it steady .Professor can you hear me ?he repeated loudly his voice echoing around the cavern .Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this .I dont want .Dont make me .Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well at the crooked nose and halfmoon spectacles and did not know what to do . .dont like .want to stop .moaned Dumbledore .You .you cant stop Professor said Harry .Youve got to keep drinking remember ?You told me you had to keep drinking .Here .Hating himself repulsed by what he was doing Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore s mouth and tipped it so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside .No .he groaned as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him .I dont want to . .I dont want to .Let me go .Its all right Professor said Harry his hand shaking .Its all right Im here Make it stop make it stop moaned Dumbledore .Yes .yes thisll make it stop lied Harry .He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledore s open mouth .Dumbledore screamed the noise echoed all around the vast chamber across the dead black water .No no no no I cant I cant dont make me I dont want to .Its all right Professor its all right !said Harry loudly his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion the basin was now half empty .Nothings happening to you youre safe it isnt real I swear it isnt real take this now take this .And obediently Dumbledore drank as though it was an antidote Harry offered him but upon draining the goblet he sank to his knees shaking uncontrollably .Its all my fault all my fault he sobbed .Please make it stop I know I did wrong oh please make it stop and Ill never never again .This will make it stop Professor Harry said his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledores mouth .Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harrys trembling hands as he moaned Dont hurt them dont hurt them please please its my fault hurt me instead .Here drink this drink this youll be all right said Harry desperately and once again Dumbledore obeyed him opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot .And now he fell forward screaming again hammering his fists upon the ground while Harry filled the ninth goblet .Please please please no .not that not that Ill do anything .Just drink Professor just drink .Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst but when he had finished he yelled again as though his insides were on fire .No more please no more .Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin .Were nearly there Professor .Drink this drink it .He supported Dumbledores shoulders and again Dumbledore drained the glass then Harry was on his feet once more refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever I want to die !I want to die !Make it stop make it stop I want to die !Drink this Professor .Drink this .Dumbledore drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled KILL ME !This this one will !gasped Harry .Just drink this .Itll be over .all over !Dumbledore gulped at the goblet drained every last drop and then with a great rattling gasp rolled over onto his face .No !shouted Harry who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down beside Dumbledore and heaved him over onto his back Dumbledores glasses were askew his mouth agape his eyes closed .No said Harry shaking Dumbledore no youre not dead you said it wasnt poison wake up wake up Rennervatel he cried his wand pointing at Dumbledores chest there was a flash of red light but nothing happened .Renneruate sir please Dumbledores eyelids flickered Harrys heart leapt .Sir are you ?Water croaked Dumbledore .Water panted Harry .Yes He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it .Aguamenti he shouted jabbing the goblet with his wand .The goblet filled with clear water Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore raised his head and brought the glass to his lips but it was empty .Dumbledore groaned and began to pant .But I had some wait AguamentiV said Harry again pointing his wand at the goblet .Once more for a second clear water gleamed within it but as he approached Dumbledore s mouth the water vanished again .Sir Im trying Im trying !said Harry desperately but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great rattling breaths that sounded agonizing .Aguamenti Aguamenti A GUAMENTP .The goblet filled and emptied once more .And now Dumbledore s breathing was fading .His brain whirling in panic Harry knew instinctively the only way left to get water because Voldemort had planned it so .He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish .Sir here !Harry yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face .It was the best he could do for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water .A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him slowly backward across the rock .The surface of the lake was no longer mirrorsmooth it was churning and everywhere Harry looked white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water men and women and children with sunken sightless eyes were moving toward the rock an army of the dead rising from the black water .Petrificus Totalusl yelled Harry struggling to cling to the smooth soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm It released him falling backward into the water with a splash he scrambled to his feet but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface their blank frosted eyes upon him trailing waterlogged rags sunken faces leering .Petrificus Totalusl Harry bellowed again backing away as he swiped his wand through the air six or seven of them crumpled but more were coming toward him .Impedimental Incarcerousl A few of them stumbled one or two of them bound in ropes but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies .Still slashing at the air with his wand Harry yelled Sectumsempral SECTUMSEMPRAl But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin they had no blood to spill They walked on unfeeling their shrunken hands outstretched toward him and as he backed away still farther he felt arms enclose him from behind thin fleshless arms cold as death and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him slowly and surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul .But then through the darkness fire erupted crimson and gold a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water .They dropped Harry he hit the ground slipped on the rock and fell grazing his arms but scrambled back up raising his wand and staring around .Dumbledore was on his feet again pale as any of the surrounding Inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eyes his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames like a vast lasso encircling them all with warmth .The Inferi bumped into each other attempting blindly to escape the fire in which they were enclosed .Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes .Wordlessly he gestured to Harry to come to his side .Distracted by the flames the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat the ring of fire moving with them around them the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the waters edge where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters .Harry who was shaking all over thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat he staggered a little as he attempted it all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them .Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat .Once they were both safely jammed inside again the boat began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface .Sir panted Harry sir I forgot about fire they were coming at me and I panicked Quite understandable murmured Dumbledore .Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was .They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out then turned quickly to help Dumbledore .The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall the ring of fire vanished but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water .The little boat sank into the water once more clanking and tinkling its chain slithered back into the lake too .Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall .I am weak .he said .Dont worry sir said Harry at once anxious about Dumbledore s extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion .Dont worry Ill get us back .Lean on me sir .And pulling Dumbledore s uninjured arm around his shoulders Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake bearing most of his weight .The protection was .after all .welldesigned said Dumbledore faintly .One alone could not have done it .You did well very well Harry .Dont talk now said Harry fearing how slurred Dumbledores voice had become how much his feet dragged .Save your energy sir .Well soon be out of here .The archway will have sealed again .My knife .Theres no need I got cut on the rock said Harry firmly .Just tell me where .Here .Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone Having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly .They crossed the outer cave and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff .Its going to be all right sir Harry said over and over again more worried by Dumbledores silence than he had been by his weakened voice .Were nearly there .I can Apparate us both back .Dont worry .I am not worried Harry said Dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water .I am with you .THE LIGHTNINGSTRUCK TOWER Once back under the starry sky Harry heaved Dumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet .Sodden and shivering Dumbledores weight still upon him Harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination Hogsmeade .Closing his eyes gripping Dumbledores arm as tightly as he could he stepped forward into that feeling of horrible compression .He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes The smell of salt the sea breeze had gone .He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade .For one horrible moment Harrys imagination showed him more Inferi creeping toward him around the sides of shops but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring all was still the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows .We did it Professor !Harry whispered with difficulty he suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest .We did it !We got the Horcrux !Dumbledore staggered against him .For a moment Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off balance then he saw his face paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp .Sir are you all right ?Ive been better said Dumbledore weakly though the corners of his mouth twitched .That potion .was no health drink .And to Harrys horror Dumbledore sank onto the ground .Sir its okay sir youre going to be all right dont worry He looked around desperately for help but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing .We need to get you up to the school sir .Madam Pomfrey .No said Dumbledore .It is .Professor Snape whom I need .But I do not think .I can walk very far just yet .Right sir listen Im going to knock on a door find a place you can stay then I can run and get Madam Severus said Dumbledore clearly .I need Severus .All right then Snape but Im going to have to leave you for a moment so I can Before Harry could make a move however he heard running footsteps .His heart leapt Somebody had seen somebody knew they needed help and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street toward them on highheeled fluffy slippers wearing a silk dressing gown embroidered with dragons .I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains !Thank goodness thank goodness I couldnt think what to but whats wrong with Albus ?She came to a halt panting and stared down wide eyed at Dumbledore .Hes hurt said Harry .Madam Rosmerta can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him ?You cant go up there alone !Dont you realize havent you seen ?If you help me support him said Harry not listening to her I think we can get him inside What has happened ?asked Dumbledore .Rosmerta whats wrong ?The the Dark Mark Albus .And she pointed into the sky in the direction of Hogwarts .Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words .He turned and looked .There it was hanging in the sky above the school the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building .wherever they had murdered .When did it appear ?asked Dumbledore and his hand clenched painfully upon Harrys shoulder as he struggled to his feet .Must have been minutes ago it wasnt there when I put the cat out but when I got upstairs We need to return to the castle at once said Dumbledore .Rosmerta and though he staggered a little he seemed wholly in command of the situation we need transport brooms Ive got a couple behind the bar she said looking very frightened .Shall I run and fetch ?No Harry can do it .Harry raised his wand at once .Accio Rosmertas Broomsl A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harrys side where they stopped dead quivering slightly at waist height .Rosmerta please send a message to the Ministry said Dumbledore as he mounted the broom nearest him .It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong .Harry put on your Invisibility Cloak .Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air .As they sped toward the castle Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore ready to grab him should he fall but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant He was bent low over his broom his eyes fixed upon the Mark his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air .And Harry too looked ahead at the skull and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble compressing his lungs driving all other discomfort from his mind .How long had they been away ?Had Ron Hermione and Ginnys luck run out by now ?Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school or was it Neville or Luna or some other member of the D .A .And if it was .he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds .Would he be responsible again for the death of a friend ?As they flew over the dark twisting lane down which they had walked earlier Harry heard over the whistling of the night air in his ears Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again .He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed .The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower the highest of the castle .Did that mean the death had occurred there ?Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around .The ramparts were deserted .The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed .There was no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body .What does it mean ?Harry asked Dumbledore looking up at the green skull with its serpents tongue glinting evilly above them .Is it the real Mark ?Has someone definitely been Professor ?In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand .Go and wake Severus said Dumbledore faintly but clearly .Tell him what has happened and bring him to me .Do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak .I shall wait here .But You swore to obey me Harry go !Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side .He looked around at Dumbledore who gestured him to retreat .Harry backed away drawing his wand as he did so .The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted Expelliarmus Harrys body became instantly rigid and immobile and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall propped like an unsteady statue unable to move or speak .He could not understand how it had happened Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm Then by the light of the Mark he saw Dumbledore s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood .Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized Harry and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself .Standing against the ramparts very white in the face Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress .He merely looked across at his disarmer and said Good evening Draco .Malfoy stepped forward glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone .His eyes fell upon the second broom .Who else is here ?A question I might ask you .Or are you acting alone ?Harry saw Malfoys pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark .No he said .Ive got backup .There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight .Well well said Dumbledore as though Malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project .Very good indeed .You found a way to let them in did you ?Yeah said Malfoy who was panting .Right under your nose and you never realized !Ingenious said Dumbledore .Yet .forgive me .where are they now ?You seem unsupported .They met some of your guards .Theyre having a fight down below .They wont be long .I came on ahead .I Ive got a job to do .Well then you must get on and do it my dear boy said Dumbledore softly .There was silence .Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible paralyzed body staring at the two of them his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters distant fight and in front of him Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who incredibly smiled .Draco Draco you are not a killer .How do you know ?said Malfoy at once .He seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded Harry saw him flush in the Marks greenish light .You dont know what Im capable of said Malfoy more forcefully .You dont know what Ive done !Oh yes I do said Dumbledore mildly .You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley .You have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year .Forgive me Draco but they have been feeble attempts .So feeble to be honest that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it .It has been in it !said Malfoy vehemently .Ive been working on it all year and tonight Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell .Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder .Somebody is putting up a good fight said Dumbledore conversationally .But you were saying .yes you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school which I admit I thought impossible . .How did you do it ?But Malfoy said nothing He was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as Harry was .Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone suggested Dumbledore .What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard ?As you have perhaps realized there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too .And after all you dont really need help .I have no wand at the moment .I cannot defend myself .Malfoy merely stared at him .I see said Dumbledore kindly when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke .You are afraid to act until they join you .Im not afraid !snarled Malfoy though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore .Its you who should be scared !But why ?I dont think you will kill me Draco .Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe .So tell me while we wait for your friends .how did you smuggle them in here ?It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it .Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit .He gulped and took several deep breaths glaring at Dumbledore his wand pointing directly at the latters heart .Then as though he could not help himself he said I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no ones used for years .The one Montague got lost in last year .aah .Dumbledores sigh was half a groan .He closed his eyes for a moment .That was clever .There is a pair I take it ?In Borgin and Burkes said Malfoy and they make a kind of passage between them .Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school and sometimes what was going on in the shop as if the cabinet was traveling between them but he couldnt make anyone hear him .In the end he managed to Apparate out even though hed never passed his test .He nearly died doing it .Everyone thought it was a really good story but I was the only one who realized what it meant even Borgin didnt know I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one .Very good murmured Dumbledore .So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you .A clever plan a very clever plan .and as you say right under my nose .Yeah said Malfoy who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledores praise .Yeah it was !But there were times Dumbledore went on werent there when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet ?And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands .poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink .Yeah well you still didnt realize who was behind that stuff did you ?sneered Malfoy as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts the strength in his legs apparently fading and Harry struggled fruitlessly mutely against the enchantment binding him .As a matter of fact I did said Dumbledore .I was sure it was you .Why didnt you stop me then ?Malfoy demanded .I tried Draco .Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders He hasnt been doing your orders he promised my mother Of course that is what he would tell you Draco but Hes a double agent you stupid old man he isnt working for you you just think he is !We must agree to differ on that Draco .It so happens that I trust Professor Snape Well youre losing your grip then !sneered Malfoy .Hes been offering me plenty of help wanting all the glory for himself wanting a bit of the action What are you doing ? ‘Did you do the necklace that was stupid it could have blown everything But I havent told him what Ive been doing in the Room of Requirement hes going to wake up tomorrow and itll all be over and he wont be the Dark Lords favorite anymore hell be nothing compared to me nothing !Very gratifying said Dumbledore mildly .We all like appreciation for our own hard work of course .But you must have had an accomplice all the same .someone in Hogsmeade someone who was able to slip Katie the the aah .Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded as though he was about to fall asleep .of course .Rosmerta .How long has she been under the Imperius Curse ?Got there at last have you ?Malfoy taunted .There was another yell from below rather louder than the last .Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again then back at Dumbledore who went on So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied ?And the poisoned mead .well naturally Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn believing that it was to be my Christmas present .Yes very neat .very neat .Poor Mr Filch would not of course think to check a bottle of Rosmertas .Tell me how have you been communicating with Rosmerta ?I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored .Enchanted coins said Malfoy as though he was compelled to keep talking though his wand hand was shaking badly .I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages Isnt that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore s Army used last year ?asked Dumbledore .His voice was light and conversational but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it .Yeah I got the idea from them said Malfoy with a twisted smile .I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions .Please do not use that offensive word in front of me said Dumbledore .Malfoy gave a harsh laugh .You care about me saying ‘Mudblood when Im about to kill you ?Yes I do said Dumbledore and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright .But as for being about to kill me Draco you have had several long minutes now we are quite alone I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me and still you have not acted .Malfoys mouth contorted involuntarily as though he had tasted something very bitter .Now about tonight Dumbledore went on I am a little puzzled about how it happened .You knew that I had left the school ?But of course he answered his own question Rosmerta saw me leaving she tipped you off using your ingenious coins Im sure .Thats right said Malfoy .But she said you were just going for a drink youd be back .Well I certainly did have a drink .and I came back .after a fashion mumbled Dumbledore .So you decided to spring a trap for me ?We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see whod been killed said Malfoy .And it worked !Well .yes and no .said Dumbledore .But am I to take it then that nobody has been murdered ?Someones dead said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it .One of your people .I dont know who it was dark .I stepped over the body .I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back only your Phoenix lot got in the way .Yes they do that said Dumbledore .There was a bang and shouts from below louder than ever it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore Malfoy and Harry stood and Harrys heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest .Someone was dead . .Malfoy had stepped over the body .but who was it ?There is little time one way or another said Dumbledore .So let us discuss your options Draco .My options !said Malfoy loudly .Im standing here with a wand Im about to kill you My dear boy let us have no more pretense about that .If you were going to kill me you would have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means .I havent got any options !said Malfoy and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore .Ive got to do it !Hell kill me !Hell kill my whole family !I appreciate the difficulty of your position said Dumbledore .Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now ?Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you .Malfoy winced at the sound of the name .I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted in case he used Legilimency against you continued Dumbledore .But now at last we can speak plainly to each other . .No harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived .I can help you Draco .No you cant said Malfoy his wand hand shaking very badly indeed .Nobody can .He told me to do it or hell kill me .Ive got no choice .Come over to the right side Draco and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine .What is more I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise .Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban .When the time comes we can protect him too .Come over to the right side Draco .you are not a killer .Malfoy stared at Dumbledore .But I got this far didnt I ?he said slowly .They thought Id die in the attempt but Im here .and youre in my power .Im the one with the wand .Youre at my mercy .No Draco said Dumbledore quietly .It is my mercy and not yours that matters now .Malfoy did not speak .His mouth was open his wand hand still trembling .Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts .Still paralyzed his eyes staring unblinkingly Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers It seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below .A lumpylooking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle .Dumbledore cornered !he said and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly .Dumbledore wandless Dumbledore alone !Well done Draco well done !Good evening Amycus said Dumbledore calmly as though welcoming the man to a tea party .And youve brought Alecto too .Charming .The woman gave an angry little titter .Think your little jokesll help you on your deathbed then ?she jeered .Jokes ?No no these are manners replied Dumbledore .Do it said the stranger standing nearest to Harry a big rangy man with matted gray hair and whiskers whose black Death Eaters robes looked uncomfortably tight .He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard a rasping bark of a voice .Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt sweat and unmistakably of blood coming from him .His filthy hands had long yellowish nails .Is that you Fenrir ?asked Dumbledore .Thats right rasped the other .Pleased to see me Dumbledore ?No I cannot say that I am .Greyback grinned showing pointed teeth .Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly obscenely .But you know how much I like kids Dumbledore .Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now ?This is most unusual .You have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month ?Thats right said Fenrir Greyback .Shocks you that does it Dumbledore ?Frightens you ?Well I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little said Dumbledore .And yes I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you of all people into the school where his friends live .I didnt breathed Malfoy .He was not looking at Fenrir he did not seem to want to even glance at him .I didnt know he was going to come I wouldnt want to miss a trip to Hogwarts Dumbledore rasped Greyback .Not when there are throats to be ripped out .Delicious delicious .And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth leering at Dumbledore .I could do you for afters Dumbledore .No said the fourth Death Eater sharply .He had a heavy brutallooking face .Weve got orders .Dracos got to do it .Now Draco and quickly .Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever .He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore s face which was even paler and rather lower than usual as he had slid so far down the rampart wall .Hes not long for this world anyway if you ask me !said the lopsided man to the accompaniment of his sisters wheezing giggles .Look at him whats happened to you then Dumby ?Oh weaker resistance slower reflexes Amycus said Dumbledore .Old age in short .One day perhaps it will happen to you .if you are lucky .Whats that mean then whats that mean ?yelled the Death Eater suddenly violent .Always the same werent yeh Dumby talking and doing nothing nothing .I dont even know why the Dark Lords bothering to kill yer !Come on Draco do it !But at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted Theyve blocked the stairs Reductol REDUCTOl Harrys heart leapt So these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it created a barrier behind them Now Draco quickly !said the brutalfaced man angrily .But Malfoys hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim .Ill do it snarled Fenrir moving toward Dumbledore with his hands outstretched his teeth bared .I said no !shouted the brutalfaced man there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way he hit the ramparts and staggered looking furious .Harrys heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there imprisoned by Dumbledore s spell if he could only move he could aim a curse from under the cloak Draco do it or stand aside so one of us screeched the woman but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene from Dumbledore slumped against the wall to the four Death Eaters including the enraged werewolf and Malfoy .Weve got a problem Snape said the lumpy Amycus whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore the boy doesnt seem able But somebody else had spoken Snapes name quite softly .Severus .The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening .For the first time Dumbledore was pleading .Snape said nothing but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way .The three Death Eaters fell back without a word .Even the werewolf seemed cowed .Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face .Severus .please .Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore .Avada KedavraV A jet of green light shot from the end of Snapes wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest .Harrys scream of horror never left him silent and unmoving he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air .For a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull and then he fell slowly backward like a great rag doll over the battlements and out of sight .FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space it had not happened .It could not have happened .Out of here quickly said Snape .He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed the latter both panting excitedly .As they vanished through the door Harry realized he could move again .What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic but horror and shock .He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutalfaced Death Eater last to leave the tower top was disappearing through the door .Petrificus Totalusl The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground rigid as a waxwork but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase .Terror tore at Harrys heart .He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape .Somehow the two things were linked .He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together .Dumbledore could not have died .He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed his wand raised The dimly lit corridor was full of dust half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle was raging before him but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom he heard the hated voice shout Its over time to go and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed .As Harry plunged after them one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him It was the werewolf Fenrir .He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand Harry fell backward with filthy matted hair in his face the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth hot greedy breath at his throat Petrificus Totalusl Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him he ducked and ran headfirst into the fight .His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled There were two bodies lying there lying facedown in a pool of blood but there was no time to investigate .Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater Amycus who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them Amycus was giggling enjoying the sport Crucio Crucio you cant dance forever pretty Impedimenta .yelled Harry .His jinx hit Amycus in the chest He gave a piglike squeal of pain was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall slid down it and fell out of sight behind Ron Professor McGonagall and Lupin each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater .Beyond them Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions so that they ricocheted off the walls around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window Harry where did you come from ?Ginny cried but there was no time to answer her .He put his head down and sprinted forward narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head showering them all in bits of wall .Snape must not escape he must catch up with Snape Take that shouted Professor McGonagall and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater Alecto sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head her brother right behind her .He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something and next moment he was lying across someones legs .Looking around he saw Nevilles pale round face flat against the floor .Neville are you ?Mall right muttered Neville who was clutching his stomach Harry .Snape n Malfoy .ran past .I know Im on it !said Harry aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos .The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face He wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister .Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him the yells of the others to come back and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know .He skidded around the corner his trainers slippery with blood Snape had an immense head start .Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement or had the Order made steps to secure it to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way ?He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded .He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing who ran screeching into neighboring paintings .As he leapt the wreckage of armor Harry heard more shouts and screams other people within the castle seemed to have awoken .He pelted toward a shortcut hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy who must surely have reached the grounds by now .Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajamaclad Hufflepuffs stood .Harry !We heard a noise and someone said something about the Dark Mark began Ernie Macmillan .Out of the way !yelled Harry knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase .The oak front doors had been blasted open there were smears of blood on the flagstones and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces .The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse and the rubies within were still falling with a loud rattle onto the flagstones below .Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate by the looks of them the huge blond Death Eater and some way ahead of him Snape and Malfoy .The cold night air ripped at Harrys lungs as he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry .He did not know what it was but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse Another flash shouts retaliatory jets of light and Harry understood Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said not Hagrid .not Hagrid too .Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostrils He knew even as he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him .Impedimenta .he yelled as he rolled over again crouching close to the dark ground and miraculously his jinx hit one of them who stumbled and fell tripping up the other Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape .And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper but Hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him .Snape and Malfoy however were still running they would soon be beyond the gates able to Disapparate Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent took aim at Snapes back and yelled Stupefy He missed the jet of red light soared past Snapes head Snape shouted Run Draco and turned .Twenty yards apart he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously .Cruc But Snape parried the curse knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled Incendiol Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them Hagrids house was on fire .Fangs in there yer evil !Hagrid bellowed .Cruc yelled Harry for the second time aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight but Snape blocked the spell again .Harry could see him sneering .No Unforgivable Curses from you Potter !he shouted over the rushing of the flames Hagrids yells and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang .You havent got the nerve or the ability Incarc Harry roared but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm .Fight back !Harry screamed at him .Fight back you cowardly Coward did you call me Potter ?shouted Snape .Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one what would you call him I wonder ?Stupe Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed Potter !sneered Snape deflecting the curse once more .Now come !he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry .It is time to be gone before the Ministry turns up Impedi But before he could finish this jinx excruciating pain hit Harry he keeled over in the grass .Someone was screaming he would surely die of this agony Snape was going to torture him to death or madness No !roared Snapes voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started Harry lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead Snape was shouting Have you forgotten our orders ?Potter belongs to the Dark Lord we are to leave him !Go !Go !And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed running toward the gates .Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage In that instant he cared not whether he lived or died .Pushing himself to his feet again he staggered blindly toward Snape the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself Sectum !Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snapes face clearly at last He was no longer sneering or jeering the blazing flames showed a face full of rage .Mustering all his powers of concentration Harry thought Levi No Potter !screamed Snape .There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward hitting the ground hard again and this time his wand flew out of his hand .He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been .Snapes pale face illuminated by the flaming cabin was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore .You dare use my own spells against me Potter ?It was I who invented them I the HalfBlood Prince !And youd turn my inventions on me like your filthy father would you ?I dont think so .no !Harry had dived for his wand Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight .Kill me then panted Harry who felt no fear at all but only rage and contempt .Kill me like you killed him you coward DONT screamed Snape and his face was suddenly demented inhuman as though he was in as much pain as the yelping howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them CALL ME COWARD !And he slashed at the air Harry felt a whitehot whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground .Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars .Buckbeak had flown at Snape who staggered backward as the razorsharp claws slashed at him .As Harry raised himself into a sitting position his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground he saw Snape running as hard as he could the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech Harry struggled to his feet looking around groggily for his wand hoping to give chase again but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass discarding twigs he knew it would be too late and sure enough by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates .Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the schools boundaries .Hagrid muttered Harry still dazed looking around .HAGRID ?He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back .With a cry of thankfulness Harry sank to his knees he was shaking in every limb his body ached all over and his breath came in painful stabs .Yeh all righ Harry ?Yeh all righ ?Speak ter me Harry .Hagrids huge hairy face was swimming above Harry blocking out the stars .Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt Fangs reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him .Im all right panted Harry .Are you ?Course I am .take moren that ter finish me .Hagrid put his hands under Harrys arms and raised him up with such force that Harrys feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again .He could see blood trickling down Hagrids cheek from a deep cut under one eye which was swelling rapidly .We should put out your house said Harry the charms ‘Aguamenti .Knew it was summat like that mumbled Hagrid and he raised a smoldering pink flowery umbrella and said Aguamenti A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip .Harry raised his wand arm which felt like lead and murmured Aguamenti too Together he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished .Snot too bad said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later looking at the smoking wreck .Nothin Dumbledore won be able to put righ .Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name .In the silence and the stillness horror rose inside him .Hagrid .I was bindin up a couple o bowtruckle legs when I heard em cornin said Hagrid sadly still staring at his wrecked cabin .Theyllve bin burnt ter twigs poor little things .Hagrid .But what happened Harry ?I jus saw them Death Eaters runnin down from the castle but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin with em ?Wheres he gone was he chasin them ?He .Harry cleared his throat it was dry from panic and the smoke .Hagrid he killed .Killed ?said Hagrid loudly staring down at Harry .Snape killed ?Whatre yeh on abou Harry ?Dumbledore said Harry .Snape killed .Dumbledore .Hagrid simply looked at him the little of his face that could be seen completely blank uncomprehending .Dumbledore wha Harry ?Hes dead .Snape killed him .Don say that said Hagrid roughly .Snape kill Dumbledore don be stupid Harry .Whas made yeh say tha ?I saw it happen .Yeh couldn have .I saw it Hagrid .Hagrid shook his head his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head that he was confused perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx .What musta happened was Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters Hagrid said confidently .I suppose hes gotta keep his cover .Look lets get yeh back up ter the school .Come on Harry .Harry did not attempt to argue or explain .He was still shaking uncontrollably .Hagrid would find out soon enough too soon .As they directed their steps back toward the castle Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now .He could imagine clearly the scenes inside as people moved from room to room telling each other that Death Eaters had got in that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts that somebody must have been killed .The oak front doors stood open ahead of them light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn .Slowly uncertainly dressinggowned people were creeping down the steps looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night .Harrys eyes however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower .He imagined that he could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort .Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore s body must lie however he saw people beginning to move toward it .Whatre they all lookin at ?said Hagrid as he and Harry approached the castle front Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles .Whas tha lyin on the grass ?Hagrid added sharply heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower where a small crowd was congregating .See it Harry ?Righ at the foot o the tower ?Under where the Mark .Blimey .yeh don think someone got thrown ?Hagrid fell silent the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud .Harry walked alongside him feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him though in an oddly detached way as though somebody near him was suffering them .What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest .He and Hagrid moved dreamlike through the murmuring crowd to the very front where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap .Harry heard Hagrid s moan of pain and shock but he did not stop he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him .He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full BodyBind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead but there was still no preparation for seeing him here spreadeagled broken the greatest wizard Harry had ever or would ever meet .Dumbledores eyes were closed but for the strange angle of his arms and legs he might have been sleeping .Harry reached out straightened the half moon spectacles upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve .Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth that never again would Dumbledore speak to him never again could he help .The crowd murmured behind Harry .After what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down .The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledores pocket .It had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground .And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already Harry knew as he picked it up that there was something wrong .He turned the locket over in his hands .This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve nor were there any markings upon it no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark .Moreover there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been .Automatically without really thinking about what he was doing Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment opened it and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him To the Dark Lord I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can .I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more .R .A .B .Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant .Only one thing mattered This was not a Horcrux .Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing .Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl .z ?THE PHOENIX LAMENT Cmere Harry .No .Yeh can stay here Harry .Come on now .No .He did not want to leave Dumbledores side he did not want to move anywhere .Hagrids hand on his shoulder was trembling .Then another voice said Harry come on .A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward .He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it .Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize from a trace of flowery scent on the air that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle .Incomprehensible voices battered him sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night but Harry and Ginny walked on back up the steps into the entrance hall .Faces swam on the edges of Harrys vision people were peering at him whispering wondering and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase .Were going to the hospital wing said Ginny .Im not hurt said Harry .Its McGonagalls orders said Ginny .Everyones up there Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone Fear stirred in Harrys chest again He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind .Ginny who else is dead ?Dont worry none of us .But the Dark Mark Malfoy said he stepped over a body He stepped over Bill but its all right hes alive .There was something in her voice however that Harry knew boded ill .Are you sure ?Of course Im sure .hes a a bit of a mess thats all .Greyback attacked him .Madam Pomfrey says he wont wont look the same anymore .Ginny s voice trembled a little .We dont really know what the aftereffects will be I mean Greyback being a werewolf but not transformed at the time .But the others .There were other bodies on the ground .Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt but Madam Pomfrey says theyll be all right .And a Death Eaters dead he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere Harry if we hadnt had your Felix potion I think wed all have been killed but everything seemed to just miss us They had reached the hospital wing .Pushing open the doors Harry saw Neville lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door .Ron Hermione Luna Tonks and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward .At the sound of the doors opening they all looked up .Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him Lupin moved forward too looking anxious .Are you all right Harry ?Im fine .Hows Bill ?Nobody answered .Harry looked over Hermiones shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bills pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque .Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harshsmelling green ointment .Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoys Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand .Cant you fix them with a charm or something ?he asked the matron .No charm will work on these said Madam Pomfrey .Ive tried everything I know but there is no cure for werewolf bites .But he wasnt bitten at the full moon said Ron who was gazing down into his brothers face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring .Greyback hadnt transformed so surely Bill wont be a a real ?He looked uncertainly at Lupin .No I dont think that Bill will be a true werewolf said Lupin but that does not mean that there wont be some contamination .Those are cursed wounds .They are unlikely ever to heal fully and and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on .Dumbledore might know something thatd work though Ron said .Where is he ?Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledores orders Dumbledore owes him he cant leave him in this state Ron Dumbledores dead said Ginny .No !Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry as though hoping the latter might contradict her but when Harry did not Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bills bed his hands over his face .Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before he felt as though he was intruding upon something private indecent .He turned away and caught Rons eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said .How did he die ?whispered Tonks .How did it happen ?Snape killed him said Harry .I was there I saw it .We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because thats where the Mark was .Dumbledore was ill he was weak but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs .He immobilized me I couldnt do anything I was under the Invisibility Cloak and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned .Lunas mouth trembled .more Death Eaters arrived and then Snape and Snape did it .The Avada Kedavra .Harry couldnt go on .Madam Pomfrey burst into tears .Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny who whispered Shh !Listen !Gulping Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth her eyes wide .Somewhere out in the darkness a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before a stricken lament of terrible beauty .And Harry felt as he had felt about phoenix song before that the music was inside him not without It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows .How long they all stood there listening he did not know nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward .Like all the rest she bore marks of the recent battle There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped .Molly and Arthur are on their way she said and the spell of the music was broken Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances turning again to look at Bill or else to rub their own eyes shake their heads .Harry what happened ?According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he when it happened .He says Professor Snape was involved in some Snape killed Dumbledore said Harry .She stared at him for a moment then swayed alarmingly Madam Pomfrey who seemed to have pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under McGonagall .Snape repeated McGonagall faintly falling into the chair .We all wondered .but he trusted .always .Snape .I cant believe it .Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens said Lupin his voice uncharacteristically harsh .We always knew that .But Dumbledore swore he was on our side !whispered Tonks .I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didnt .He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape muttered Professor McGonagall now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan edged handkerchief .I mean .with Snape s history .of course people were bound to wonder .but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape s repentance was absolutely genuine .Wouldnt hear a word against him !Id love to know what Snape told him to convince him said Tonks .I know said Harry and they all turned to look at him .Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad .Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadnt realized what he was doing he was really sorry hed done it sorry that they were dead .They all stared at him .And Dumbledore believed that ?said Lupin incredulously .Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead ?Snape hated James .And he didnt think my mother was worth a damn either said Harry because she was Muggleborn . ‘Mudblood he called her .Nobody asked how Harry knew this .All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened .This is all my fault said Professor McGonagall suddenly .She looked disoriented twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands .My fault .I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight I actually sent for him to come and help us !If I hadnt alerted Snape to what was going on he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters .I dont think he knew they were there before Filius told him I dont think he knew they were coming .It isnt your fault Minerva said Lupin firmly .We all wanted more help we were glad to think Snape was on his way .So when he arrived at the fight he joined in on the Death Eaters side ?asked Harry who wanted every detail of Snape s duplicity and infamy feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him to swear vengeance .I dont know exactly how it happened said Professor McGonagall distractedly .Its all so confusing .Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case .Remus Bill and Nymphadora were to join us .and so we patrolled .All seemed quiet .Every secret passageway out of the school was covered .We knew nobody could fly in .There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle .I still dont know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered .I do said Harry and he explained briefly about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed .So they got in through the Room of Requirement .Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione both of whom looked devastated .I messed up Harry said Ron bleakly .We did like you told us We checked the Marauders Map and we couldnt see Malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement so me Ginny and Neville went to keep watch on it .but Malfoy got past us .He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch said Ginny .He was on his own clutching that awful shriveled arm His Hand of Glory said Ron .Gives light only to the holder remember ?Anyway Ginny went on he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitchblack Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder said Ron bitterly .Fred and Georges .Im going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products .We tried everything Lumos Incendio said Ginny .Nothing would penetrate the darkness all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us .Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them but we didnt dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other and by the time wed reached a corridor that was light theyd gone .Luckily said Lupin hoarsely Ron Ginny and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened .We found the Death Eaters minutes later heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower .Malfoy obviously hadnt expected more people to be on the watch he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder at any rate .A fight broke out they scattered and we gave chase .One of them Gibbon broke away and headed up the tower stairs To set off the Mark ?asked Harry .He must have done yes they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement said Lupin .But I dont think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me .So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville said Harry turning to Hermione were you ?Outside Snapes office yes whispered Hermione her eyes sparkling with tears with Luna .We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened .We didnt know what was going on upstairs Ron had taken the map .It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons .He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle I dont think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all he just burst his way into Snapes office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and and What ?Harry urged her .I was so stupid Harry !said Hermione in a high pitched whisper .He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he while he went to help fight the Death Eaters She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers so that her voice was muffled .We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor .and oh its so obvious now Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick but we didnt realize Harry we didnt realize we just let Snape go !Its not your fault said Lupin firmly .Hermione had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way he probably would have killed you and Luna .So then he came upstairs said Harry who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his minds eye his black robes billowing behind him as ever pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended and he found the place where you were all fighting .We were in trouble we were losing said Tonks in a low voice .Gibbon was down but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death .Neville had been hurt Bill had been savaged by Greyback .It was all dark .curses flying everywhere .The Malfoy boy had vanished he must have slipped past up the stairs .then more of them ran after him but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse .Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air None of us could break through said Ron and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us .And then Snape was there said Tonks and then he wasnt I saw him running toward us but that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things said Ginny .I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasnt there said Lupin .I tried to follow him but was thrown back just like Neville .He must have known a spell we didnt whispered McGonagall .After all he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher .I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters whod escaped up to the tower .He was said Harry savagely but to help them not to stop them .and Ill bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier so what happened when he came back down ?Well the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in and also broke the curse blocking the stairs said Lupin .We all ran forward those of us who were still standing anyway and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust obviously none of us attacked them We just let them pass said Tonks in a hollow voice .We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters and next thing the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again I thought I heard Snape shout something but I dont know what He shouted ‘Its over said Harry .Hed done what hed meant to do .They all fell silent .Fawkess lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside .As the music reverberated upon the air unbidden unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harrys mind .Had they taken Dumbledores body from the foot of the tower yet ?What would happen to it next ?Where would it rest ?He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets .He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand .The doors of the hospital wing burst open making them all jump Mr and Mrs Weasley were striding up the ward Fleur just behind them her beautiful face terrified .Molly Arthur said Professor McGonagall jumping up and hurrying to greet them .I am so sorry Bill whispered Mrs Weasley darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bills mangled face .Oh Bill .Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr and Mrs Weasley could get nearer to the bed .Mrs Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead .You said Greyback attacked him ?Mr Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly .But he hadnt transformed ?So what does that mean ?What will happen to Bill ?We dont yet know said Professor McGonagall looking helplessly at Lupin .There will probably be some contamination Arthur said Lupin .It is an odd case possibly unique .We dont know what his behavior might be like when he awakens .Mrs Weasley took the nastysmelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bills wounds .And Dumbledore .said Mr Weasley .Minerva is it true .Is he really . ?As Professor McGonagall nodded Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her .Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face .Dumbledore gone whispered Mr Weasley but Mrs Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son she began to sob tears falling onto Bills mutilated face .Of course it doesnt matter how he looks .Its not rreally important .but he was a very handsome little bboy .always very handsome .and he was g going to be married !And what do you mean by zat ?said Fleur suddenly and loudly .What do you mean ‘e was going to be married ?Mrs Weasley raised her tearstained face looking startled .Well only that You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore ?demanded Fleur .You theenk because of these bites he will not love me ?No thats not what I Because e will !said Fleur drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair .It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me !Well yes Im sure said Mrs Weasley but I thought perhaps given how how he You thought I would not weesh to marry him ?Or peraps you hoped ?said Fleur her nostrils flaring .What do I care how he looks ?I am goodlooking enough for both of us I theenk !All these scars show is zat my husband is brave !And I shall do zat !she added fiercely pushing Mrs Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her .Mrs Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bills wounds with a most curious expression upon her face .Nobody said anything Harry did not dare move .Like everybody else he was waiting for the explosion .Our GreatAuntie Muriel said Mrs Weasley after a long pause has a very beautiful tiara goblinmade which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding .She is very fond of Bill you know and it would look lovely with your hair .Thank you said Fleur stiffly .I am sure zat will be lovely .And then Harry did not quite see how it happened both women were crying and hugging each other .Completely bewildered wondering whether the world had gone mad he turned around Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks .You see !said a strained voice .Tonks was glaring at Lupin .She still wants to marry him even though hes been bitten !She doesnt care !Its different said Lupin barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense .Bill will not be a full werewolf .The cases are completely But I dont care either I dont care !said Tonks seizing the front of Lupins robes and shaking them .Ive told you a million times .And the meaning of Tonkss Patronus and her mouse colored hair and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback all suddenly became clear to Harry it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all .And Ive told you a million times said Lupin refusing to meet her eyes staring at the floor that I am too old for you too poor .too dangerous .Ive said all along youre taking a ridiculous line on this Remus said Mrs Weasley over Fleurs shoulder as she patted her on the back .I am not being ridiculous said Lupin steadily .Tonks deserves somebody young and whole .But she wants you said Mr Weasley with a small smile .And after all Remus young and whole men do not necessarily remain so .He gestured sadly at his son lying between them .This is .not the moment to discuss it said Lupin avoiding everybodys eyes as he looked around distractedly .Dumbledore is dead .Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world said Professor McGonagall curtly just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in .The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen he was shaking with tears a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand .Ive .Ive done it Professor he choked .Mmoved him .Professor Sprouts got the kids back in bed .Professor Flitwicks lyin down but he says hell be all righ in a jiffy an Professor Slughorn says the Ministrys bin informed .Thank you Hagrid said Professor McGonagall standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Bills bed .I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here .Hagrid please tell the Heads of Houses Slughorn can represent Slytherin that I want to see them in my office forthwith .I would like you to join us too .As Hagrid nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at Harry .Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you Harry .If youll come with me .Harry stood up murmured See you in a bit to Ron Hermione and Ginny and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward .The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song .It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagalls office but for Dumbledores and another few seconds before he realized that of course she had been deputy headmistress .Apparently she was now headmistress .so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers .In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office .He did not know what he had expected that the room would be draped in black perhaps or even that Dumbledores body might be lying there .In fact it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindlelegged tables Gryffindors sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk .But Fawkess perch stood empty he was still crying his lament to the grounds .And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk his half moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled .After glancing once at this portrait Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself then rounded the desk to look at Harry her face taut and lined .Harry she said I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school .I cant tell you that Professor said Harry .He had expected the question and had his answer ready .It had been here in this very room that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione .Harry it might be important said Professor McGonagall .It is said Harry very but he didnt want me to tell anyone .Professor McGonagall glared at him .Potter Harry registered the renewed use of his surname in the light of Professor Dumbledores death I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat I dont think so said Harry shrugging .Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died .But Theres one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here though .Madam Rosmertas under the Imperius Curse she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters thats how the necklace and the poisoned mead Rosmerta ?said Professor McGonagall incredulously but before she could go on there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout Flitwick and Slughorn traipsed into the room followed by Hagrid who was still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief .Snape !ejaculated Slughorn who looked the most shaken pale and sweating .Snape !I taught him !I thought I knew him !But before any of them could respond to this a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall A sallowfaced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas .Minerva the Minister will be here within seconds he has just Disapparated from the Ministry .Thank you Everard said Professor McGonagall and she turned quickly to her teachers .I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here she said quickly .Personally I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year .The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts s history .It is horrible .I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open said Professor Sprout .I feel that if a single pupil wants to come then the school ought to remain open for that pupil .But will we have a single pupil after this ?said Slughorn now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief .Parents will want to keep their children at home and I cant say I blame them .Personally I dont think were in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you cant expect mothers to think like that .Theyll want to keep their families together its only natural .I agree said Professor McGonagall .And in any case it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close .When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school and I must say that Professor Dumbledores murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherins monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle .We must consult the governors said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snapes office .We must follow the established procedures .A decision should not be made hastily .Hagrid you havent said anything said Professor McGonagall .What are your views ought Hogwarts to remain open ?Hagrid who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation now raised puffy red eyes and croaked I dunno Professor .thats fer the Heads of House an the headmistress ter decide .Professor Dumbledore always valued your views said Professor McGonagall kindly and so do I .Well Im stayin said Hagrid fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard .Its me home its bin me home since I was thirteen .An if theres kids who wan me ter teach em Ill do it .But .I dunno .Hogwarts without Dumbledore .He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more and there was silence .Very well said Professor McGonagall glancing out of the window at the grounds checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors who will make the final decision .Now as to getting students home .there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later .We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary What about Dumbledores funeral ?said Harry speaking at last .Well .said Professor McGonagall losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook .I I know that it was Dumbledores wish to be laid to rest here at Hogwarts Then thats whatll happen isnt it ?said Harry fiercely .If the Ministry thinks it appropriate said Professor McGonagall .No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school growled Hagrid .Hogwarts should be Dumbledores final resting place said Professor Flitwick .Absolutely said Professor Sprout .And in that case said Harry you shouldnt send the students home until the funerals over .Theyll want to say The last word caught in his throat but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him .Goodbye .Well said squeaked Professor Flitwick .Well said indeed !Our students should pay tribute it is fitting .We can arrange transport home afterward .Seconded barked Professor Sprout .I suppose .yes .said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent .Hes coming said Professor McGonagall suddenly gazing down into the grounds .The Minister .and by the looks of it hes brought a delegation .Can I leave Professor ?said Harry at once .He had no desire at all to see or be interrogated by Rufus Scrimgeour tonight .You may said Professor McGonagall .And quickly .She strode toward the door and held it open for him .He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower but it did not matter there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass not even Filch Mrs Norris or Peeves .He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room .Is it true ?whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her .It is really true ?Dumbledore dead ?Yes said Harry .She let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him .As Harry had suspected it would be the common room was jampacked .The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole .He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby This meant that the dormitory must be empty or nearly so .Without speaking to anybody without making eye contact at all Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys dormitories .As he had hoped Ron was waiting for him still fully dressed sitting on his bed .Harry sat down on his own fourposter and for a moment they simply stared at each other .Theyre talking about closing the school said Harry .Lupin said they would said Ron .There was a pause .So ?said Ron in a very low voice as though he thought the furniture might be listening in .Did you find one ?Did you get it ?A a Horcrux ?Harry shook his head .All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now had it really happened and only hours ago ?You didnt get it ?said Ron looking crestfallen .It wasnt there ?No said Harry .Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place .Already taken ?Wordlessly Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket opened it and passed it to Ron .The full story could wait .It did not matter tonight .nothing mattered except the end the end of their pointless adventure the end of Dumbledores life .R .A .B .whispered Ron but who was that ?Dunno said Harry lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards .He felt no curiosity at all about R .A .B .He doubted that he would ever feel curious again .As he lay there he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent .Fawkes had stopped singing .And he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left Hogwarts for good just as Dumbledore had left the school had left the world .had left Harry .THE WHITE TOMB All lessons were suspended all examinations postponed .Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledores death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughtylooking father .Seamus Finnigan on the other hand refused pointblank to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral .She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade Seamus told Harry and Ron for wizards and witches were pouring into the village preparing to pay their last respects to Dumbledore .Some excitement was caused among the younger students who had never seen it before when a powderblue carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest .Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome oliveskinned blackhaired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrids arms .Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials including the Minister of Magic himself was being accommodated within the castle .Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them he was sure that sooner or later he would be asked again to account for Dumbledores last excursion from Hogwarts .Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together .The beautiful weather seemed to mock them Harry could imagine how it would have been if Dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year Ginnys examinations finished the pressure of homework lifted .and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew was right to do because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort .They visited the hospital wing twice a day Neville had been discharged but Bill remained under Madam Pomfreys care .His scars were as bad as ever in truth he now bore a distinct resemblance to MadEye Moody though thankfully with both eyes and legs but in personality he seemed just the same as ever .All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks . .so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said Fleur happily plumping up Bills pillows because ze British overcook their meat I ave always said this .I suppose Im just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her sighed Ginny later that evening as she Harry Ron and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit grounds .Shes not that bad said Harry .Ugly though he added hastily as Ginny raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle .Well I suppose if Mum can stand it I can .Anyone else we know died ?Ron asked Hermione who was perusing the Evening Prophet .Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice .No she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper .Theyre still looking for Snape but no sign .Of course there isnt said Harry who became angry every time this subject cropped up .They wont find Snape till they find Voldemort and seeing as theyve never managed to do that in all this time .Im going to go to bed yawned Ginny .I havent been sleeping that well since .well .I could do with some sleep .She kissed Harry Ron looked away pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the girls dormitories .The moment the door had closed behind her Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a most Hermioneish look on her face .Harry I found something out this morning in the library .R .A .B .said Harry sitting up straight .He did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone .There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed .He kept reciting their names to himself as though by listing them he could bring them within reach the locket .the cup .the snake .something of Gryffindors or Ravenclaws .the locket .the cup .the snake .something of Gryffindors or Ravenclaws .This mantra seemed to pulse through Harrys mind as he fell asleep at night and his dreams were thick with cups lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb .He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore s death and although she had not immediately recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do .No she said sadly Ive been trying Harry but I havent found anything .There are a couple of reasonably wellknown wizards with those initials Rosalind Antigone Bungs .Rupert ‘Axebanger Brookstanton .but they dont seem to fit at all .Judging by that note the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort and I cant find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him .No actually its about .well Snape .She looked nervous even saying the name again .What about him ?asked Harry heavily slumping back in his chair .Well its just that I was sort of right about the Half Blood Prince business she said tentatively .Dyou have to rub it in Hermione ?How dyou think I feel about that now ?No no Harry I didnt mean that !she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard .Its just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book .You see .she was Snape s mother !I thought she wasnt much of a looker said Ron .Hermione ignored him .I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape and then later an announcement saying that shed given birth to a murderer spat Harry .Well .yes said Hermione .So .I was sort of right .Snape must have been proud of being ‘half a Prince you see ?Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet Yeah that fits said Harry .Hed play up the pure blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them .Hes just like Voldemort .Pure blood mother Muggle father .ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts gave himself an impressive new name Lord Voldemort the HalfBlood Prince how could Dumbledore have missed ?He broke off looking out the window .He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore s inexcusable trust in Snape .but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he Harry had been taken in just the same .In spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much .Helped him .it was an almost unendurable thought now .I still dont get why he didnt turn you in for using that book said Ron .He mustve known where you were getting it all from .He knew said Harry bitterly .He knew when I used Sectumsempra .He didnt really need Legilimency .He might even have known before then with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions . .Shouldnt have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he ?But why didnt he turn you in ?I dont think he wanted to associate himself with that book said Hermione .I dont think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if hed known .And even if Snape pretended it hadnt been his Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once .Anyway the book was left in Snapes old classroom and Ill bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince .I shouldve shown the book to Dumbledore said Harry .All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school and I had proof Snape was too ‘Evil is a strong word said Hermione quietly .You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous !Im trying to say Harry that youre putting too much blame on yourself .I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer .None of us couldve guessed Snape would .you know said Ron .Silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thoughts but Harry was sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when Dumbledores body would be laid to rest .He had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died .He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel .He wondered whether Dumbledores death would be more real to him once it was over .Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone .Admittedly he had not as he had with Sirius looked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that Dumbledore would come back .He felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not as a talisman but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do .Harry rose early to pack the next day the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral .Downstairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued .Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry .Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty .Hagrids chair was deserted too Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but Snapes place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour .Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him .Among Scrimgeours entourage Harry spotted the red hair and hornrimmed glasses of Percy Weasley .Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom .Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together .Hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of Malfoy between them bossing them around .Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought .His animosity was all for Snape but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoys voice on that tower top nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived .Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore .He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike .Where Harry wondered was Malfoy now and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents ?Harrys thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny .Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once .It is nearly time she said .Please follow your Heads of Houses out into the grounds .Gryffindors after me .They filed out from behind their benches in near silence .Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column wearing magnificent long emerald green robes embroidered with silver .He had never seen Professor Sprout Head of the Hufflepuffs looking so clean there was not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs .They were heading as Harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors toward the lake .The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows .An aisle ran down the center of them There was a marble table standing at the front all chairs facing it .It was the most beautiful summers day .An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs shabby and smart old and young .Most Harry did not recognize but a few he did including members of the Order of the Phoenix Kingsley Shacklebolt MadEye Moody Tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink Remus Lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hands Mr and Mrs Weasley Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin .Then there was Madame Maxime who took up two and a half chairs on her own Tom the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London Arabella Figg Harrys Squib neighbor the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters Ernie Prang driver of the Knight Bus Madam Malkin of the robe shop in Diagon Alley and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight such as the barman of the Hogs Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express .The castle ghosts were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air .Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake .People were whispering to each other it sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong was louder by far .The crowd continued to swell with a great rush of affection for both of them Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna .Neville and Luna alone of the D .A .had responded to Hermione s summons the night that Dumbledore had died and Harry knew why They were the ones who had missed the D .A .most .probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting .Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat as usual Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter who he was infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her redtaloned hand and then with a worse jolt of fury Dolores Umbridge an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velvet bow set atop her ironcolored curls .At the sight of the centaur Firenze who was standing like a sentinel near the waters edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away .The staff was seated at last .Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall .He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore was dead .But then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it .He was not the only one Many heads were turning searching a little alarmed .In there whispered Ginny in Harrys ear .And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water inches below the surface reminding him horribly of the Inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand their pallid faces rippling their purplish hair flowing all around them .The music made the hair on Harrys neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant .It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair .As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for Dumbledores passing .Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked around .Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs .He was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his arms wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars was what Harry knew to be Dumbledores body .A sharp pain rose in Harrys throat at this sight For a moment the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledores body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day .Ron looked white and shocked .Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny s and Hermiones laps .They could not see clearly what was happening at the front .Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table .Now he retreated down the aisle blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalized looks from some including Harry saw Dolores Umbridge .but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared .He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed but Hagrids eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going .Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee was the giant Grawp his great ugly boulderlike head bowed docile almost human .Hagrid sat down next to his halfbrother and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head so that his chair legs sank into the ground .Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh .But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again .A little tuftyhaired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore s body .Harry could not hear what he was saying .Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of heads .Nobility of spirit .intellectual contribution .greatness of heart .It did not mean very much .It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him .He suddenly remembered Dumbledore s idea of a few words nitwit oddment blubber and tweak and again had to suppress a grin .What was the matter with him ?There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too .He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the waters edge two years ago very close to where Harry now sat and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess .Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish .There was so much he had never asked him so much he should have said .And then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now .Dumbledore was dead gone .He clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes He looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake toward the forest as the little man in black droned on .There was movement among the trees .The centaurs had come to pay their respects too .They did not move into the open but Harry saw them standing quite still half hidden in shadow watching the wizards their bows hanging at their sides .And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter .It was important Dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated .And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally Dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that was over .He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a parents arms meant that nothing could hurt him .There was no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before .The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat .Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the Minister but nobody moved .Then several people screamed .Bright white flames had erupted around Dumbledores body and the table upon which it lay Higher and higher they rose obscuring the body .White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes Harry thought for one heart stopping moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished .In its place was a white marble tomb encasing Dumbledores body and the table on which he had rested .There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd .It was Harry knew the centaurs tribute He saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees .Likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view .Harry looked at Ginny Ron and Hermione Rons face was screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him .Hermione s face was glazed with tears but Ginny was no longer crying .She met Harrys gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he was going to do now she would not say Be careful or Dont do it but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him .And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died .Ginny listen .he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet I cant be involved with you anymore .Weve got to stop seeing each other .We cant be together .She said with an oddly twisted smile Its for some stupid noble reason isnt it ?Its been like .like something out of someone elses life these last few weeks with you said Harry .But I cant .we cant .Ive got things to do alone now .She did not cry she simply looked at him .Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to .Hes already used you as bait once and that was just because youre my best friends sister .Think how much danger youll be in if we keep this up .Hell know hell find out .Hell try and get to me through you .What if I dont care ?said Ginny fiercely .I care said Harry .How do you think Id feel if this was your funeral .and it was my fault .She looked away from him over the lake .I never really gave up on you she said .Not really .I always hoped .Hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember ?And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more myself .Smart girl that Hermione said Harry trying to smile .I just wish Id asked you sooner .We couldve had ages .months .years maybe .But youve been too busy saving the Wizarding world said Ginny half laughing .Well .I cant say Im surprised .I knew this would happen in the end .I knew you wouldnt be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort .Maybe thats why I like you so much .Harry could not bear to hear these things nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her .Ron he saw was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dripping from the end of his own long nose .With a miserable gesture Harry got up turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledores tomb and walked away around the lake .Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it .Harry !He turned .Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the bank leaning on his walking stick .Ive been hoping to have a word .do you mind if I walk a little way with you ?No said Harry indifferently and set off again .Harry this was a dreadful tragedy said Scrimgeour quietly .I cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it .Dumbledore was a very great wizard .We had our disagreements as you know but no one knows better than I What do you want ?asked Harry flatly .Scrimgeour looked annoyed but as before hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding .You are of course devastated he said .I know that you were very close to Dumbledore .I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever .The bond between the two of you What do you want ?Harry repeated coming to a halt .Scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at Harry his expression shrewd now .The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died .Whose word ?said Harry .Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after Dumbledore died .There were also two broomsticks up there .The Ministry can add two and two Harry .Glad to hear it said Harry .Well where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business .He didnt want people to know .Such loyalty is admirable of course said Scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty but Dumbledore is gone Harry .Hes gone .He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him said Harry smiling in spite of himself .My dear boy .even Dumbledore cannot return from the I am not saying he can .You wouldnt understand .But Ive got nothing to tell you .Scrimgeour hesitated then said in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection you know Harry .I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service Harry laughed .Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors wont stop him .So thanks for the offer but no thanks .So said Scrimgeour his voice cold now the request I made of you at Christmas What request ?Oh yeah .the one where I tell the world what a great job youre doing in exchange for for raising everyones morale !snapped Scrimgeour .Harry considered him for a moment .Released Stan Shunpike yet ?Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon .I see you are Dumbledores man through and through said Harry .Thats right .Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word .Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp who were still in their seats .Ron and Hermione were hurrying toward Harry passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction .Harry turned and walked slowly on waiting for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times .What did Scrimgeour want ?Hermione whispered .Same as he wanted at Christmas shrugged Harry .Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministrys new poster boy .Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to Hermione Look let me go back and hit Percy !No she said firmly grabbing his arm .Itll make me feel better !Harry laughed .Even Hermione grinned a little though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle .I cant bear the idea that we might never come back she said softly .How can Hogwarts close ?Maybe it wont said Ron .Were not in any more danger here than we are at home are we ?Everywheres the same now .Id even say Hogwarts is safer there are more wizards inside to defend the place .What dyou reckon Harry ?Im not coming back even if it does reopen said Harry .Ron gaped at him but Hermione said sadly I knew you were going to say that .But then what will you do ? ‘Tm going back to the Dursleys once more because Dumbledore wanted me to said Harry .But itll be a short visit and then Ill be gone for good .But where will you go if you dont come back to school ?I thought I might go back to Godrics Hollow Harry muttered .He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledores death .For me it started there all of it .Ive just got a feeling I need to go there .And I can visit my parents graves Id like that .And then what ?said Ron .Then Ive got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes havent I ?said Harry his eyes upon Dumbledores white tomb reflected in the water on the other side of the lake .Thats what he wanted me to do thats why he told me all about them .If Dumbledore was right and Im sure he was there are still four of them out there .Ive got to find them and destroy them and then Ive got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemorts soul the bit thats still in his body and Im the one whos going to kill him .And if I meet Severus Snape along the way he added so much the better for me so much the worse for him .There was a long silence .The crowd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water .Well be there Harry said Ron .What ?At your aunt and uncles house said Ron .And then well go with you wherever youre going .No said Harry quickly he had not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone .You said to us once before said Hermione quietly that there was time to turn back if we wanted to .Weve had time havent we ?Were with you whatever happens said Ron .But mate youre going to have to come round my mum and dads house before we do anything else even Godrics Hollow .Why ?Bill and Fleurs wedding remember ?Harry looked at him startled the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful .Yeah we shouldnt miss that he said finally .His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come whether in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione .I THE DARK LORD ASCENDING The two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane .For a second they stood quite still wands directed at each others chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction .News ?asked the taller of the two .The best replied Severus Snape .The lane was bordered on the left by wild low growing brambles on the right by a high neatly manicured hedge .The mens long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched .Thought I might be late said Yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight .It was a little trickier than I expected .But I hope he will be satisfied .You sound confident that your reception will be good ?Snape nodded but did not elaborate .They turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane .The high hedge curved with them running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wroughtiron gates barring the mens way .Neither of them broke step In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal were smoke .The yew hedges muffled the sound of the mens footsteps .There was a rustle somewhere to their right Yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companions head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a purewhite peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge .He always did himself well Lucius .Peacocks .Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort .A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamondpaned downstairs windows .Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing .Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it .The hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor .The eyes of the palefaced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past .The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then Snape turned the bronze handle .The drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table .The rooms usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls .Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror .Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold .As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope and reflected in the mirror and in the bare polished surface of the table below .None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it .He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so .Yaxley .Snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table .You are very nearly late .The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette .As they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical .He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow .Severus here said Voldemort indicating the seat on his immediate right .Yaxley beside Dolohov .The two men took their allotted places .Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first .So ?My Lord the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next at nightfall .The interest around the table sharpened palpably Some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at Snape and Voldemort .Saturday .at nightfall repeated Voldemort .His red eyes fastened upon Snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze .Snape however looked calmly back into Voldemorts face and after a moment or two Voldemorts lipless mouth curved into something like a smile .Good .Very good .And this information comes from the source we discussed said Snape .My Lord .Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape .All faces turned to him .My Lord I have heard differently .Yaxley waited but Voldemort did not speak so he went on Dawlish the Auror let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen .Snape was smiling .My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it .No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish .It would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible .I assure you my Lord Dawlish seemed quite certain said Yaxley .If he has been Confunded naturally he is certain said Snape .I assure you Yaxley the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter .The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry .The Orders got one thing right then eh ?said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table .Voldemort did not laugh .His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought .My Lord Yaxley went on Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy Voldemort held up a large white hand and Yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape .Where are they going to hide the boy next ?At the home of one of the Order said Snape .The place according to the source has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide .I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my Lord unless of course the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest .Well Yaxley ?Voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes .Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday ?Once again all heads turned .Yaxley squared his shoulders .My Lord I have good news on that score .I have with difficulty and after great effort suceeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse .Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed his neighbor Dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back .It is a start said Voldemort .But Thicknesse is only one man .Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act .One failed attempt on the Ministers life will set me back a long way .Yes my Lord that is true but you know as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments .It will I think be easy now that we have such a highranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down .As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said Voldemort .At any rate it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday .If we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels .We are at an advantage there my Lord said Yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval .We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport .If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network we shall know immediately .He will not do either said Snape .The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place .All the better said Voldemort .He will have to move in the open .Easier to take by far .Again Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on I shall attend to the boy in person .There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned .Some of them have been my own .That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs .The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potters continued existence .Voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him .I have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans .But I know better now .I understand those things that I did not understand before .I must be the one to kill Harry Potter and I shall be .At these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawnout cry of misery and pain .Many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet .Wormtail said Voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet ?Yes mmy Lord gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared at first glance to be unoccupied .Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver .As I was saying continued Voldemort looking again at the tense faces of his followers I understand better now .I shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter .The faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms .No volunteers ?said Voldemort .Lets see .Lucius I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore .Lucius Malfoy looked up .His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed .When he spoke his voice was hoarse .My Lord ?Your wand Lucius .I require your wand .Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife .She was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist .At her touch Malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to Voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely .What is it ?Elm my Lord whispered Malfoy .And the core ?Dragon dragon heartstring .Good said Voldemort .He drew out his own wand and compared the lengths .Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive Voldemorts wand in exchange for his own .The gesture was not missed by Voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously .Give you my wand Lucius ?My wand ?Some of the throng sniggered .I have given you your liberty Lucius is that not enough for you ?But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late .What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you Lucius ?Nothing nothing my Lord !Such lies Lucius .The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving .One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table .The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemorts chair .It rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across Voldemorts shoulders its neck the thickness of a mans thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking .Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers still looking at Lucius Malfoy .Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot ?Is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years ?Of course my Lord said Lucius Malfoy .His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip .We did desire it we do .To Malfoys left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake .To his right his son Draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact .My Lord said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our familys house .There can be no higher pleasure .She sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness .No higher pleasure repeated Voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix .That means a great deal Bellatrix from you .Her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight .My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth !No higher pleasure .even compared with the happy event that I hear has taken place in your family this week ?She stared at him her lips parted evidently confused .I dont know what you mean my Lord .Im talking about your niece Bellatrix .And yours Lucius and Narcissa .She has just married the werewolf Remus Lupin .You must be so proud .There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table .Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists .The great snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the Death Eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys humiliation .Bellatrixs face so recently flushed with happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red .She is no niece of ours my Lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth .We Narcissa and I have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood .This brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries .What say you Draco ?asked Voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers .Will you babysit the cubs ?The hilarity mounted Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mothers eye .She shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall .Enough said Voldemort stroking the angry snake .Enough .And the laughter died at once .Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time he said as Bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring .You must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy ?Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest .Yes my Lord whispered Bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again .At the first chance !You shall have it said Voldemort .And in your family so in the world .we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain .Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoys wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick .The figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds .Do you recognize our guest Severus ?asked Voldemort .Snape raised his eyes to the upsidedown face .All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now as though they had been given permission to show curiosity .As she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice Severus !Help me !Ah yes said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again .And you Draco ?asked Voldemort stroking the snakes snout with his wandfree hand .Draco shook his head jerkily .Now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore .But you would not have taken her classes said Voldemort .For those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .There were small noises of comprehension around the table .A broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled .Yes .Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles .how they are not so different from us .One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor .Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again .Severus .please .please .Silence said Voldemort with another twitch of Malfoys wand and Charity fell silent as if gagged .Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet Wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic .The dwindling of the purebloods is says Professor Burbage a most desirable circumstance .She would have us all mate with Muggles .or no doubt werewolves .Nobody laughed this time There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemorts voice .For the third time Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape .Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair .Snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again .Avada Kedavra .The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room .Charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked .Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs .Draco fell out of his onto the floor .Dinner Nagini said Voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood .IN MEMORIAM Harry was bleeding .Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door .There was a crunch of breaking china He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door .What the ?He looked around the landing of number four Privet Drive was deserted .Possibly the cup of tea was Dudleys idea of a clever booby trap .Keeping his bleeding hand elevated Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door .Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap .It was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic .but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him .He had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it particularly in light of his immediate plans this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education .Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him .Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago .At the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit .Minutes previously Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood .He now proceeded a little more cautiously .Kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between Support CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS a cracked and wornout Sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed R .A .B .had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage .He recognized it at once .It was a twoinchlong fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather Sirius had given him .Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfathers last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit .Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him .Then he placed the fragment on top of that mornings Daily Prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk .It took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on .His school and Quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind .He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime .His Muggle clothing Invisibility Cloak potionmaking kit certain books the photograph album Hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack .In a front pocket were the Marauders Map and the locket with the note signed R .A .B .inside it .The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable in all usual senses it was worthless but because of what it had cost to attain it .This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl Hedwig one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer .He got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk .Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one .The owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment .As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers Harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts .At last he found it .Turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for .ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED by Elphias Doge I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at Hogwarts .Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders .I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while I was no longer contagious my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me .For his part Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety .Scarcely a year previously his father Percival had been convicted of a savage and wellpublicized attack upon three young Muggles .Albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in Azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when I plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty .Beyond that Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so .Some indeed were disposed to praise his fathers action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle hater .They could not have been more mistaken As anybody who knew Albus would attest he never revealed the remotest antiMuggle tendency .Indeed his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years .In a matter of months however Albuss own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father .By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Mugglehater but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school .Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous .He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching .He not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including Nicolas Flamel the celebrated alchemist Bathilda Bagshot the noted historian and Adalbert Waffling the magical theoretician .Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today Challenges in Charming and The Practical Potioneer .Dumbledores future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic .Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had Ministerial ambitions .Three years after we had started at Hogwarts Albuss brother Aberforth arrived at school .They were not alike Aberforth was never bookish and unlike Albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion .However it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends .They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do .In fairness to Aberforth it must be admitted that living in Albuss shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience .Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother .When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then traditional tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers .However tragedy intervened .On the very eve of our trip Albuss mother Kendra died leaving Albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family .I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendras funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey .With a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me .That was the period of our lives when we had least contact .I wrote to Albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists .His letters told me little of his daytoday life which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard .Immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that I heard toward the end of my years travels that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores the death of his sister Ariana .Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers .All those closest to Albus and I count myself one of that lucky number agree that Ariana s death and Albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore .I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering .Albus was more reserved than before and much less light hearted .To add to his misery the loss of Ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth but to an estrangement .In time this would lift in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one .However he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them .Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years .Dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot .They say still that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1 945 .Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle .Dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the Wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He WhoMustNotBeNamed .Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy .I shall miss his friendship more than I can say but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding worlds .That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question .He died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him .Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary .Dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his halfmoon spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of Xraying Harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation .He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all .Never once had he imagined Dumbledore s childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him venerable and silverhaired and old .The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly BlastEnded Skrewt .He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past .No doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements .No they had always discussed Harry Harrys past Harrys future Harrys plans .and it seemed to Harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly What do you see when you look in the mirror ??I see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks .After several minutes thought Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts .Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room .It was much tidier .The only things left out of place were todays Daily Prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror .Harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off todays Prophet and unfolded the newspaper .He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolledup paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort .Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort .It was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed .Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried DUMBLEDORE THE TRUTH AT LAST ?Coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation .Stripping away the popular image of serene silverbearded wisdom Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the lifelong feuds and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave .WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster ?WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix ?HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end ?The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore by Rita Skeeter exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite In person Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quillportraits might suggest .Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip .Well of course Dumbledore is a biographers dream says Skeeter .Such a long full life .Im sure my book will be the first of very very many .Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark .Her nine hundredpage book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumbledore s mysterious death in June .I ask her how she managed this superfast feat .Oh when youve been a journalist as long as I have working to a deadline is second nature .I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need .I mention the recent widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledores that Skeeters book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card .Skeeter throws back her head and laughs .Darling Dodgy !I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him .Completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout .And yet Elphias Doges accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places .Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledores long and extraordinary life ?Oh my dear beams Skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons a refusal to hear the word ‘no and a nice sharp QuickQuotes Quill !People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway .Not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know he trod on an awful lot of important toes .But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff because Ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth .The advance publicity for Skeeter s biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life .What were the biggest surprises she uncovered I ask ?Now come off it Betty Im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book !laughs Skeeter .But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening !Lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against YouKnowWho would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth !And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly broadminded when he was younger !Yes Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up .I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore s brother Aberforth whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago .Oh Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs Skeeter .No no Im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the Mugglemaiming father Dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the Wizengamot .No its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness but as I say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details .All I can say now is its no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken .Family skeletons notwithstanding does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore s many magical discoveries ?He had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements .As I reveal in chapter sixteen Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when Dumbledore ‘borrowed his papers .But the importance of some of Dumbledores achievements cannot I venture be denied .What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald ?Oh now Im glad you mentioned Grindelwald says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile .Im afraid those who go dewyeyed over Dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell or perhaps a Dungbomb .Very dirty business indeed .All Ill say is dont be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend .After theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly !Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other .Oh yes says Skeeter nodding briskly I devote an entire chapter to the whole PotterDumbledore relationship .Its been called unhealthy even sinister .Again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go .Whether that was really in the boys best interests well well see .Its certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence .I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that YouKnowWho had returned .Oh yes weve developed a close bond says Skeeter .Poor Potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life the Triwizard Tournament .I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter .Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledores final hours .Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died ?Well I dont want to say too much its all in the book but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed .Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge .Is everything as it seems ?That is for the Wizarding community to decide once theyve read my book .On that intriguing note I take my leave .There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller .Dumbledores legions of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero .Harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page .Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin .He began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from Ritas article echoed in his head An entire chapter to the whole PotterDumbledore relationship .Its been called unhealthy even sinister .He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth .Ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for .Lies !Harry bellowed and through the window he saw the nextdoor neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously .Harry sat down hard on the bed .The broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him .A flash of brightest blue .Harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again .He had imagined it he must have done .He glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunias choosing There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect .He peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him .He had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster .If anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again .3 THE DURSLEYS DEPARTING The sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice yelled Oi !You !Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond .He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw Dumbledores eye .It was not until his uncle bellowed BOY !that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him .You took your time !roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs .Get down here I want a word !Harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his jeans pockets .When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys .They were dressed for traveling Uncle Vernon in a fawn zipup jacket Aunt Petunia in a neat salmoncolored coat and Dudley Harrys large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket .Yes ?asked Harry .Sit down !said Uncle Vernon .Harry raised his eyebrows .Please !added Uncle Vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat .Harry sat .He thought he knew what was coming .His uncle began to pace up and down Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with anxious expressions .Finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke .Ive changed my mind he said .What a surprise said Harry .Dont you take that tone began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice but Vernon Dursley waved her down .Its all a lot of claptrap said Uncle Vernon glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes .Ive decided I dont believe a word of it .Were staying put were not going anywhere .Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement .Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twentyfour hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart .Harrys favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing .According to you Vernon Dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room we Petunia Dudley and I are in danger .From from Some of ‘my lot right said Harry .Well I dont believe it repeated Uncle Vernon coming to a halt in front of Harry again .I was awake half the night thinking it all over and I believe its a plot to get the house .The house ?repeated Harry .What house ?This house !shrieked Uncle Vernon the vein in his forehead starting to pulse .Our house !House prices are skyrocketing around here !You want us out of the way and then youre going to do a bit of hocuspocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and Are you out of your mind ?demanded Harry .A plot to get this house ?Are you actually as stupid as you look ?Dont you dare !squealed Aunt Petunia but again Vernon waved her down Slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted .Just in case youve forgotten said Harry Ive already got a house my godfather left me one .So why would I want this one ?All the happy memories ?There was silence .Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument .You claim said Uncle Vernon starting to pace yet again that this Lord Thing Voldemort said Harry impatiently and weve been through this about a hundred times already .This isnt a claim its fact Dumbledore told you last year and Kingsley and Mr Weasley Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into Harrys summer holidays of two fully grown wizards .The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys .Harry had to admit however that as Mr Weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon .Kingsley and Mr Weasley explained it all as well Harry pressed on remorselessly .Once Im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me .The Order is sure Voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where I am or because he thinks by holding you hostage Id come and try to rescue you .Uncle Vernons and Harrys eyes met .Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing .Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed Youve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help .Youre being offered serious protection the best there is .Uncle Vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down .Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges .The nextdoor neighbors lawn mower stalled again .I thought there was a Ministry of Magic ?asked Vernon Dursley abruptly .There is said Harry surprised .Well then why cant they protect us ?It seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection !Harry laughed he could not help himself .It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted .You heard what Mr Weasley and Kingsley said Harry replied .We think the Ministry has been infiltrated .Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back breathing so heavily that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration .All right he said stopping in front of Harry yet again .All right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection .I still dont see why we cant have that Kingsley bloke .Harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty .This question had also been addressed half a dozen times .As Ive told you he said through gritted teeth Kingsley is protecting the Mug I mean your Prime Minister .Exactly hes the best !said Uncle Vernon pointing at the blank television screen .The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital .This and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in .Well hes taken said Harry .But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the job If wed even seen CVs .began Uncle Vernon but Harry lost patience .Getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle now pointing at the TV set himself .These accidents arent accidents the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news .People are disappearing and dying and hes behind it Voldemort .Ive told you this over and over again he kills Muggles for fun .Even the fogs theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son !Dudleys hands jerked upward to cover his mouth .With his parents and Harrys eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked There are .more of them ?More ?laughed Harry .More than the two that attacked us you mean ?Of course there are there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair All right all right blustered Vernon Dursley .Youve made your point I hope so said Harry because once Im seventeen all of them Death Eaters dementors maybe even Inferi which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard will be able to find you and will certainly attack you .And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards I think you 11 agree you need help .There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years .Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon Dudley was staring at Harry .Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out But what about my work ?What about Dudleys school ?I dont suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards Dont you understand ?shouted Harry .They will torture and kill you like they did my parents !Dad said Dudley in a loud voice Dad Im going with these Order people .Dudley said Harry for the first time in your life youre talking sense .He knew that the battle was won .If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Orders help his parents would accompany him There could be no question of being separated from their Diddykins .Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece .Theyll be here in about five minutes he said and when none of the Dursleys replied he left the room .The prospect of parting probably forever from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air .What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years solid dislike ?Back in his bedroom Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwigs cage .They fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them .Were leaving soon really soon Harry told her .And then youll be able to fly again .The doorbell rang .Harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs .It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own .Harry Potter !squeaked an excited voice the moment Harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow .An honor as ever !Thanks Dedalus said Harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the darkhaired Hestia .Its really good of you to do this .Theyre through here my aunt and uncle and cousin .Good day to you Harry Potters relatives !said Dedalus happily striding into the living room .The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus Harry half expected another change of mind .Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard .I see you are packed and ready .Excellent !The plan as Harry has told you is a simple one said Dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it .We shall be leaving before Harry does .Due to the danger of using magic in your house Harry being still underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him we shall be driving say ten miles or so before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you .You know how to drive I take it ?he asked Uncle Vernon politely .Know how to ?Of course I ruddy well know how to drive !spluttered Uncle Vernon .Very clever of you sir very clever I personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs said Dedalus .He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke .Cant even drive he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him .You Harry Dedalus continued will wait here for your guard .There has been a little change in the arrangements What dyou mean ?said Harry at once .I thought MadEye was going to come and take me by Side Along Apparition ?Cant do it said Hestia tersely .MadEye will explain .The Dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched Hurry up Harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from Dedaluss pocket watch .Quite right were operating to a very tight schedule said Dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat .We are attempting to time your departure from the house with your familys Disapparition Harry thus the charm breaks at the moment you all head for safety .He turned to the Dursleys .Well are we all packed and ready to go ?None of them answered him .Uncle Vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in Dedaluss waistcoat pocket .Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall Dedalus murmured Hestia .She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells .Theres no need Harry muttered but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly Well this is goodbye then boy .He swung his right arm upward to shake Harrys hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome .Ready Diddy ?asked Aunt Petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether .Dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding Harry a little of the giant Grawp .Come along then said Uncle Vernon .He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled I dont understand .What dont you understand popkin ?asked Aunt Petunia looking up at her son .Dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at Harry .Why isnt he coming with us ?Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood staring at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina .What ?said Uncle Vernon loudly .Why isnt he coming too ?asked Dudley .Well he he doesnt want to said Uncle Vernon turning to glare at Harry and adding You dont want to do you ?Not in the slightest said Harry .There you are Uncle Vernon told Dudley .Now come on were off .He marched out of the room .They heard the front door open but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too .What now ?barked Uncle Vernon reappearing in the doorway .It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words .After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said But wheres he going to go ?Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other .It was clear that Dudley was frightening them .Hestia Jones broke the silence .But .surely you know where your nephew is going ?she asked looking bewildered .Certainly we know said Vernon Dursley .Hes off with some of your lot isnt he ?Right Dudley lets get in the car you heard the man were in a hurry .Again Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door but Dudley did not follow .Off with some of our lot ?Hestia looked outraged .Harry had met this attitude before Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter .Its fine Harry assured her .It doesnt matter honestly .Doesnt matter ?repeated Hestia her voice rising ominously .Dont these people realize what youve been through ?What danger you are in ?The unique position you hold in the hearts of the antiVoldemort movement ?Er no they dont said Harry .They think Im a waste of space actually but Im used to I dont think youre a waste of space .If Harry had not seen Dudleys lips move he might not have believed it .As it was he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing Dudley had turned red .Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself .Well .er .thanks Dudley .Again Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling You saved my life .Not really said Harry .It was your soul the dementor would have taken .He looked curiously at his cousin .They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much .It now dawned on Harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all .Although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings .After opening his mouth once or twice more Dudley subsided into scarletfaced silence .Aunt Petunia burst into tears .Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry .Sso sweet Dudders .she sobbed into his massive chest .Ssuch a lovely bboy .ssaying thank you But he hasnt said thank you at all !said Hestia indignantly .He only said he didnt think Harry was a waste of space !Yeah but coming from Dudley thats like ‘I love you said Harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building .Are we going or not ?roared Uncle Vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door .I thought we were on a tight schedule !Yes yes we are said Dedalus Diggle who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together .We really must be off .Harry He tripped forward and wrung Harrys hand with both of his own .good luck .I hope we meet again .The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders .Oh said Harry right .Thanks .Farewell Harry said Hestia also clasping his hand .Our thoughts go with you .I hope everythings okay said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley .Oh Im sure we shall end up the best of chums said Diggle brightly waving his hat as he left the room .Hestia followed him .Dudley gently released himself from his mothers clutches and walked toward Harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic .Then Dudley held out his large pink hand .Blimey Dudley said Harry over Aunt Petunias renewed sobs did the dementors blow a different personality into you ?Dunno muttered Dudley .See you Harry .Yeah .said Harry taking Dudleys hand and shaking it .Maybe .Take care Big D .Dudley nearly smiled then lumbered from the room .Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed .Aunt Petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound .She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry .Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said Well goodbye and marched toward the door without looking at him .Goodbye said Harry .She stopped and looked back .For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him She gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little jerk of her head she bustled out of the room after her husband and son .THE SEVEN POTTERS Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road .Dedaluss top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat .The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone .Harry picked up Hedwigs cage his Firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs .The light was fading rapidly now the hall full of shadows in the evening light .It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time .Long ago when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudleys computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his hearts content .It gave him an odd empty feeling to remember those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost .Dont you want to take a last look at the place ?he asked Hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing .Well never be here again .Dont you want to remember all the good times ?I mean look at this doormat .What memories .Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors .Turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it ? .And last summer Dumbledore walked through that front door .Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing .Harry turned his back on the front door .And under here Hedwig Harry pulled open a door under the stairs is where I used to sleep !You never knew me then Blimey its small Id forgotten .Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two .Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him .But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it a flying motorbike .There was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby .Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame .Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernons choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden .The darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering .Then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted .Dominating the scene was Hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached .All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses .Wrenching open the back door Harry hurtled into their midst .There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him Ron clapped him on the back and Hagrid said All righ Harry ?Ready fer the off ?Definitely said Harry beaming around at them all .But I wasnt expecting this many of you !Change of plan growled MadEye who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity .Lets get undercover before we talk you through it .Harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon Aunt Petunias gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances Ron long and lanky Hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait Fred and George grinning identically Bill badly scarred and long haired Mr Weasley kindfaced balding his spectacles a little awry MadEye battleworn one legged his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket Tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink Lupin grayer more lined Fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair Kingsley bald black broadshouldered Hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and Mundungus Fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy basset hounds eyes and matted hair .Harrys heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight He felt incredibly fond of all of them even Mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met .Kingsley I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister ?he called across the room .He can get along without me for one night said Kingsley .Youre more important .Harry guess what ?said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glittered there .You got married ?Harry yelped looking from her to Lupin .Im sorry you couldnt be there Harry it was very quiet .Thats brilliant congrat All right all right well have time for a cozy catchup later !roared Moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen .Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry .As Dedalus probably told you we had to abandon Plan A .Pius Thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem .Hes made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network place a Portkey here or Apparate in or out .All done in the name of your protection to prevent YouKnowWho getting in at you .Absolutely pointless seeing as your mothers charm does that already .What hes really done is to stop you getting out of here safely .Second problem Youre underage which means youve still got the Trace on you .I dont The Trace the Trace !said MadEye impatiently .The charm that detects magical activity around underseventeens the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic !If you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here Thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the Death Eaters .We cant wait for the Trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen youll lose all the protection your mother gave you .In short Pius Thicknesse thinks hes got you cornered good and proper .Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse .So what are we going to do ?Were going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the Trace cant detect because we dont need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and Hagrids motorbike .Harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give MadEye the chance to address them .Now your mothers charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen you no longer call this place home .You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that youre never going to live together again correct ?Harry nodded .So this time when you leave therell be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range .Were choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for YouKnowWho to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen .The one thing weve got on our side is that You KnowWho doesnt know were moving you tonight .Weve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry They think youre not leaving until the thirtieth .However this is YouKnowWho were dealing with so we cant just rely on him getting the date wrong hes bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case .So weve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them .They all look like they could be the place were going to hide you theyve all got some connection with the Order my house Kingsleys place Mollys Auntie Muriels you get the idea .Yeah said Harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan .Youll be going to Tonkss parents .Once youre within the boundaries of the protective enchantments weve put on their house youll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow .Any questions ?Er yes said Harry .Maybe they wont know which of the twelve secure houses Im heading for at first but wont it be sort of obvious once he performed a quick headcount fourteen of us fly off toward Tonkss parents ?Ah said Moody I forgot to mention the key point .Fourteen of us wont be flying to Tonkss parents .There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house .From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud .There was no need for him to say another word Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately .No !he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen .No way !I told them youd take it like this said Hermione with a hint of complacency .If you think Im going to let six people risk their lives !because its the first time for all of us said Ron .This is different pretending to be me Well none of us really fancy it Harry said Fred earnestly .Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever .Harry did not smile .You cant do it if I dont cooperate you need me to give you some hair .Well thats that plan scuppered said George .Obviously theres no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate .Yeah thirteen of us against one bloke whos not allowed to use magic weve got no chance said Fred .Funny said Harry really amusing .If it has to come to force then it will growled Moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry .Everyone heres overage Potter and theyre all prepared to take the risk .Mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moodys head .Lets have no more arguments .Times wearing on .I want a few of your hairs boy now .But this is mad theres no need No need !snarled Moody .With YouKnowWho out there and half the Ministry on his side ?Potter if were lucky hell have swallowed the fake bait and hell be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but hed be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out its what Id do .They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mothers charm holds but its about to break and they know the rough position of the place .Our only chance is to use decoys .Even YouKnowWho cant split himself into seven .Harry caught Hermiones eye and looked away at once .So Potter some of your hair if you please .Harry glanced at Ron who grimaced at him in a just doit sort of way .Now !barked Moody .With all of their eyes upon him Harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled .Good said Moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion .Straight in here if you please .Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid .The moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold .Ooh you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle Harry said Hermione before catching sight of Rons raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying Oh you know what I mean Goyle s potion looked like bogies .Right then fake Potters line up over here please said Moody .Ron Hermione Fred George and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunias gleaming sink .Were one short said Lupin .Here said Hagrid gruffly and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead .Ive toldjer Id sooner be a protector said Mundungus .Shut it growled Moody .As Ive already told you you spineless worm any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter not kill him .Dumbledore always said YouKnowWho would want to finish Potter in person .Itll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the Death Eatersll want to kill them .Mundungus did not look particularly reassured but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcupsized glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one .Altogether then .Ron Hermione Fred George Fleur and Mundungus drank .All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats At once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax .Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward Ron Fred and George were shrinking their hair was darkening Hermiones and Fleurs appearing to shoot backward into their skulls .Moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him .When he straightened up again there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him .Fred and George turned to each other and said together Wow were identical !I dunno though I think Im still betterlooking said Fred examining his reflection in the kettle .Bah said Fleur checking herself in the microwave door Bill dont look at me Im ideous .Those whose clothes are a bit roomy Ive got smaller here said Moody indicating the first sack and vice versa .Dont forget the glasses theres six pairs in the side pocket .And when youre dressed theres luggage in the other sack .The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things .He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away .He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own .I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo said Ron looking down at his bare chest .Harry your eyesight really is awful said Hermione as she put on glasses .Once dressed the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack .Good said Moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and luggageladen Harrys faced him .The pairs will be as follows Mundungus will be traveling with me by broom Whym I with you ?grunted the Harry nearest the back door .Because youre the one that needs watching growled Moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued Arthur and Fred Im George said the twin at whom Moody was pointing .Cant you even tell us apart when were Harry ?Sorry George Im only yanking your wand Im Fred really Enough messing around !snarled Moody .The other one George or Fred or whoever you are youre with Remus .Miss Delacour Im taking Fleur on a thestral said Bill .Shes not that fond of brooms .Fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again .Miss Granger with Kingsley again by thestral Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsleys smile Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick .Which leaves you and me Ron !said Tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him .Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione .An youre with me Harry .That all righ ?said Hagrid looking a little anxious .Well be on the bike brooms an thestrals cant take me weight see .Not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so youll be in the sidecar .Thats great said Harry not altogether truthfully .We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom said Moody who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling .Snapes had plenty of time to tell them everything about you hes never mentioned before so if we do run into any Death Eaters were betting theyll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick .All right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake Potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door I make it three minutes until were supposed to leave .No point locking the back door it wont keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking .Come on .Harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack Firebolt and Hedwigs cage before joining the others in the dark back garden .On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands Hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley Fleur onto the other by Bill .Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on .Is this it ?Is this Siriuss bike ?The very same said Hagrid beaming down at Harry .An the last time yeh was on it Harry I could fit yeh in one hand !Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar .It placed him several feet below everybody else Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car .Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwigs cage between his knees .It was extremely uncomfortable .Arthurs done a bit o tinkerin said Hagrid quite oblivious to Harrys discomfort .He settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground .Its got a few tricks up its handlebars now .Tha one was my idea .He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer .Please be careful Hagrid said Mr Weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick .Im still not sure that was advisable and its certainly only to be used in emergencies .All right then said Moody .Everyone ready please I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversions lost .Everybody mounted their brooms .Hold tight now Ron said Tonks and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist .Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life It roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate .Good luck everyone shouted Moody .See you all in about an hour at the Burrow .On the count of three .One .two .THREE .There was a great roar from the motorbike and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch He was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face .Around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past .His legs jammed into the sidecar by Hedwigs cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb .So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was .Higher and higher they climbed into the sky And then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded .At least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen oblivious Screams a blaze of green light on every side Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over .Harry lost any sense of where they were Streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life .Hedwigs cage the Firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees No HEDWIG !The broomstick spun to earth but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again .A seconds relief and then another burst of green light .The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage .No NO !The motorbike zoomed forward Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle .Hedwig Hedwig But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage .He could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount .He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were Hagrid weve got to go back weve got to go back !he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming Hedwigs cage onto the floor refusing to believe that she was dead .Hagrid TURN AROUND !My jobs ter get you there safe Harry !bellowed Hagrid and he opened the throttle .Stop STOP !Harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for Hagrid s broad back .Hagrid swerved but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them .Wriggling around he cried Stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it .Hold on Harry thisll do for em !roared Hagrid and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge .A wall a solid brick wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe .Craning his neck Harry saw it expand into being in midair .Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces .One of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up .More Killing Curses flew past Harrys head from the two remaining Death Eaters wands they were aiming for Hagrid .Harry responded with further Stunning Spells Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and Harry thought wildly of fireworks and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening Here we go again Harry hold on !yelled Hagrid and he jabbed at a second button .This time a great net burst from the bikes exhaust but the Death Eaters were ready for it .Not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up .He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it .Thisll do it Harry hold on tight !yelled Hagrid and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer .With an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust whitehot and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal .Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration .Its all righ Harry !bellowed Hagrid now thrown flat onto his back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bikes slipstream . ‘Tm on it Harry don worry !Hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella .Hagrid !No !Let me !REPAROl There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely Harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bikes flight then the sidecar began to lose height In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted Wingardium Leviosal The sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne He had but a split seconds relief however as more curses streaked past him The three Death Eaters were closing in .Im cornin Harry !Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again Crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled Impedimental The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest For a moment the man was absurdly spreadeagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier One of his fellows almost collided with him Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat Im cornin Harry Im cornin !A huge hand seized the back of Harrys robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbikes seat and found himself backto back with Hagrid .As they soared upward away from the two remaining Death Eaters Harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled Confringo He knew a dreadful gutwrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished .Harry Im sorry Im sorry moaned Hagrid I shouldnta tried ter repair it meself yehve got no room Its not a problem just keep flying !Harry shouted back as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer .As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again Hagrid swerved and zigzagged Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragonfire button again with Harry seated so insecurely .Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off .He shot another blocking jinx at them The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike Stan ExpelliarmusV Harry yelled .Thats him its him its the real one !The hooded Death Eaters shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbikes engine Next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view .Harry whats happened ?bellowed Hagrid .Where Ve they gone ?I dont know !But Harry was afraid The hooded Death Eater had shouted Its the real one !how had he known ?He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace .Where were they ?He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid s jacket .Hagrid do the dragonfire thing again lets get out of here !Hold on tight then Harry !There was a deafening screeching roar again and the whiteblue fire shot from the exhaust Harry felt himself slipping backward off what little of the seat he had Hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars I think weve lost em Harry I think weve done it !yelled Hagrid .But Harry was not convinced Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come .Why had they fallen back ?One of them had still had a wand .Its him .its the real one .They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan .Were nearly there Harry weve nearly made it !shouted Hagrid .Harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars .Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters cast from behind And then Harry saw him .Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive .Clinging on for dear life Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night .He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control Green jets of light shot past them again .Harry had no idea which way was up which down His scar was still burning he expected to die at any second .A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm NO !With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater to his horror Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees Harry heard Voldemort scream Mine It was over He could not see or hear where Voldemort was he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard Avada As the pain from Harrys scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord .He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his halfclosed eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury .The remaining Death Eater yelled Voldemort screamed No Somehow Harry found his nose an inch from the dragonfire button .He punched it with his wandfree hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground .Hagrid !Harry called holding on to the bike for dear life .Hagrid Accio Hagridl The motorbike sped up sucked toward the earth .Face level with the handlebars Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it .Behind him came another scream Your wand Selwyn give me your wand He felt Voldemort before he saw him .Looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw Voldemort preparing to curse him once more And then Voldemort vanished .Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spreadeagled on the ground below him .He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting groundtrembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond .5 FALLEN WARRIOR Hagrid ?Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand .He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment .Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead .He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid .Hagrid ?Hagrid talk to me But the dark mass did not stir .Whos there ?Is it Potter ?Are you Harry Potter ?Harry did not recognize the mans voice .Then a woman shouted Theyve crashed Ted !Crashed in the garden !Harrys head was swimming .Hagrid he repeated stupidly and his knees buckled .The next thing he knew he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm .His missing tooth had been regrown .The scar on his forehead was still throbbing .Hagrid ?He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar lamplit sitting room .His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away wet and muddy .A fairhaired bigbellied man was watching Harry anxiously .Hagrids fine son said the man the wifes seeing to him now .How are you feeling ?Anything else broken ?Ive fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm .Im Ted by the way Ted Tonks Doras father .Harry sat up too quickly Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy .Voldemort Easy now said Ted Tonks placing a hand on Harrys shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions .That was a nasty crash you just had .What happened anyway ?Something go wrong with the bike ?Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again him and his Muggle contraptions ?No said Harry as his scar pulsed like an open wound .Death Eaters loads of them we were chased Death Eaters ?said Ted sharply .What dyou mean Death Eaters ?I thought they didnt know you were being moved tonight I thought They knew said Harry .Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above .Well we know our protective charms hold then dont we ?They shouldnt be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction .Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Orders charms .He only hoped they would continue to work He imagined Voldemort a hundred yards above them as they spoke looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble .He swung his legs off the sofa he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive .He had barely stood up however when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it his face covered in mud and blood limping a little but miraculously alive .Harry !Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs .Blimey Harry how did yeh get out o that ?I thought we were both goners .Yeah me too .I cant believe Harry broke off .He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid .You !he shouted and he thrust his hand into his pocket but it was empty .Your wands here son said Ted tapping it on Harrys arm .It fell right beside you I picked it up .And thats my wife youre shouting at .Oh Im Im sorry .As she moved forward into the room Mrs Tonkss resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder .Nevertheless she looked a little haughty after Harrys exclamation .What happened to our daughter ?she asked .Hagrid said you were ambushed where is Nymphadora ?I dont know said Harry .We dont know what happened to anyone else .She and Ted exchanged looks .A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions if any of the others had died it was his fault all his fault .He had consented to the plan given them his hair .The Portkey he said remembering all of a sudden .Weve got to get back to the Burrow and find out then well be able to send you word or or Tonks will once shes Dorall be okay Dromeda said Ted .She knows her stuff shes been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors .The Portkey s through here he added to Harry .Its supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it .Yeah we do said Harry .He seized his rucksack swung it onto his shoulders .I He looked at Mrs Tonks wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere .Ill tell Tonks Dora to send word when she .Thanks for patching us up thanks for everything .I He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom .Hagrid came after them bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel .There you go son .Thats the Portkey .Mr Tonks was pointing to a small silverbacked hairbrush lying on the dressing table .Thanks said Harry reaching out to place a finger on it ready to leave .Wait a moment said Hagrid looking around .Harry wheres Hedwig ?She .she got hit said Harry .The realization crashed over him He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes .The owl had been his companion his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys .Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder .Never mind he said gruffly .Never mind .She had a great old life Hagrid !said Ted Tonks warningly as the hairbrush glowed bright blue and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time .With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward Harry was pulled into nothingness spinning uncontrollably his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr Tonks .Seconds later Harrys feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow .He heard screams .Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush Harry stood up swaying slightly and saw Mrs Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid who had also collapsed on landing clambered laboriously to his feet .Harry ?You are the real Harry ?What happened ?Where are the others ?cried Mrs Weasley .What dyou mean ?Isnt anyone else back ?Harry panted .The answer was clearly etched in Mrs Weasley s pale face .The Death Eaters were waiting for us Harry told her .We were surrounded the moment we took off they knew it was tonight I dont know what happened to anyone else four of them chased us it was all we could do to get away and then Voldemort caught up with us He could hear the selfjustifying note in his voice the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons but Thank goodness youre all right she said pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved .Havent go any brandy have yeh Molly ?asked Hagrid a little shakily .Fer medicinal purposes ?She could have summoned it by magic but as she hurried back toward the crooked house Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face .He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once .Ron and Tonks should have been back first but they missed their Portkey it came back without them she said pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby .And that one she pointed at an ancient sneaker should have been Dad and Freds they were supposed to be second .You and Hagrid were third and she checked her watch if they made it George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute .Mrs Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy which she handed to Hagrid .He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one .Mum !shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away .A blue light had appeared in the darkness It grew larger and brighter and Lupin and George appeared spinning and then falling .Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong Lupin was supporting George who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood .Harry ran forward and seized Georges legs .Together he and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room where they laid him on the sofa .As the lamplight fell across Georges head Ginny gasped and Harrys stomach lurched One of Georges ears was missing .The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet shockingly scarlet blood .No sooner had Mrs Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him none too gently back into the kitchen where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door .Oi !said Hagrid indignantly .Le go of him !Le go of Harry !Lupin ignored him .What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts ?he said giving Harry a small shake .Answer me !A a grindylow in a tank wasnt it ?Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard .Wha was tha about ?roared Hagrid .Im sorry Harry but I had to check said Lupin tersely .Weve been betrayed .Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan .You might have been an impostor .So why aren you checkin me ?panted Hagrid still struggling to fit through the door .Youre halfgiant said Lupin looking up at Hagrid .The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only .None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight said Harry .The idea was dreadful to him he could not believe it of any of them .Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didnt know which one I was in the beginning .If hed been in on the plan hed have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid .Voldemort caught up with you ?said Lupin sharply .What happened ?How did you escape ?Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true Harry how they had abandoned the chase how they must have summoned Voldemort who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonkss parents .They recognized you ?But how ?What had you done ?I .Harry tried to remember the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion .I saw Stan Shunpike .You know the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus ?And I tried to Disarm him instead of well he doesnt know what hes doing does he ?He must be Imperiused !Lupin looked aghast .Harry the time for Disarming is past !These people are trying to capture and kill you !At least Stun if you arent prepared to kill !We were hundreds of feet up !Stans not himself and if I Stunned him and hed fallen hed have died the same as if Id used Avada Kedavra !Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago Harry added defiantly .Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledores Army how to Disarm .Yes Harry said Lupin with painful restraint and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening !Forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under imminent threat of death .Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal !So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike ?said Harry angrily .Of course not said Lupin but the Death Eaters frankly most people !would have expected you to attack back !Expelliarmus is a useful spell Harry but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move and I urge you not to let it become so !Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him .I wont blast people out of my way just because theyre there said Harry .Thats Voldemorts job .Lupins retort was lost Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down it collapsed beneath him .Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies Harry addressed Lupin again .Will George be okay ?All Lupins frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question .I think so although theres no chance of replacing his ear not when its been cursed off There was a scuffling from outside .Lupin dived for the back door Harry leapt over Hagrids legs and sprinted into the yard .Two figures had appeared in the yard and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione now returning to her normal appearance and Kingsley both clutching a bent coat hanger .Hermione flung herself into Harrys arms but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them .Over Hermione s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupins chest .The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us ? ‘Harry is the best hope we have .Trust him said Lupin calmly .Kingsley turned his wand on Harry but Lupin said Its him Ive checked !All right all right !said Kingsley stowing his wand back beneath his cloak .But somebody betrayed us !They knew they knew it was tonight !So it seems replied Lupin but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys .Small comfort !snarled Kingsley .Who else is back ?Only Harry Hagrid George and me .Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand .What happened to you ?Lupin asked Kingsley .Followed by five injured two mightve killed one Kingsley reeled off and we saw YouKnowWho as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly .Remus he can Fly supplied Harry .I saw him too he came after Hagrid and me .So thats why he left to follow you !said Kingsley .I couldnt understand why hed vanished .But what made him change targets ?Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike said Lupin .Stan ?repeated Hermione .But I thought he was in Azkaban ?Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh .Hermione theres obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up .Traverss hood fell off when I cursed him hes supposed to be inside too .But what happened to you Remus ?Wheres George ?He lost an ear said Lupin .Lost an ?repeated Hermione in a high voice .Snapes work said Lupin .Snape ?shouted Harry .You didnt say He lost his hood during the chase .Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snapes .I wish I could say Id paid him back in kind but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood .Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky .There was no sign of movement the stars stared back unblinking indifferent unobscured by flying friends .Where was Ron ?Where were Fred and Mr Weasley ?Where were Bill Fleur Tonks MadEye and Mundungus ?Harry give us a hand !called Hagrid hoarsely from the door in which he was stuck again .Glad of something to do Harry pulled him free then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room where Mrs Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George .Mrs Weasley had staunched his bleeding now and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean gaping hole where Georges ear had been .How is he ?Mrs Weasley looked around and said I cant make it grow back not when its been removed by Dark Magic .But it could have been so much worse .Hes alive .Yeah said Harry .Thank God .Did I hear someone else in the yard ?Ginny asked .Hermione and Kingsley said Harry .Thank goodness Ginny whispered .They looked at each other Harry wanted to hug her hold on to her he did not even care much that Mrs Weasley was there but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen .Ill prove who I am Kingsley after Ive seen my son now back off if you know whats good for you !Harry had never heard Mr Weasley shout like that before .He burst into the living room his bald patch gleaming with sweat his spectacles askew Fred right behind him both pale but uninjured .Arthur !sobbed Mrs Weasley .Oh thank goodness !How is he ?Mr Weasley dropped to his knees beside George .For the first time since Harry had known him Fred seemed to be lost for words .He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twins wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing .Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their fathers arrival George stirred .How do you feel Georgie ?whispered Mrs Weasley .Georges fingers groped for the side of his head .Saintlike he murmured .Whats wrong with him ?croaked Fred looking terrified .Is his mind affected ?Saintlike repeated George opening his eyes and looking up at his brother .You see .Im holy .Hole v Fred geddit ?Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever .Color flooded Freds pale face .Pathetic he told George .Pathetic !With the whole wide world of earrelated humor before you you go for holey ?Ah well said George grinning at his tearsoaked mother .Youll be able to tell us apart now anyway Mum .He looked around .Hi Harry you are Harry right ?Yeah I am said Harry moving closer to the sofa .Well at least we got you back okay said George .Why arent Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed ?Theyre not back yet George said Mrs Weasley .Georges grin faded .Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside .As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice Ron and Tonks should be back by now .They didnt have a long journey Auntie Muriels not that far from here .Harry said nothing .He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow but now it enveloped him seeming to crawl over his skin throbbing in his chest clogging his throat .As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard Ginny took his hand .Kingsley was striding backward and forward glancing up at the sky every time he turned .Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago .Hagrid Hermione and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder gazing upward in silence .None of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil .The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years .The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground Its them !screamed Hermione .Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere .Remus !Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupins arms .His face was set and white He seemed unable to speak .Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione .Youre okay he mumbled before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly .I thought I thought M all right said Ron patting her on the back .M fine .Ron was great said Tonks warmly relinquishing her hold on Lupin .Wonderful .Stunned one of the Death Eaters straight to the head and when youre aiming at a moving target from a flying broom You did ?said Hermione gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck .Always the tone of surprise he said a little grumpily breaking free .Are we the last back ?No said Ginny were still waiting for Bill and Fleur and MadEye and Mundungus .Im going to tell Mum and Dad youre okay Ron She ran back inside .So what kept you ?What happened ?Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks .Bellatrix said Tonks .She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry Remus she tried very hard to kill me .I just wish Id got her I owe Bellatrix .But we definitely injured Rodolphus .Then we got to Rons Auntie Muriels and wed missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us A muscle was jumping in Lupins jaw .He nodded but seemed unable to say anything else .So what happened to you lot ?Tonks asked turning to Harry Hermione and Kingsley .They recounted the stories of their own journeys but all the time the continued absence of Bill Fleur Mad Eye and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost its icy bite harder and harder to ignore .Im going to have to get back to Downing Street I should have been there an hour ago said Kingsley finally after a last sweeping gaze at the sky .Let me know when theyre back .Lupin nodded .With a wave to the others Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate .Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrows boundaries .Mr and Mrs Weasley came racing down the back steps Ginny behind them .Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks .Thank you said Mrs Weasley for our sons .Dont be silly Molly said Tonks at once .Hows George ?asked Lupin .Whats wrong with him ?piped up Ron .Hes lost But the end of Mrs Weasley s sentence was drowned in a general outcry A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them .Bill and Fleur slid from its back windswept but unhurt .Bill !Thank God thank God Mrs Weasley ran forward but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory .Looking directly at his father he said MadEyes dead .Nobody spoke nobody moved .Harry felt as though something inside him was falling falling through the earth leaving him forever .We saw it said Bill Fleur nodded tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window .It happened just after we broke out of the circle MadEye and Dung were close by us they were heading north too .Voldemort he can fly went straight for them .Dung panicked I heard him cry out MadEye tried to stop him but he Disapparated .Voldemorts curse hit MadEye full in the face he fell backward off his broom and there was nothing we could do nothing we had half a dozen of them on our own tail Bills voice broke .Of course you couldnt have done anything said Lupin .They all stood looking at each other .Harry could not quite comprehend it .MadEye dead it could not be . .MadEye so tough so brave the consummate survivor .At last it seemed to dawn on everyone though nobody said it that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore and in silence they followed Mr and Mrs Weasley back into the Burrow and into the living room where Fred and George were laughing together .Whats wrong ?said Fred scanning their faces as they entered .Whats happened ?Whos ?MadEye said Mr Weasley .Dead .The twins grins turned to grimaces of shock .Nobody seemed to know what to do .Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief She had been close to MadEye Harry knew his favorite and his protegee at the Ministry of Magic .Hagrid who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space was dabbing at his eyes with his tableclothsized handkerchief .Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of firewhisky and some glasses .Here he said and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them holding the thirteenth aloft .MadEye .MadEye they all said and drank .MadEye echoed Hagrid a little late with a hiccup .The firewhisky seared Harrys throat .It seemed to burn feeling back into him dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage .So Mundungus disappeared ?said Lupin who had drained his own glass in one .The atmosphere changed at once .Everybody looked tense watching Lupin both wanting him to go on it seemed to Harry and slightly afraid of what they might hear .I know what youre thinking said Bill and I wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didnt they ?But Mundungus cant have betrayed us .They didnt know there would be seven Harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case youve forgotten it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery .Why wouldnt he have told them the essential point ?I think Dung panicked its as simple as that .He didnt want to come in the first place but MadEye made him and YouKnowWho went straight for them .It was enough to make anyone panic .YouKnowWho acted exactly as MadEye expected him to sniffed Tonks .MadEye said hed expect the real Harry to be with the toughest most skilled Aurors .He chased MadEye first and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley .Yes and zat eez all very good snapped Fleur but still eet does not explain ow zey knew we were moving Arry tonight does eet ?Somebody must ave been careless .Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider .It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ole plan .She glared around at them all tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face silently daring any of them to contradict her .Nobody did .The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief .Harry glanced at Hagrid who had just risked his own life to save Harrys Hagrid whom he loved whom he trusted who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragons egg .No Harry said aloud and they all looked at him surprised The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice .I mean .if somebody made a mistake Harry went on and let something slip I know they didnt mean to do it .Its not their fault he repeated again a little louder than he would usually have spoken .Weve got to trust each other .I trust all of you I dont think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort .More silence followed his words .They were all looking at him Harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for something to do .As he drank he thought of MadEye .MadEye had always been scathing about Dumbledores willingness to trust people .Well said Harry said Fred unexpectedly .Yeah ear ear said George with half a glance at Fred the corner of whose mouth twitched .Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry .It was close to pitying .You think Im a fool ?demanded Harry .No I think youre like James said Lupin who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends .Harry knew what Lupin was getting at that his father had been betrayed by his friend Peter Pettigrew .He felt irrationally angry .He wanted to argue but Lupin had turned away from him set down his glass upon a side table and addressed Bill Theres work to do .I can ask Kingsley whether No said Bill at once Ill do it Ill come .Where are you going ?said Tonks and Fleur together .MadEyes body said Lupin .We need to recover it .Cant it ?began Mrs Weasley with an appealing look at Bill .Wait ?said Bill .Not unless youd rather the Death Eaters took it ?Nobody spoke .Lupin and Bill said goodbye and left .The rest of them now dropped into chairs all except for Harry who remained standing .The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence .Ive got to go too said Harry .Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him .Dont be silly Harry said Mrs Weasley .What are you talking about ?I cant stay here .He rubbed his forehead it was prickling again it had not hurt like this for more than a year .Youre all in danger while Im here .I dont want But dont be so silly !said Mrs Weasley .The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked .And Fleurs agreed to get married here rather than in France weve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you She did not understand she was making him feel worse not better .If Voldemort finds out Im here But why should he ?asked Mrs Weasley .There are a dozen places you might be now Harry said Mr Weasley .Hes got no way of knowing which safe house youre in .Its not me Im worried for !said Harry .We know that said Mr Weasley quietly but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left .Yer not goin anywhere growled Hagrid .Blimey Harry after all we wen through ter get you here ?Yeah what about my bleeding ear ?said George hoisting himself up on his cushions .I know that MadEye wouldnt want I KNOW !Harry bellowed .He felt beleaguered and blackmailed Did they think he did not know what they had done for him didnt they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now before they had to suffer any more on his behalf ?There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb and which was broken at last by Mrs Weasley .Wheres Hedwig Harry ?she said coaxingly .We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat .His insides clenched like a fist .He could not tell her the truth .He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering .Wait till it gets out yeh did it again Harry said Hagrid .Escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh !It wasnt me said Harry flatly .It was my wand .My wand acted of its own accord .After a few moments Hermione said gently But thats impossible Harry .You mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively .No said Harry .The bike was falling I couldnt have told you where Voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasnt even a spell I recognized .Ive never made gold flames appear before .Often said Mr Weasley when youre in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of .Small children often find before theyre trained It wasnt like that said Harry through gritted teeth .His scar was burning He felt angry and frustrated he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemorts .No one said anything .He knew that they did not believe him .Now that he came to think of it he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before .His scar seared with pain it was all he could do not to moan aloud .Muttering about fresh air he set down his glass and left the room .As he crossed the dark yard the great skeletal thestral looked up rustled its enormous batlike wings then resumed its grazing .Harry stopped at the gate into the garden staring out at its overgrown plants rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore .Dumbledore would have believed him he knew it .Dumbledore would have known how and why Harrys wand had acted independently because Dumbledore always had the answers he had known about wands had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and Voldemorts .But Dumbledore like MadEye like Sirius like his parents like his poor owl all were gone where Harry could never talk to them again .He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky .And then out of nowhere the pain in his scar peaked .As he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes a voice screamed inside his head .You told me the problem would be solved by using anothers wand And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor screaming a horrible drawnout scream a scream of unendurable agony .No !No !I beg you I beg you .You lied to Lord Voldemort Ollivander !I did not .I swear I did not .You sought to help Potter to help him escape me !I swear I did not .I believed a different wand would work .Explain then what happened .Luciuss wand is destroyed !I cannot understand .The connection .exists only .between your two wands .Lies !Please .I beg you .And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort s surge of vicious anger saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony Harry ?It was over as quickly as it had come Harry stood shaking in the darkness clutching the gate into the garden his heart racing his scar still tingling .It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side .Harry come back in the house Hermione whispered .You arent still thinking of leaving ?Yeah youve got to stay mate said Ron thumping Harry on the back .Are you all right ?Hermione asked close enough now to look into Harrys face .You look awful !Well said Harry shakily I probably look better than Ollivander .When he had finished telling them what he had seen Ron looked appalled but Hermione downright terrified .But it was supposed to have stopped !Your scar it wasnt supposed to do this anymore !You mustnt let that connection open up again Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind !When he did not reply she gripped his arm .Harry hes taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world !Dont let him inside your head too !6 THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS The shock of losing MadEye hung over the house in the days that followed Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members who passed in and out to relay news .Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible .Well you cant do anything about the Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes till youre seventeen .Youve still got the Trace on you .And we can plan here as well as anywhere cant we ?Or he dropped his voice to a whisper dyou reckon you already know where the YouKnowWhats are ?No Harry admitted .I think Hermiones been doing a bit of research said Ron .She said she was saving it for when you got here .They were sitting at the breakfast table Mr Weasley and Bill had just left for work .Mrs Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath .The Tracell break on the thirty first said Harry .That means I only need to stay here four days .Then I can Five days Ron corrected him firmly .Weve got to stay for the wedding .Theyll kill us if we miss it .Harry understood they to mean Fleur and Mrs Weasley .Its one extra day said Ron when Harry looked mutinous .Dont they realize how important ?Course they dont said Ron .They havent got a clue .And now you mention it I wanted to talk to you about that .Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs Weasley was not returning yet then leaned in closer to Harry .Mums been trying to get it out of Hermione and me .What were off to do .Shell try you next so brace yourself .Dad and Lupin ve both asked as well but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it .Not Mum though .Shes determined .Rons prediction came true within hours .Shortly before lunch Mrs Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone mans sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack .Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen she started .Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts she began in a light casual tone .Oh said Harry .Well yeah .We are .The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner wringing out what looked like one of Mr Weasleys vests .May I ask why you are abandoning your education ?said Mrs Weasley .Well Dumbledore left me .stuff to do mumbled Harry .Ron and Hermione know about it and they want to come too .What sort of ‘stuff ?Im sorry I cant Well frankly I think Arthur and I have a right to know and Im sure Mr and Mrs Granger would agree !said Mrs Weasley .Harry had been afraid of the concerned parent attack .He forced himself to look directly into her eyes noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginnys .This did not help .Dumbledore didnt want anyone else to know Mrs Weasley .Im sorry .Ron and Hermione dont have to come its their choice I dont see that you have to go either !she snapped dropping all pretense now .Youre barely of age any of you !Its utter nonsense if Dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole Order at his command !Harry you must have misunderstood him .Probably he was telling you something he wanted done and you took it to mean that he wanted you I didnt misunderstand said Harry flatly .Its got to be me .He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying which was patterned with golden bulrushes .And thats not mine I dont support Puddlemere United .Oh of course not said Mrs Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone .I should have realized .Well Harry while weve still got you here you wont mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleurs wedding will you ?Theres still so much to do .No I of course not said Harry disconcerted by this sudden change of subject .Sweet of you she replied and she smiled as she left the scullery .From that moment on Mrs Weasley kept Harry Ron and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think .The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of MadEye and the terrors of their recent journey .After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning of colormatching favors ribbons and flowers of de gnoming the garden and helping Mrs Weasley cook vast batches of canapes however Harry started to suspect her of a different motive .All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him Ron and Hermione away from one another he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander .I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning shell be able to delay you leaving Ginny told Harry in an undertone as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay .And then what does she thinks going to happen ?Harry muttered .Someone else might kill off Voldemort while shes holding us here making volau vents ?He had spoken without thinking and saw Ginnys face whiten .So its true ?she said .Thats what youre trying to do ?I not I was joking said Harry evasively .They stared at each other and there was something more than shock in Ginnys expression .Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds .He was sure she was remembering them too .Both of them jumped as the door opened and Mr Weasley Kingsley and Bill walked in .They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now because the Burrow had replaced number twelve Grimmauld Place as the headquarters .Mr Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore their SecretKeeper each of the people to whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Places location had become a Secret Keeper in turn .And as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm .Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody .We cant expect it to hold much longer .But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now ?asked Harry .Well MadEye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again .We hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we cant be sure .It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky .The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks .Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people .He was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken .No news about MadEye ?Harry asked Bill .Nothing replied Bill .They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body .It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the darkness and the confusion of the battle .The Daily Prophet hasnt said a word about him dying or about finding the body Bill went on .But that doesnt mean much .Its keeping a lot quiet these days .And they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters ?Harry called across the table to Mr Weasley who shook his head .Because they know I had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me ?The latter I think .Scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that YouKnowWho is as powerful as he is nor that Azkabans seen a mass breakout .Yeah why tell the public the truth ?said Harry clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out white against his skin I must not tell lies .Isnt anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him ?asked Ron angrily .Of course Ron but people are terrified Mr Weasley replied terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked !There are nasty rumors going around I for one dont believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned .She hasnt been seen for weeks now .Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day I just hope hes working on a plan .There was a pause in which Mrs Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart .We must decide ow you will be disguised Arry said Fleur once everyone had pudding .For ze wedding she added when he looked confused .Of course none of our guests are Death Eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ave ad champagne .From this Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid .Yes good point said Mrs Weasley from the top of the table where she sat spectacles perched on the end of her nose scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment .Now Ron have you cleaned out your room yet ?Why ?exclaimed Ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother .Why does my room have to be cleaned out ?Harry and I are fine with it the way it is !We are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time young man And are they getting married in my bedroom ?asked Ron furiously .No !So why in the name of Merlins saggy left Dont talk to your mother like that said Mr Weasley firmly .And do as youre told .Ron scowled at both his parents then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart .I can help some of its my mess Harry told Ron but Mrs Weasley cut across him .No Harry dear Id much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens and Hermione Id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning .But as it turned out there was very little to do for the chickens .Theres no need to er mention it to Molly Mr Weasley told Harry blocking his access to the coop but er Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Siriuss bike and er Im hiding thats to say keeping it in here .Fantastic stuff Theres an exhaust gaskin as I believe its called the most magnificent battery and itll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work .Im going to try and put it all back together again when Mollys not I mean when Ive got time .When they returned to the house Mrs Weasley was nowhere to be seen so Harry slipped upstairs to Rons attic bedroom .Im doing it Im doing !Oh its you said Ron in relief as Harry entered the room .Ron lay back down on the bed which he had evidently just vacated .The room was just as messy as it had been all week the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner her fluffy ginger cat Crookshanks at her feet sorting books some of which Harry recognized as his own into two enormous piles .Hi Harry she said as he sat down on his camp bed .And how did you manage to get away ?Oh Rons mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday said Hermione .She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other .We were just talking about MadEye Ron told Harry .I reckon he might have survived .But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse said Harry .Yeah but Bill was under attack too said Ron .How can he be sure what he saw ?Even if the Killing Curse missed MadEye still fell about a thousand feet said Hermione now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand .He could have used a Shield Charm Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand said Harry .Well all right if you want him to be dead said Ron grumpily punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape .Of course we dont want him to be dead !said Hermione looking shocked .Its dreadful that hes dead !But were being realistic !For the first time Harry imagined MadEyes body broken as Dumbledores had been yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket .He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh .The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves thats why no ones found him said Ron wisely .Yeah said Harry .Like Barty Crouch turned into a bone and buried in Hagrids front garden .They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him Dont !squealed Hermione .Startled Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellmans Syllabary .Oh no said Harry struggling to get up from the old camp bed .Hermione I wasnt trying to upset But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings Ron bounded off the bed and got there first .One arm around Hermione he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revoltinglooking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier .Hastily pulling out his wand he pointed it at the rag and said Tergeo .The wand siphoned off most of the grease .Looking rather pleased with himself Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione .Oh .thanks Ron .Im sorry .She blew her nose and hiccuped .Its just so awfful isnt it ?R right after Dumbledore .I jjust nnever imagined MadEye dying somehow he seemed so tough !Yeah I know said Ron giving her a squeeze .But you know what hed say to us if he was here ? ‘Cconstant vigilance said Hermione mopping her eyes .Thats right said Ron nodding .Hed tell us to learn from what happened to him .And what Ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit Mundungus .Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books .A second later Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot .The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Rons ankle .Im sorry Im sorry !Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Rons leg and retied it shut .What are you doing with all those books anyway ?Ron asked limping back to his bed .Just trying to decide which ones to take with us said Hermione .When were looking for the Horcruxes .Oh of course said Ron clapping a hand to his forehead .I forgot well be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library .Ha ha said Hermione looking down at Spellmans Syllabary .I wonder .will we need to translate runes ?Its possible .I think wed better take it to be safe .She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts A History .Listen said Harry .He had sat up straight .Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance .I know you said after Dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me Harry began .Here he goes Ron said to Hermione rolling his eyes .As we knew he would she sighed turning back to the books .You know I think I will take Hogwarts A History .Even if were not going back there I dont think Id feel right if I didnt have it with Listen !said Harry again .No Harry you listen said Hermione .Were coming with you .That was decided months ago years really .But Shut up Ron advised him .are you sure youve thought this through ?Harry persisted .Lets see said Hermione slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look .Ive been packing for days so were ready to leave at a moments notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling MadEyes whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Rons mums nose .Ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins and that their lifes ambition is to move to Australia which they have now done .Thats to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me or you because unfortunately Ive told them quite a bit about you .Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes Ill find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment .If I dont well I think Ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy .Wendell and Monica Wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter you see .Hermiones eyes were swimming with tears again .Ron got back off the bed put his arm around her once more and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact .Harry could not think of anything to say not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact .I Hermione Im sorry I didnt Didnt realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you ?Well we do .Ron show Harry what youve done .Nah hes just eaten said Ron .Go on he needs to know !Oh all right .Harry come here .For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door .Cmon .Why ?Harry asked following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing .Descendo muttered Ron pointing his wand at the low ceiling .A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet .A horrible half sucking halfmoaning sound came out of the square hole along with an unpleasant smell like open drains .Thats your ghoul isnt it ?asked Harry who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence .Yeah it is said Ron climbing the ladder .Come and have a look at him .Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space .His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open .But it .it looks .do ghouls normally wear pajamas ?No said Ron .Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules .Harry contemplated the thing slightly revolted .It was human in shape and size and was wearing what now that Harrys eyes became used to the darkness was clearly an old pair of Rons pajamas .He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters .Hes me see ?said Ron .No said Harry .I dont .Ill explain it back in my room the smells getting to me said Ron .They climbed back down the ladder which Ron returned to the ceiling and rejoined Hermione who was still sorting books .Once weve left the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room said Ron .I think hes really looking forward to it well its hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool but he nods a lot when you mention it .Anyway hes going to be me with spattergroit .Good eh ?Harry merely looked his confusion .It is !said Ron clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan .Look when we three dont turn up at Hogwarts again everyones going to think Hermione and I must be with you right ?Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are .But hopefully itll look like Ive gone away with Mum and Dad a lot of Muggleborns are talking about going into hiding at the moment said Hermione .We cant hide my whole family itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their jobs said Ron .So were going to put out the story that Im seriously ill with spattergroit which is why I cant go back to school .If anyone comes calling to investigate Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules .Spattergroit s really contagious so theyre not going to want to go near him .It wont matter that he cant say anything either because apparently you cant once the fungus has spread to your uvula .And your mum and dad are in on this plan ?asked Harry .Dad is .He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul .Mum .well youve seen what shes like .She wont accept were going till weve gone .There was silence in the room broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other .Ron sat watching her and Harry looked from one to the other unable to say anything .The measures they had taken to protect their families made him realize more than anything else could have done that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be .He wanted to tell them what that meant to him but he simply could not find words important enough .Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs Weasley shouting from four floors below .Ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring said Ron .I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding .Fleurs sisters a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and shes too young to come on her own said Hermione as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee .Well guests arent going to help Mums stress levels said Ron .What we really need to decide said Hermione tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe is where were going after we leave here .I know you said you wanted to go to Godrics Hollow first Harry and I understand why but .well .shouldnt we make the Horcruxes our priority ?If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were Id agree with you said Harry who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godrics Hollow .His parents graves were only part of the attraction He had a strong though inexplicable feeling that the place held answers for him .Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemorts Killing Curse now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened wanting to understand .Dont you think theres a possibility that Voldemorts keeping a watch on Godrics Hollow ?Hermione asked .He might expect you to go back and visit your parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like ?This had not occurred to Harry .While he struggled to find a counterargument Ron spoke up evidently following his own train of thought .This R .A .B .person he said .You know the one who stole the real locket ?Hermione nodded .He said in his note he was going to destroy it didnt he ?Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R .A .B .s note was still folded . ‘ I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can Harry read out .Well what if he did finish it off ?said Ron .Or she interposed Hermione .Whichever said Ron itd be one less for us to do !Yes but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket arent we ?said Hermione to find out whether or not its destroyed .And once we get hold of it how do you destroy a Horcrux ?asked Ron .Well said Hermione Ive been researching that .How ?asked Harry .I didnt think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library ?There werent said Hermione who had turned pink .Dumbledore removed them all but he he didnt destroy them .Ron sat up straight wideeyed .How in the name of Merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books ?It it wasnt stealing !said Hermione looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation .They were still library books even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves .Anyway if he really didnt want anyone to get at them Im sure he would have made it much harder to Get to the point !said Ron .Well .it was easy said Hermione in a small voice .I just did a Summoning Charm .You know Accio .And they zoomed out of Dumbledore s study window right into the girls dormitory .But when did you do this ?Harry asked regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity .Just after his Dumbledores funeral said Hermione in an even smaller voice .Right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes .When I went back upstairs to get my things it it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be .and I was alone in there .so I tried .and it worked .They flew straight in through the open window and I I packed them .She swallowed and then said imploringly I cant believe Dumbledore would have been angry its not as though were going to use the information to make a Horcrux is it ?Can you hear us complaining ?said Ron .Where are these books anyway ?Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume bound in faded black leather .She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead .This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux .Secrets of the Darkest Art its a horrible book really awful full of evil magic .I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library .If he didnt do it until he was headmaster I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here .Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux then if hed already read that ?asked Ron .He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven said Harry .Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them .I think youre right Hermione that could easily have been where he got the information .And the more Ive read about them said Hermione the more horrible they seem and the less I can believe that he actually made six .It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and thats just by making one Horcrux !Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond usual evil .Isnt there any way of putting yourself back together ?Ron asked .Yes said Hermione with a hollow smile but it would be excruciatingly painful .Why ?How do you do it ?asked Harry .Remorse said Hermione .Youve got to really feel what youve done .Theres a footnote .Apparently the pain of it can destroy you .I cant see Voldemort attempting it somehow can you ?No said Ron before Harry could answer .So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book ?Yes said Hermione now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them .From all that Ive read what Harry did to Riddles diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux .What stabbing it with a basilisk fang ?asked Harry .Oh well lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then said Ron .I was wondering what we were going to do with them .It doesnt have to be a basilisk fang said Hermione patiently .It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux cant repair itself .Basilisk venom only has one antidote and its incredibly rare □ phoenix tears said Harry nodding .Exactly said Hermione .Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you .Thats a problem were going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a Horcrux wont do the trick .Youve got to put it beyond magical repair .But even if we wreck the thing it lives in said Ron why cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else ?Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being .Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused Hermione hurried on Look if I picked up a sword right now Ron and ran you through with it I wouldnt damage your soul at all .Which would be a real comfort to me Im sure said Ron .Harry laughed .It should be actually !But my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched said Hermione .But its the other way round with a Horcrux .The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival .It cant exist without it .That diary sort of died when I stabbed it said Harry remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages and the screams of the piece of Voldemorts soul as it vanished .And once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist .Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new .Hang on said Ron frowning .The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny wasnt it ?How does that work then ?While the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object .I dont mean holding it for too long its nothing to do with touching it she added before Ron could speak .I mean close emotionally .Ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable .Youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux .I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring ?said Harry .Why didnt I ask him ?I never really .His voice tailed away He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore and of how since the headmaster had died it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive to find out more .to find out everything .The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wallshaking crash .Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art Crookshanks streaked under the bed hissing indignantly Ron jumped off the bed skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper and smacked his head on the opposite wall and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs Weasley whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage .Im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering she said her voice trembling .Im sure you all need your rest .but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help .Oh yes said Hermione looking terrified as she leapt to her feet sending books flying in every direction we will .were sorry .With an anguished look at Harry and Ron Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs Weasley .Its like being a houseelf complained Ron in an undertone still massaging his head as he and Harry followed .Except without the job satisfaction .The sooner this weddings over the happier Ill be .Yeah said Harry then well have nothing to do except find Horcruxes .Itll be like a holiday wont it ?Ron started to laugh but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs Weasleys room stopped quite abruptly .The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven oclock .Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleurs family by this time and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks and Harry attempted to flatten his hair .Once they had all been deemed smart enough they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors .Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy .The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots though there was no breeze the leaves waved lazily giving an attractive rippling effect .The chickens had been shut away the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned plucked and generally spruced up although Harry who liked it in its overgrown state thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes .He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place .Mr Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill where they were to arrive by Portkey .The first sound of their approach was an unusually highpitched laugh which turned out to be coming from Mr Weasley who appeared at the gate moments later laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long leafgreen robes who could only be Fleurs mother .Maman !cried Fleur rushing forward to embrace her .Papa !Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife he was a head shorter and extremely plump with a little pointed black beard .However he looked goodnatured .Bouncing toward Mrs Weasley on highheeled boots he kissed her twice on each cheek leaving her flustered .You ave been to much trouble he said in a deep voice .Fleur tells us you ave been working very ard .Oh its been nothing nothing !trilled Mrs Weasley .No trouble at all !Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes .Dear lady !said Monsieur Delacour still holding Mrs Weasleys hand between his own two plump ones and beaming .We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families !Let me present my wife Apolline .Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs Weasley too .Enchantee she said .Your usband as been telling us such amusing stories !Mr Weasley gave a maniacal laugh Mrs Weasley threw him a look upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend .And of course you ave met my leetle daughter Gabrielle !said Monsieur Delacour .Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature eleven years old with waistlength hair of pure silvery blonde she gave Mrs Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her then threw Harry a glowing look batting her eyelashes .Ginny cleared her throat loudly .Well come in do !said Mrs Weasley brightly and she ushered the Delacours into the house with many No please !s and After you !s and Not at all !s .The Delacours it soon transpired were helpful pleasant guests .They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding .Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids shoes Charmanti Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice Gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French .On the downside the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people .Mr and Mrs Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom .Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percys old room and Bill would be sharing with Charlie his best man once Charlie arrived from Romania .Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that Harry Ron and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house .But she still wont leave us alone !snarled Ron as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms .Oh good youve fed the chickens she called as she approached them .Wed better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow .to put up the tent for the wedding she explained pausing to lean against the henhouse .She looked exhausted .Millamants Magic Marquees .theyre very good Bills escorting them .Youd better stay inside while theyre here Harry .I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place .Im sorry said Harry humbly .Oh dont be silly dear !said Mrs Weasley at once .I didnt mean well your safetys much more important !Actually Ive been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday Harry .Seventeen after all its an important day .I dont want a fuss said Harry quickly envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all .Really Mrs Weasley just a normal dinner would be fine .Its the day before the wedding .Oh well if youre sure dear .Ill invite Remus and Tonks shall I ?And how about Hagrid ?Thatd be great said Harry .But please dont go to loads of trouble .Not at all not at all .Its no trouble .She looked at him a long searching look then smiled a little sadly straightened up and walked away .Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her .7 THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE He was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn .Far below swathed in mist was the shadow of a small town .Was the man he sought down there the man he needed so badly he could think of little else the man who held the answer the answer to his problem . ?Oi wake up .Harry opened his eyes .He was lying again on the camp bed in Rons dingy attic room .The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy .Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing .The scar on Harrys forehead was prickling .You were muttering in your sleep .Was I ?Yeah . ‘Gregorovitch .You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch .Harry was not wearing his glasses Rons face appeared slightly blurred .Whos Gregorovitch ?I dunno do I ?You were the one saying it .Harry rubbed his forehead thinking .He had a vague idea he had heard the name before but he could not think where .I think Voldemorts looking for him .Poor bloke said Ron fervently .Harry sat up still rubbing his scar now wide awake .He tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley .I think hes abroad .Who Gregorovitch ?Voldemort .I think hes somewhere abroad looking for Gregorovitch .It didnt look like anywhere in Britain .You reckon you were seeing into his mind again ?Ron sounded worried .Do me a favor and dont tell Hermione said Harry .Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep .He gazed up at little Pigwidgeons cage thinking .Why was the name Gregorovitch familiar ?I think he said slowly hes got something to do with Quidditch .Theres some connection but I cant I cant think what it is .Quidditch ?said Ron .Sure youre not thinking of Gorgovitch ?Who ?Dragomir Gorgovitch Chaser transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago .Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season .No said Harry .Im definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch .I try not to either said Ron .Well happy birthday anyway .Wow thats right I forgot !Im seventeen !Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses and said Accio Glasses !Although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye .Slick snorted Ron .Reveling in the removal of his Trace Harry sent Rons possessions flying around the room causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage .Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand and purely for the pleasure of it turned the orange robes on Rons Chudley Cannons posters bright blue .Id do your fly by hand though Ron advised Harry sniggering when Harry immediately checked it .Heres your present .Unwrap it up here its not for my mothers eyes .A book ?said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel .Bit of a departure from tradition isnt it ?This isnt your average book said Ron .Its pure gold Twelve FailSafe Ways to Charm Witches .Explains everything you need to know about girls .If only Id had this last year Id have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I wouldve known how to get going with .Well Fred and George gave me a copy and Ive learned a lot .Youd be surprised its not all about wandwork either .When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table .Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts while Mrs Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan .Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth Harry said Mrs Weasley beaming at him .He had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner .Thats our present on top .Harry sat down took the square parcel she had indicated and unwrapped it .Inside was a watch very like the one Mr and Mrs Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth it was gold with stars circling around the face instead of hands .Its traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age said Mrs Weasley watching him anxiously from beside the cooker .Im afraid that one isnt new like Rons it was actually my brother Fabians and he wasnt terribly careful with his possessions its a bit dented on the back but The rest of her speech was lost Harry had got up and hugged her .He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her then waved her wand in a slightly random way causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor .Happy birthday Harry !said Hermione hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile .Its not much but I hope you like it .What did you get him ?she added to Ron who seemed not to hear her .Come on then open Hermiones !said Ron .She had bought him a new Sneakoscope .The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur Ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ave Monsieur Delacour assured him but you must tell it clearly what you want .ozzerwise you might find you ave a leetle less hair zan you would like .chocolates from the Delacours and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George .Harry Ron and Hermione did not linger at the table as the arrival of Madame Delacour Fleur and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded .Ill pack these for you Hermione said brightly taking Harrys presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs .Im nearly done Im just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash Ron Rons splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the firstfloor landing .Harry will you come in here a moment ?It was Ginny .Ron came to an abrupt halt but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs .Feeling nervous Harry followed Ginny into her room .He had never been inside it before .It was small but bright .There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall and a picture of Gwenog Jones Captain of the allwitch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies on the other .A desk stood facing the open window which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played twoaside Quidditch with Ron and Hermione and which now housed a large pearly white marquee .The golden flag on top was level with Ginnys window .Ginny looked up into Harrys face took a deep breath and said Happy seventeenth .Yeah .thanks .She was looking at him steadily he however found it difficult to look back at her it was like gazing into a brilliant light .Nice view he said feebly pointing toward the window .She ignored this .He could not blame her .I couldnt think what to get you she said .You didnt have to get me anything .She disregarded this too .I didnt know what would be useful .Nothing too big because you wouldnt be able to take it with you .He chanced a glance at her .She was not tearful that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny she was rarely weepy .He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up .She took a step closer to him .So then I thought Id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing .I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest .Theres the silver lining Ive been looking for she whispered and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before and Harry was kissing her back and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world Ginny the feel of her one hand at her back and one in her long sweetsmelling hair The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart .Oh said Ron pointedly .Sorry .Ron !Hermione was just behind him slightly out of breath .There was a strained silence then Ginny said in a flat little voice Well happy birthday anyway Harry .Rons ears were scarlet Hermione looked nervous .Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble .All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny for staying well away from her seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron and all happy forgetfulness was gone .He looked at Ginny wanting to say something though he hardly knew what but she had turned her back on him .He thought that she might have succumbed for once to tears .He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron .Ill see you later he said and followed the other two out of the bedroom .Ron marched downstairs through the stillcrowded kitchen and into the yard and Harry kept pace with him all the way Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared .Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn Ron rounded on Harry .You ditched her .What are you doing now messing her around ?Im not messing her around said Harry as Hermione caught up with them .Ron But Ron held up a hand to silence her .She was really cut up when you ended it So was I .You know why I stopped it and it wasnt because I wanted to .Yeah but you go snogging her now and shes just going to get her hopes up again Shes not an idiot she knows it cant happen shes not expecting us to to end up married or As he said it a vivid picture formed in Harrys mind of Ginny in a white dress marrying a tall faceless and unpleasant stranger .In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him Her future was free and unencumbered whereas his .he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead .If you keep groping her every chance you get It wont happen again said Harry harshly .The day was cloudless but he felt as though the sun had gone in .Okay ?Ron looked half resentful half sheepish he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment then said Right then well thats .yeah .Ginny did not seek another onetoone meeting with Harry for the rest of the day nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room .Nevertheless Charlies arrival came as a relief to Harry .It provided a distraction watching Mrs Weasley force Charlie into a chair raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut .As Harrys birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrows kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie Lupin Tonks and Hagrid several tables were placed end to end in the garden .Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number 17 to hang in midair over the guests .Thanks to Mrs Weasleys ministrations Georges wound was neat and clean but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head despite the twins many jokes about it .Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes .Nice said Ron as with one final flourish of her wand Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold .Youve really got an eye for that sort of thing .Thank you Ron !said Hermione looking both pleased and a little confused .Harry turned away smiling to himself .He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve FailSafe Ways to Charm Witches he caught Ginnys eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour .Out of the way out of the way !sang Mrs Weasley coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant beachballsized Snitch floating in front of her .Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake which Mrs Weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground .When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table Harry said That looks amazing Mrs Weasley .Oh its nothing dear she said fondly .Over her shoulder Ron gave Harry the thumbsup and mouthed Good one .By seven oclock all the guests had arrived led into the house by Fred and George who had waited for them at the end of the lane .Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best and horrible hairy brown suit .Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harrys hand Harry thought he looked rather unhappy .It was all very odd Tonks beside him looked simply radiant .Happy birthday Harry she said hugging him tightly .Seventeen eh !said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket sized glass of wine from Fred .Six years ter the day since we met Harry dyeh remember it ?Vaguely said Harry grinning up at him .Didnt you smash down the front door give Dudley a pigs tail and tell me I was a wizard ?I forge the details Hagrid chortled .All righ Ron Hermione ?Were fine said Hermione .How are you ?Ar not bad .Bin busy we got some newborn unicorns Ill show yeh when yeh get back Harry avoided Rons and Hermiones gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket .Here Harry couldn think what ter get yeh but then I remembered this .He pulled out a small slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string evidently intended to be worn around the neck .Mokeskin .Hide anythin in there an no one but the owner can get it out .Theyre rare them .Hagrid thanks !Snothin said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbinlid sized hand .An theres Charlie !Always liked him hey !Charlie !Charlie approached running his hand slightly ruefully over his new brutally short haircut .He was shorter than Ron thickset with a number of burns and scratches up his muscley arms .Hi Hagrid hows it going ?Bin meanin ter write fer ages .Hows Norbert doin ?Norbert ?Charlie laughed .The Norwegian Ridgeback ?We call her Norberta now .Wha Norberts a girl ?Oh yeah said Charlie .How can you tell ?asked Hermione .Theyre a lot more vicious said Charlie .He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice .Wish Dad would hurry up and get here .Mums getting edgy .They all looked over at Mrs Weasley .She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate .I think wed better start without Arthur she called to the garden at large after a moment or two .He must have been held up at oh !They all saw it at the same time a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr Weasleys voice .Minister of Magic coming with me .The Patronus dissolved into thin air leaving Fleurs family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished .We shouldnt be here said Lupin at once .Harry Im sorry Ill explain another time He seized Tonkss wrist and pulled her away they reached the fence climbed over it and vanished from sight .Mrs Weasley looked bewildered .The Minister but why ?I dont understand But there was no time to discuss the matter a second later Mr Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair .The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern lit table where everybody sat in silence watching them draw closer .As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met scraggy and grim .Sorry to intrude said Scrimgeour as he limped to a halt before the table .Especially as I can see that I am gatecrashing a party .His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake .Many happy returns .Thanks said Harry .I require a private word with you Scrimgeour went on .Also with Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger .Us ?said Ron sounding surprised .Why us ?I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private said Scrimgeour .Is there such a place ?he demanded of Mr Weasley .Yes of course said Mr Weasley who looked nervous .The er sitting room why dont you use that ?You can lead the way Scrimgeour said to Ron .There will be no need for you to accompany us Arthur .Harry saw Mr Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs Weasley as he Ron and Hermione stood up .As they led the way back to the house in silence Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was Scrimgeour must somehow have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts .Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into the Burrows sitting room .Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light it was already dark in here Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room .Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr Weasley normally occupied leaving Harry Ron and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa .Once they had done so Scrimgeour spoke .I have some questions for the three of you and I think it will be best if we do it individually .If you two he pointed at Harry and Hermione can wait upstairs I will start with Ronald .Were not going anywhere said Harry while Hermione nodded vigorously .You can speak to us together or not at all .Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold appraising look .Harry had the impression that the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early .Very well then together he said shrugging .He cleared his throat .I am here as Im sure you know because of Albus Dumbledores will .Harry Ron and Hermione looked at one another .A surprise apparently !You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything ?Aall of us ?said Ron .Me and Hermione too ?Yes all of But Harry interrupted .Dumbledore died over a month ago .Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us ?Isnt it obvious ?said Hermione before Scrimgeour could answer .They wanted to examine whatever hes left us .You had no right to do that !she said and her voice trembled slightly .I had every right said Scrimgeour dismissively .The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts said Hermione and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceaseds possessions are illegal before seizing them !Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed ?Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law Miss Granger ?asked Scrimgeour .No Im not retorted Hermione .Im hoping to do some good in the world !Ron laughed .Scrimgeour s eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke .So why have you decided to let us have our things now ?Cant think of a pretext to keep them ?No itll be because the thirtyone days are up said Hermione at once .They cant keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove theyre dangerous .Right ?Would you say you were close to Dumbledore Ronald ?asked Scrimgeour ignoring Hermione .Ron looked startled .Me ?Not not really .It was always Harry who .Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione to see Hermione giving him a stoptalkingnow sort of look but the damage was done Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected and wanted to hear .He swooped like a bird of prey upon Rons answer .If you were not very close to Dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will ?He made exceptionally few personal bequests .The vast majority of his possessions his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects were left to Hogwarts .Why do you think you were singled out ?I .dunno said Ron .I .when I say we werent close .I mean I think he liked me .Youre being modest Ron said Hermione .Dumbledore was very fond of you .This was stretching the truth to breaking point as far as Harry knew Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together and direct contact between them had been negligible .However Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening .He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry .From it he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud . ‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore .Yes here we are . ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley I leave my Deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it .Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had he knew the power to suck all light from a place and restore it with a simple click .Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron who took it and turned it over in his fingers looking stunned .That is a valuable object said Scrimgeour watching Ron .It may even be unique .Certainly it is of Dumbledores own design .Why would he have left you an item so rare ?Ron shook his head looking bewildered .Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students Scrimgeour persevered .Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three .Why is that ?To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator Mr Weasley ?Put out lights I spose mumbled Ron .What else could I do with it ?Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions .After squinting at Ron for a moment or two he turned back to Dumbledores will .To Miss Hermione Jean Granger I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive .Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs .Its binding was stained and peeling in places .Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word .She held the book in her lap and gazed at it .Harry saw that the title was in runes he had never learned to read them .As he looked a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols .Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book Miss Granger ?asked Scrimgeour .He .he knew I liked books said Hermione in a thick voice mopping her eyes with her sleeve .But why that particular book ?I dont know .He must have thought Id enjoy it .Did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with Dumbledore ?No I didnt said Hermione still wiping her eyes on her sleeve .And if the Ministry hasnt found any hidden codes in this book in thirtyone days I doubt that I will .She suppressed a sob .They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione s shoulders .Scrimgeour turned back to the will . ‘To Harry James Potter he read and Harrys insides contracted with a sudden excitement ‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill .As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny walnutsized golden ball its silver wings fluttered rather feebly and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax .Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch ?asked Scrimgeour .No idea said Harry .For the reasons you just read out I suppose .to remind me what you can get if you .persevere and whatever it was .You think this a mere symbolic keepsake then ?I suppose so said Harry .What else could it be ?Im asking the questions said Scrimgeour shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa .Dusk was really falling outside now the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge .I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch Scrimgeour said to Harry .Why is that ?Hermione laughed derisively .Oh it cant be a reference to the fact Harrys a great Seeker thats way too obvious she said .There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing !I dont think theres anything hidden in the icing said Scrimgeour but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object .You know why Im sure ?Harry shrugged .Hermione however answered Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge .Because Snitches have flesh memories she said .What ?said Harry and Ron together both considered Hermione s Quidditch knowledge negligible .Correct said Scrimgeour .A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves .It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture .This Snitch he held up the tiny golden ball will remember your touch Potter .It occurs to me that Dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you .Harrys heart was beating rather fast .He was sure that Scrimgeour was right .How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister ?You dont say anything said Scrimgeour .Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains ?No said Harry still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so .If only he knew Legilimency really knew it and could read Hermiones mind he could practically hear her brain whirring beside him .Take it said Scrimgeour quietly .Harry met the Ministers yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey .He held out his hand and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the Snitch slowly and deliberately into Harrys palm .Nothing happened .As Harrys fingers closed around the Snitch its tired wings fluttered and were still .Scrimgeour Ron and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball as if still hoping it might transform in some way .That was dramatic said Harry coolly .Both Ron and Hermione laughed .Thats all then is it ?asked Hermione making to prise herself off the sofa .Not quite said Scrimgeour who looked bad tempered now .Dumbledore left you a second bequest Potter .What is it ?asked Harry excitement rekindling .Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time .The sword of Godric Gryffindor he said .Hermione and Ron both stiffened .Harry looked around for a sign of the rubyencrusted hilt but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which in any case looked much too small to contain it .So where is it ?Harry asked suspiciously .Unfortunately said Scrimgeour that sword was not Dumbledore s to give away .The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact and as such belongs It belongs to Harry !said Hermione hotly .It chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the Sorting Hat According to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor said Scrimgeour .That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr Potter whatever Dumbledore may have decided .Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek scrutinizing Harry .Why do you think ?Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword ?said Harry struggling to keep his temper .Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall .This is not a joke Potter !growled Scrimgeour .Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin ?Did he wish to give you that sword Potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy HeWhoMustNotBeNamed ?Interesting theory said Harry .Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort ?Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban .So is this what youve been doing Minister shut up in your office trying to break open a Snitch ?People are dying I was nearly one of them Voldemort chased me across three counties he killed MadEye Moody but theres been no word about any of that from the Ministry has there ?And you still expect us to cooperate with you !You go too far !shouted Scrimgeour standing up Harry jumped to his feet too .Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand It singed a hole in Harrys T shirt like a lit cigarette .Oi !said Ron jumping up and raising his own wand but Harry said No !Dyou want to give him an excuse to arrest us ?Remembered youre not at school have you ?said Scrimgeour breathing hard into Harrys face .Remembered that I am not Dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination ?You may wear that scar like a crown Potter but it is not up to a seventeenyearold boy to tell me how to do my job !Its time you learned some respect !Its time you earned it said Harry .The floor trembled there was a sound of running footsteps then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr and Mrs Weasley ran in .We we thought we heard began Mr Weasley looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose .raised voices panted Mrs Weasley .Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry glancing at the hole he had made in Harrys Tshirt .He seemed to regret his loss of temper .It it was nothing he growled .I .regret your attitude he said looking Harry full in the face once more .You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you what Dumbledore desired .We ought to be working together .I dont like your methods Minister said Harry .Remember ?For the second time he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it spelling I must not tell lies .Scrimgeour s expression hardened .He turned away without another word and limped from the room .Mrs Weasley hurried after him Harry heard her stop at the back door .After a minute or so she called Hes gone !What did he want ?Mr Weasley asked looking around at Harry Ron and Hermione as Mrs Weasley came hurrying back to them .To give us what Dumbledore left us said Harry .Theyve only just released the contents of his will .Outside in the garden over the dinner tables the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand .Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch .As Mr Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time Mrs Weasley said tentatively Harry dear everyones awfully hungry we didnt like to start without you .Shall I serve dinner now ?They all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of Happy Birthday and much gulping of cake the party broke up .Hagrid who was invited to the wedding the following day but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field .Meet us upstairs Harry whispered to Hermione while they helped Mrs Weasley restore the garden to its normal state .After everyones gone to bed .Up in the attic room Ron examined his Deluminator and Harry filled Hagrids mokeskin purse not with gold but with those items he most prized apparently worthless though some of them were the Marauders Map the shard of Siriuss enchanted mirror and R .A .B .s locket .He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly .At last Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside .Muffliato she whispered waving her wand in the direction of the stairs .Thought you didnt approve of that spell ?said Ron .Times change said Hermione .Now show us that Deluminator .Ron obliged at once .Holding it up in front of him he clicked it .The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once .The thing is whispered Hermione through the dark we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder .There was a small click and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more .Still its cool said Ron a little defensively .And from what they said Dumbledore invented it himself !I know but surely he wouldnt have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights !Dyou think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything hed left us ?asked Harry .Definitely said Hermione .He couldnt tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that still doesnt explain . .why he couldnt have given us a hint when he was alive ?asked Ron .Well exactly said Hermione now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard .If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry youd think hed have let us know why .unless he thought it was obvious ?Thought wrong then didnt he ?said Ron .I always said he was mental .Brilliant and everything but cracked .Leaving Harry an old Snitch what the hell was that about ?Ive no idea said Hermione .When Scrimgeour made you take it Harry I was so sure that something was going to happen !Yeah well said Harry his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in his fingers .I wasnt going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour was I ?What do you mean ?asked Hermione .The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match ?said Harry .Dont you remember ?Hermione looked simply bemused .Ron however gasped pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice .That was the one you nearly swallowed !Exactly said Harry and with his heart beating fast he pressed his mouth to the Snitch .It did not open .Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him He lowered the golden sphere but then Hermione cried out .Writing !Theres writing on it quick look !He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement .Hermione was quite right .Engraved upon the smooth golden surface where seconds before there had been nothing were five words written in the thin slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledores I open at the close .He had barely read them when the words vanished again . ‘I open at the close .Whats that supposed to mean ?Hermione and Ron shook their heads looking blank .I open at the close .at the close .I open at the close .But no matter how often they repeated the words with many different inflections they were unable to wring any more meaning from them .And the sword said Ron finally when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitchs inscription .Why did he want Harry to have the sword ?And why couldnt he just have told me ?Harry said quietly .It was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year !If he wanted me to have it why didnt he just give it to me then ?He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him his brain slow and unresponsive .Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year ?Ought he to know what it all meant ?Had Dumbledore expected him to understand ?And as for this book said Hermione The Tales of Beedle the Bard .Ive never even heard of them !Youve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard ?said Ron incredulously .Youre kidding right ?No Im not !said Hermione in surprise .Do you know them then ?Well of course I do !Harry looked up diverted .The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented .Ron however looked bemused by their surprise .Oh come on !All the old kids stories are supposed to be Beedle s arent they ?The Fountain of Fair Fortune .The Wizard and the Hopping Pot . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump .Excuse me ?said Hermione giggling .What was that last one ?Come off it !said Ron looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione .You mustve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty Ron you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles !said Hermione .We didnt hear stories like that when we were little we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and ‘Cinderella Whats that an illness ?asked Ron .So these are childrens stories ?asked Hermione bending again over the runes .Yeah said Ron uncertainly I mean thats just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from Beedle .I dunno what theyre like in the original versions .But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them ?Something creaked downstairs .Probably just Charlie now Mums asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair said Ron nervously .All the same we should get to bed whispered Hermione .It wouldnt do to oversleep tomorrow .No agreed Ron .A brutal triple murder by the bridegrooms mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding .Ill get the lights .And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room .THE WEDDING Three oclock on the following afternoon found Harry Ron Fred and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests .Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village Ottery St .Catchpole from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm .The plan was to introduce Harry as Cousin Barny and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him .All four of them were clutching seating plans so that they could help show people to the right seats .A host of whiterobed waiters had arrived an hour earlier along with a goldenjacketed band and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot .Behind Harry the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet .The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers .Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife .Outside butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow .Harry was rather uncomfortable .The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summers day .When I get married said Fred tugging at the collar of his own robes I wont be bothering with any of this nonsense .You can all wear what you like and Ill put a full BodyBind Curse on Mum until its all over .She wasnt too bad this morning considering said George .Cried a bit about Percy not being here but who wants him ?Oh blimey brace yourselves here they come look .Brightly colored figures were appearing one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard .Within minutes a procession had formed which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee .Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches hats while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards cravats a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent .Excellent I think I see a few veela cousins said George craning his neck for a better look .Theyll need help understanding our English customs Ill look after them .Not so fast Your Holeyness said Fred and darting past the gaggle of middleaged witches heading the procession he said Here permettezmoi to assister vous to a pair of pretty French girls who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside .George was left to deal with the middleaged witches and Ron took charge of Mr Weasleys old Ministry colleague Perkins while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harrys lot .Wotcher said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue .She had turned blonde for the occasion .Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair .Sorry about last night she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle .The Ministrys being very antiwerewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors .Its fine I understand said Harry speaking more to Lupin than Tonks .Lupin gave him a swift smile but as they turned away Harry saw Lupins face fall again into lines of misery .He did not understand it but there was no time to dwell on the matter Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption .Having misunderstood Freds directions he had sat himself not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks .While Mr Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron facetoface with a most eccentriclooking wizard .Slightly cross eyed with shoulderlength white hair the texture of candyfloss he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eyewatering shade of eggyolk yellow .An odd symbol rather like a triangular eye glistened from a golden chain around his neck .Xenophilius Lovegood he said extending a hand to Harry my daughter and I live just over the hill so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us .But I think you know my Luna ?he added to Ron .Yes said Ron .Isnt she with you ?She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation !How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes or to give them their correct name the Gernumbli gardensi .Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words said Ron but I think Fred and George taught them those .He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up .Hello Harry !she said .Er my names Barny said Harry flummoxed .Oh have you changed that too ?she asked brightly .How did you know ?Oh just your expression she said .Like her father Luna was wearing bright yellow robes which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair .Once you got over the brightness of it all the general effect was quite pleasant .At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears .Xenophilius who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry .Bidding the wizard farewell he turned to his daughter who held up her finger and said Daddy look one of the gnomes actually bit me !How wonderful !Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial !said Mr Lovegood seizing Lunas outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks .Luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish do not repress it !You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies !Ron passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort .Ron can laugh said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic .Really ?said Harry who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her fathers peculiar views .Are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite though ?Oh its fine said Luna sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down .You look smart .I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know .As she drifted off after her father Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm .Her beaky nose redrimmed eyes and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a badtempered flamingo . .and your hairs much too long Ronald for a moment I thought you were Ginevra .Merlins beard what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing ?He looks like an omelet .And who are you ?she barked at Harry .Oh yeah Auntie Muriel this is our cousin Barny .Another Weasley ?You breed like gnomes .Isnt Harry Potter here ?I was hoping to meet him .I thought he was a friend of yours Ronald or have you merely been boasting ?No he couldnt come Hmm .Made an excuse did he ?Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then .Ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara she shouted at Harry .Goblinmade you know and been in my family for centuries .Shes a goodlooking girl but still French .Well well find me a good seat Ronald I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long .Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time When next they met at the entrance Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places .The marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside .Nightmare Muriel is said Ron mopping his forehead on his sleeve .She used to come for Christmas every year then thank God she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner .Dad always says shell have written them out of her will like they care theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate theyre going .Wow he added blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them .You look great !Always the tone of surprise said Hermione though she smiled .She was wearing a floaty lilaccolored dress with matching high heels her hair was sleek and shiny .Your GreatAunt Muriel doesnt agree I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara .She said ‘Oh dear is this the Muggleborn ?and then ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles .Dont take it personally shes rude to everyone said Ron .Talking about Muriel ?inquired George reemerging from the marquee with Fred .Yeah shes just told me my ears are lopsided .Old bat .I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings .Wasnt he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty four hours later ?asked Hermione .Well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end conceded George .But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party said Fred .He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his Yes he sounds a real charmer said Hermione while Harry roared with laughter .Never married for some reason said Ron .You amaze me said Hermione .They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer a darkhaired young man with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows until he held out his invitation to Ron and said with his eyes on Hermione You look vunderful .Viktor !she shrieked and dropped her small beaded bag which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size .As she scrambled blushing to pick it up she said I didnt know you were goodness its lovely to see how are you ?Rons ears had turned bright red again .After glancing at Krums invitation as if he did not believe a word of it he said much too loudly How come youre here ?Fleur invited me said Krum eyebrows raised .Harry who had no grudge against Krum shook hands then feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Rons vicinity offered to show him his seat .Your friend is not pleased to see me said Krum as they entered the now packed marquee .Or is he a relative ?he added with a glance at Harrys red curly hair .Cousin Harry muttered but Krum was not really listening .His appearance was causing a stir particularly amongst the veela cousins He was after all a famous Quidditch player .While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him Ron Hermione Fred and George came hurrying down the aisle .Time to sit down Fred told Harry or were going to get run over by the bride .Harry Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George .Hermione looked rather pink and Rons ears were still scarlet .After a few moments he muttered to Harry Did you see hes grown a stupid little beard ?Harry gave a noncommittal grunt .A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter .Mr and Mrs Weasley strolled up the aisle smiling and waving at relatives Mrs Weasley was wearing a brandnew set of amethystcolored robes with a matching hat .A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee both wearing dress robes with large white roses in their buttonholes Fred wolfwhistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins .Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons .Ooooh !said Hermione swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance .A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle Fleur gliding Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming .Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong silvery glow .While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison today it beautified everybody it fell upon .Ginny and Gabrielle both wearing golden dresses looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur had reached him Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback .Ladies and gentlemen said a slightly singsong voice and with a slight shock Harry saw the same small tuftyhaired wizard who had presided at Dumbledores funeral now standing in front of Bill and Fleur .We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls .Yes my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper .But I must say Ginevras dress is far too low cut .Ginny glanced around grinning winked at Harry then quickly faced the front again .Harrys mind wandered a long way from the marquee back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds .They seemed so long ago they had always seemed too good to be true as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal persons life a person without a lightningshaped scar on his forehead .Do you William Arthur take Fleur Isabelle . ?In the front row Mrs Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace .Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tableclothsized handkerchiefs .Hermione turned and beamed at Harry her eyes too were full of tears . .then I declare you bonded for life .The tuftyhaired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them spiraling around their now entwined figures .As Fred and George led a round of applause the golden balloons overhead burst Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them adding their songs and chimes to the din .Ladies and gentlemen !called the tuftyhaired wizard .If you would please stand up !They all did so Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly he waved his wand again .The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside .Next a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small whiteclothed tables which all floated gracefully back to earth around it and the golden jacketed band trooped toward a podium .Smooth said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice butterbeer and firewhisky others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches .We should go and congratulate them !said Hermione standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well wishers .Well have time later shrugged Ron snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry .Hermione cop hold lets grab a table .Not there !Nowhere near Muriel Ron led the way across the empty dance floor glancing left and right as he went Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum .By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee most of the tables were occupied The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone .All right if we join you ?asked Ron .Oh yes she said happily .Daddys just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present .What is it a lifetimes supply of Gurdyroots ?asked Ron .Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table but caught Harry instead .Eyes watering in pain Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments .The band had begun to play .Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first to great applause after a while Mr Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor followed by Mrs Weasley and Fleurs father .I like this song said Luna swaying in time to the waltzlike tune and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor where she revolved on the spot quite alone eyes closed and waving her arms .Shes great isnt she ?said Ron admiringly .Always good value .But the smile vanished from his face at once Viktor Krum had dropped into Lunas vacant seat .Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not come to compliment her .With a scowl on his face he said Who is that man in the yellow ?Thats Xenophilius Lovegood hes the father of a friend of ours said Ron .His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius despite the clear provocation .Come and dance he added abruptly to Hermione .She looked taken aback but pleased too and got up .They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor .Ah they are together now ?asked Krum momentarily distracted .Er sort of said Harry .Who are you ?Krum asked .Barny Weasley .They shook hands .You Barny you know this man Lovegood veil ?No I only met him today .Why ?Krum glowered over the top of his drink watching Xenophilius who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor .Because said Krum if he vos not a guest of Fleurs I vould duel him here and now for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest .Sign ?said Harry looking over at Xenophilius too .The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest .Why ?Whats wrong with it ?Grindelvald .That is Grindelvalds sign .Grindelwald .the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated ?Exactly .Krums jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing then he said Grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance .Of course he vos never poverful in this country they said he feared Dumbledore and rightly seeing how he vos finished .But this he pointed a finger at Xenophilius this is his symbol I recognized it at vunce Grindelvald carved it into a vail at Durmstrang ven he vos a pupil there .Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better .Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius .Harry felt perplexed .It seemed incredibly unlikely that Lunas father was a supporter of the Dark Arts and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular runelike shape .Are you er quite sure its Grindelwalds ?I am not mistaken said Krum coldly .I valked past that sign for several years I know it veil .Well theres a chance said Harry that Xenophilius doesnt actually know what the symbol means .The Lovegoods are quite .unusual .He could easily have picked it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a CrumpleHorned Snorkack or something .The cross section of a vot ?Well I dont know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them .Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father .Thats her he said pointing at Luna who was still dancing alone waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges .Vy is she doing that ?asked Krum .Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt said Harry who recognized the symptoms .Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him .He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh sparks flew out of the end .Gregorovitch !said Harry loudly and Krum started but Harry was too excited to care the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krums wand Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament .Vot about him ?asked Krum suspiciously .Hes a wandmaker !I know that said Krum .He made your wand !Thats why I thought Quidditch Krum was looking more and more suspicious .How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand ?I .I read it somewhere I think said Harry .In a a fan magazine he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified .I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans he said .So .er .where is Gregorovitch these days ?Krum looked puzzled .He retired several years ago .I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand .They are the best although I know of course that you Britons set much store by Ollivander .Harry did not answer .He pretended to watch the dancers like Krum but he was thinking hard .So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not have to search far for a reason It was surely because of what Harrys wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies .The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand something that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood .Would Gregorovitch know better ?Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not ?This girl is very nicelooking Krum said recalling Harry to his surroundings .Krum was pointing at Ginny who had just joined Luna .She is also a relative of yours ?Yeah said Harry suddenly irritated and shes seeing someone .Jealous type .Big bloke .You wouldnt want to cross him .Krum grunted .Vot he said draining his goblet and getting to his feet again is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the goodlooking girls are taken ?And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor .He wanted to find Ron to tell him about Gregorovitch but Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor .Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny who was now dancing with Fred and Georges friend Lee Jordan trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron .He had never been to a wedding before so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd .As evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy now lit with floating golden lanterns the revelry became more and more uncontained .Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleurs cousins Charlie Hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing Odo the Hero in a corner .Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Rons who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table .His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a motheaten fez .He was vaguely familiar Racking his brains Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledores obituary .Harry approached him .May I sit down ?Of course of course said Doge he had a rather highpitched wheezy voice .Harry leaned in .Mr Doge Im Harry Potter .Doge gasped .My dear boy !Arthur told me you were here disguised .I am so glad so honored !In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne .I thought of writing to you he whispered after Dumbledore .the shock .and for you I am sure Doges tiny eyes filled with sudden tears .I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet said Harry .I didnt realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well .As well as anyone said Doge dabbing his eyes with a napkin .Certainly I knew him longest if you dont count Aberforth and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth .Speaking of the Daily Prophet .I dont know whether you saw Mr Doge ?Oh please call me Elphias dear boy .Elphias I dont know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore ?Doges face flooded with angry color .Oh yes Harry I saw it .That woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her .I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you may have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity .Well in that interview Harry went on Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young .Dont believe a word of it !said Doge at once .Not a word Harry !Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore !Harry looked into Doges earnest pained face and felt not reassured but frustrated .Did Doge really think it was that easy that Harry could simply choose not to believe ?Didnt Doge understand Harrys need to be sure to know everything ?Perhaps Doge suspected Harrys feelings for he looked concerned and hurried on Harry Rita Skeeter is a dreadful But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle .Rita Skeeter ?Oh I love her always read her !Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there the plumes dancing on her hat a goblet of champagne in her hand .Shes written a book about Dumbledore you know !Hello Muriel said Doge .Yes we were just discussing You there !Give me your chair Im a hundred and seven !Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat looking alarmed and Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and Harry .Hello again Barry or whatever your name is she said to Harry .Now what were you saying about Rita Skeeter Elphias ?You know shes written a biography of Dumbledore ?I cant wait to read it I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts !Doge looked stiff and solemn at this but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement .She took another large gulp of champagne belched and then said Theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs !Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus !Illinformed sniping said Doge turning radish colored again .You would say that Elphias cackled Auntie Muriel .I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours !Im sorry you think so said Doge more coldly still .I assure you I was writing from the heart .Oh we all know you worshipped Dumbledore I daresay youll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister !Muriell exclaimed Doge .A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harrys chest .What do you mean ?he asked Muriel .Who said his sister was a Squib ?I thought she was ill ?Thought wrong then didnt you Barry !said Auntie Muriel looking delighted at the effect she had produced .Anyway how could you expect to know anything about it ?It all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened .Thats why I cant wait to find out what Skeeters unearthed !Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time !Untrue !wheezed Doge .Absolutely untrue !He never told me his sister was a Squib said Harry without thinking still cold inside .And why on earth would he tell you ?screeched Muriel swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry .The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion is I should have thought quite clear .He was so devastated by her death Why did nobody ever see her Elphias ?squawked Muriel .Why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her ?Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar ?Off being brilliant at Hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house !What dyou mean locked in the cellar ?asked Harry .What is this ?Doge looked wretched .Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry .Dumbledores mother was a terrifying woman simply terrifying .Muggleborn though I heard she pretended otherwise She never pretended anything of the sort !Kendra was a fine woman whispered Doge miserably but Auntie Muriel ignored him .proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib Ariana was not a Squib !wheezed Doge .So you say Elphias but explain then why she never attended Hogwarts !said Auntie Muriel .She turned back to Harry .In our day Squibs were often hushed up though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didnt exist I tell you thats not what happened !said Doge but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on still addressing Harry .Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community .much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world where they must always be second class but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldnt have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school Ariana was delicate !said Doge desperately .Her health was always too poor to permit her to permit her to leave the house ?cackled Muriel .And yet she was never taken to St .Mungos and no Healer was ever summoned to see her !Really Muriel how you can possibly know whether For your information Elphias my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St .Mungos at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there .All most suspicious Lancelot thought !Doge looked to be on the verge of tears .Auntie Muriel who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely snapped her fingers for more champagne .Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up locked him away kept him out of sight all for the crime of being a wizard .Had Dumbledores sister suffered the same fate in reverse imprisoned for her lack of magic ?And had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented ?Now if Kendra hadnt died first Muriel resumed Id have said that it was she who finished off Ariana How can you Muriel ?groaned Doge .A mother kill her own daughter ?Think what you are saying !If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not ?shrugged Auntie Muriel .But as I say it doesnt fit because Kendra died before Ariana of what nobody ever seemed sure Oh no doubt Ariana murdered her said Doge with a brave attempt at scorn .Why not ?Yes Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully .Shake your head all you like Elphias !You were at Arianas funeral were you not ?Yes I was said Doge through trembling lips .And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember .Albus was heartbroken His heart wasnt the only thing .Didnt Aberforth break Albus s nose halfway through the service ?If Doge had looked horrified before this it was nothing to how he looked now .Muriel might have stabbed him .She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne which dribbled down her chin .How do you ?croaked Doge .My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot said Auntie Muriel happily .Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door .A coffinside brawl !The way Bathilda told it Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus s fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face .According to Bathilda Albus did not even defend himself and thats odd enough in itself Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back .Muriel swigged yet more champagne .The recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge .Harry did not know what to think what to believe He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill .Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story .And Ill tell you something else Muriel said hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet .I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter .All those hints in Skeeters interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business and it would fit !Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter !whispered Doge .Bathilda Bagshot ?Harry said .The author of A History of Magic ?The name was printed on the front of one of Harrys textbooks though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively .Yes said Doge clutching at Harrys question like a drowning man at a life belt .A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albuss .Quite gaga these days Ive heard said Auntie Muriel cheerfully .If that is so it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her said Doge and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said !Oh there are ways of bringing back memories and Im sure Rita Skeeter knows them all said Auntie Muriel .But even if Bathildas completely cuckoo Im sure shed still have old photographs maybe even letters .She knew the Dumbledores for years .Well worth a trip to Godrics Hollow Id have thought .Harry who had been taking a sip of butterbeer choked .Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes .Once he had control of his voice again he asked Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godrics Hollow ?Oh yes shes been there forever !The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor .The Dumbledores lived in Godrics Hollow ?Yes Barry thats what I just said said Auntie Muriel testily .Harry felt drained empty .Never once in six years had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godrics Hollow .Why ?Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore s mother and sister ?Had Dumbledore visited their graves perhaps walked past Lilys and Jamess to do so ?And he had never once told Harry .never bothered to say And why it was so important Harry could not explain even to himself yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common .He stared ahead of him barely noticing what was going on around him and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him .I simply cant dance anymore she panted slipping off one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot .Rons gone looking to find more butterbeers .Its a bit odd Ive just seen Viktor storming away from Lunas father it looked like theyd been arguing She dropped her voice staring at him .Harry are you okay ?Harry did not know where to begin but it did not matter .At that moment something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor .Graceful and gleaming the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers .Heads turned as those nearest it froze absurdly in middance .Then the Patronuss mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud deep slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt .The Ministry has fallen .Scrimgeour is dead .They are coming .9 A PLACE TO HIDE Everything seemed fuzzy slow .Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands .Many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished .Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed .Then somebody screamed .Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd .Guests were sprinting in all directions many were Disapparating the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken .Ron !Hermione cried .Ron where are you ?As they pushed their way across the dance floor Harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd then he saw Lupin and Tonks their wands raised and heard both of them shout Protego a cry that was echoed on all sides Ron !Ron !Hermione called half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests Harry seized her hand to make sure they werent separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know And then Ron was there .He caught hold of Hermione s free arm and Harry felt her turn on the spot sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him all he could feel was Hermiones hand as he was squeezed through space and time away from the Burrow away from the descending Death Eaters away perhaps from Voldemort himself .Where are we ?said Rons voice .Harry opened his eyes .For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all They still seemed to be surrounded by people .Tottenham Court Road panted Hermione .Walk just walk we need to find somewhere for you to change .Harry did as she asked .They half walked half ran up the wide dark street thronged with latenight revelers and lined with closed shops stars twinkling above them .A doubledecker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pubgoers ogled them as they passed Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes .Hermione we havent got anything to change into Ron told her as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him .Why didnt I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me ?said Harry inwardly cursing his own stupidity .All last year I kept it on me and Its okay Ive got the Cloak Ive got clothes for both of you said Hermione .Just try and act naturally until this will do .She led them down a side street then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway .When you say youve got the Cloak and clothes .said Harry frowning at Hermione who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag in which she was now rummaging .Yes theyre here said Hermione and to Harry and Rons utter astonishment she pulled out a pair of jeans a sweatshirt some maroon socks and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak .How the ruddy hell ?Undetectable Extension Charm said Hermione .Tricky but I think Ive done it okay anyway I managed to fit everything we need in here .She gave the fragilelooking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it .Oh damn thatll be the books she said peering into it and I had them all stacked by subject .Oh well .Harry youd better take the Invisibility Cloak .Ron hurry up and change .When did you do all this ?Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes .I told you at the Burrow Ive had the essentials packed for days you know in case we needed to make a quick getaway .I packed your rucksack this morning Harry after you changed and put it in here . .I just had a feeling .Youre amazing you are said Ron handing her his bundledup robes .Thank you said Hermione managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag .Please Harry get that Cloak on !Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head vanishing from sight .He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened .The others everyone at the wedding We cant worry about that now whispered Hermione .Its you theyre after Harry and well just put everyone in even more danger by going back .Shes right said Ron who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue even if he could not see his face .Most of the Order was there theyll look after everyone .Harry nodded then remembered that they could not see him and said Yeah .But he thought of Ginny and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach .Come on I think we ought to keep moving said Hermione .They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement .Just as a matter of interest why Tottenham Court Road ?Ron asked Hermione .Ive no idea it just popped into my head but Im sure were safer out in the Muggle world its not where theyll expect us to be .True said Ron looking around but dont you feel a bit exposed ?Where else is there ?asked Hermione cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf whistling at her .We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron can we ?And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there .I suppose we could try my parents house though I think theres a chance they might check there .Oh I wish theyd shut up !All right darling ?the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling .Fancy a drink ?Ditch ginger and come and have a pint !Lets sit down somewhere Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road .Look this will do in here !It was a small and shabby allnight cafe .A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica topped tables but it was at least empty .Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione who had her back to the entrance and did not like it She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch .Harry did not like being stationary walking had given the illusion that they had a goal .Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him his hands returning to their usual length and shape .He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again .After a minute or two Ron said You know were not far from the Leaky Cauldron here its only in Charing Cross Ron we cant !said Hermione at once .Not to stay there but to find out whats going on !We know whats going on !Voldemorts taken over the Ministry what else do we need to know ?Okay okay it was just an idea !They relapsed into a prickly silence .The gumchewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos As Harry was invisible it would have looked odd to order him one .A pair of burly workmen entered the cafe and squeezed into the next booth .Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper .I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside .Once were there we could send a message to the Order .Can you do that talking Patronus thing then ?asked Ron .Ive been practicing and I think so said Hermione .Well as long as it doesnt get them into trouble though they mightve been arrested already .God thats revolting Ron added after one sip of the foamy grayish coffee .The waitress had heard she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers orders .The larger of the two workmen who was blond and quite huge now that Harry came to look at him waved her away .She stared affronted .Lets get going then I dont want to drink this muck said Ron .Hermione have you got Muggle money to pay for this ?Yes I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow .Ill bet all the change is at the bottom sighed Hermione reaching for her beaded bag .The two workmen made identical movements and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought All three of them drew their wands .Ron a few seconds late in realizing what was going on lunged across the table pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench .The force of the Death Eaters spells shattered the tiled wall where Rons head had just been as Harry still invisible yelled Stupefyl The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light He slumped sideways unconscious .His companion unable to see who had cast the spell fired another at Ron Shining black ropes flew from his wandtip and bound Ron head to foot the waitress screamed and ran for the door Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron but the spell missed rebounded on the window and hit the waitress who collapsed in front of the door .Expulsol bellowed the Death Eater and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him .Petrificus TotalusV screamed Hermione from out of sight and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee .Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over .Ddiffindo she said pointing her wand at Ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut .Oh Im so sorry Ron my hands shaking !Diffindol The severed ropes fell away .Ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them .Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench .I shouldve recognized him he was there the night Dumbledore died he said .He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot the mans eyes moved rapidly between Harry Ron and Hermione .Thats Dolohov said Ron .I recognize him from the old wanted posters .I think the big ones Thorfinn Rowle .Never mind what theyre called !said Hermione a little hysterically .How did they find us ?What are we going to do ?Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harrys head .Lock the door he told her and Ron turn out the lights .He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the cafe into darkness .Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier yelling at another girl in the distance .What are we going to do with them ?Ron whispered to Harry through the dark then even more quietly Kill them ?Theyd kill us .They had a good go just now .Hermione shuddered and took a step backward .Harry shook his head .We just need to wipe their memories said Harry .Its better like that itll throw them off the scent .If we killed them itd be obvious we were here .Youre the boss said Ron sounding profoundly relieved .But Ive never done a Memory Charm .Nor have I said Hermione but I know the theory .She took a deep calming breath then pointed her wand at Dolohovs forehead and said Obliviate .At once Dolohovs eyes became unfocused and dreamy .Brilliant !said Harry clapping her on the back .Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up .Clear up ?said Ron looking around at the partly destroyed cafe .Why ?Dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed ?Oh right yeah .Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket .Its no wonder I cant get it out Hermione you packed my old jeans theyre tight .Oh Im so sorry hissed Hermione and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead .Once the cafe was restored to its previous condition they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other .But how did they find us ?Hermione asked looking from one inert man to the other .How did they know where we were ?She turned to Harry .You you dont think youve still got your Trace on you do you Harry ?He cant have said Ron .The Trace breaks at seventeen thats Wizarding law you cant put it on an adult .As far as you know said Hermione .What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeenyearold ?But Harry hasnt been near a Death Eater in the last twentyfour hours .Whos supposed to have put a Trace back on him ?Hermione did not reply .Harry felt contaminated tainted Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them ?If I cant use magic and you cant use magic near me without us giving away our position he began .Were not splitting up !said Hermione firmly .We need a safe place to hide said Ron .Give us time to think things through .Grimmauld Place said Harry .The other two gaped .Dont be silly Harry Snape can get in there !Rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him and even if they havent worked he pressed on as Hermione began to argue so what ?I swear Id like nothing better than to meet Snape !But Hermione where else is there ?Its the best chance weve got .Snapes only one Death Eater .If Ive still got the Trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go .She could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to .While she unlocked the cafe door Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the cafes light .Then on Harrys count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily Harry Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more .Seconds later Harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square .Tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side .Number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore its Secret Keeper and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed .They raced up the stone steps and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand .They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold .As Harry closed the door behind them the old fashioned gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway .It looked just as Harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the houseelf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase .Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Siriuss mother .The only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again .I think somebodys been in here Hermione whispered pointing toward it .That couldve happened as the Order left Ron murmured back .So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape ?Harry asked .Maybe theyre only activated if he shows up ?suggested Ron .Yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house .Well we cant stay here forever said Harry and he took a step forward .Severus Snape ?MadEye Moodys voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright .Were not Snape !croaked Harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak .Before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again .The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation .Ron was making retching noises Hermione stammered That mmust have b been the TTongueTying Curse MadEye set up for Snape !Gingerly Harry took another step forward .Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall dustcolored and terrible Hermione screamed and so did Mrs Black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its waistlength hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets Horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at Harry .No !Harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him .No !It wasnt us !We didnt kill you On the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust Coughing his eyes watering Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and Ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying Its all rright .Its ggone .Dust swirled around Harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as Mrs Black continued to scream .Mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers SHUT UP !Harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her .That .that was .Hermione whimpered as Ron helped her to her feet .Yeah said Harry but it wasnt really him was it ?Just something to scare Snape .Had it worked Harry wondered or had Snape already blasted the horrorfigure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore ?Nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall halfexpecting some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board .Before we go any farther I think wed better check whispered Hermione and she raised her wand and said Homenum revelio .Nothing happened .Well youve just had a big shock said Ron kindly .What was that supposed to do ?It did what I meant it to do !said Hermione rather crossly .That was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us !And old Dusty said Ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpsefigure had risen .Lets go up said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor .Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her .Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch .Cant see anyone out there he reported .And youd think if Harry still had a Trace on him theyd have followed us here .I know they cant get in the house but whats up Harry ?Harry had given a cry of pain His scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water .He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock .What did you see ?Ron asked advancing on Harry .Did you see him at my place ?No I just felt anger hes really angry But that could be at the Burrow said Ron loudly .What else ?Didnt you see anything ?Was he cursing someone ?No I just felt anger I couldnt tell Harry felt badgered confused and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice Your scar again ?But whats going on ?I thought that connection had closed !It did for a while muttered Harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate .I I think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to But then youve got to close your mind !said Hermione shrilly .Harry Dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use Occlumency !Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember Yeah I do remember thanks said Harry through gritted teeth he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in Siriuss death .He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made Voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it It was like resisting the urge to be sick .He turned his back on Ron and Hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall .Then Hermione shrieked Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Rons father .Family safe do not reply we are being watched .The Patronus dissolved into nothingness .Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa Hermione joined him gripping his arm .Theyre all right theyre all right !she whispered and Ron half laughed and hugged her .Harry he said over Hermiones shoulder I Its not a problem said Harry sickened by the pain in his head .Its your family course youre worried .Id feel the same way .He thought of Ginny .I do feel the same way .The pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had done in the garden of the Burrow .Faintly he heard Hermione say I dont want to be on my own .Could we use the sleeping bags Ive brought and camp in here tonight ?He heard Ron agree .He could not fight the pain much longer He had to succumb .Bathroom he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running .He barely made it Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the great blond Death Eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while Harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice .More Rowle or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini ?Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time .You called me back for this to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again ?Draco give Rowle another taste of our displeasure .Do it or feel my wrath yourself !A log fell in the fire Flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face with a sense of emerging from deep water Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes .He was spreadeagled on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub .He sat up .Malfoys gaunt petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes .Harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort .There was a sharp rap on the door and Harry jumped as Hermiones voice rang out .Harry do you want your toothbrush ?Ive got it here .Yeah great thanks he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in .10 KREACHERS TALE Harry woke early next morning wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor .A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains It was the cool clear blue of watered ink somewhere between night and dawn and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermiones slow deep breathing .Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him .Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa so that her silhouette was raised above his .Her arm curved to the floor her fingers inches from Rons .Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands .The idea made him feel strangely lonely .He looked up at the shadowy ceiling the cobwebbed chandelier .Less than twentyfour hours ago he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee waiting to show in wedding guests .It seemed a lifetime away .What was going to happen now ?He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes of the daunting complex mission Dumbledore had left him .Dumbledore .The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledores death felt different now .The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized .Could Dumbledore have let such things happen ?Had he been like Dudley content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him ?Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden ?Harry thought of Godrics Hollow of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledores will and resentment swelled in the darkness .Why hadnt Dumbledore told him ?Why hadnt he explained ?Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all ?Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed but not trusted never confided in ?Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company .Desperate for something to do for distraction he slipped out of his sleeping bag picked up his wand and crept out of the room .On the landing he whispered Lumos and started to climb the stairs by wandlight .On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here he glanced into it .The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back .Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs .Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left .Snape ?Or perhaps Mundungus who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died ?Harrys gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black Siriuss greatgreatgrandfather but it was empty showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop .Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmasters study at Hogwarts .Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors .The one facing him bore a nameplate reading SIRIUS .Harry had never entered his godfathers bedroom before .He pushed open the door holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible .The room was spacious and must once have been handsome .There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs still resting in its sockets solid wax hanging in frostlike drips .A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the beds headboard a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe and as Harry moved deeper into the room he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice .The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls silverygray silk was visible .Harry could only assume that Siriuss parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest sons taste in decoration .Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents .There were several large Gryffindor banners faded scarlet and gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family .There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles and also Harry had to admire Siriuss nerve several posters of bikiniclad Muggle girls Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper .This was in contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm laughing at the camera .With a leap of pleasure Harry recognized his father his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harrys and he too wore glasses .Beside him was Sirius carelessly handsome his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive .To Siriuss right stood Pettigrew more than a head shorter plump and wateryeyed flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs with the muchadmired rebels that James and Sirius had been .On Jamess left was Lupin even then a little shabbylooking but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included .or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been that he saw these things in the picture ?He tried to take it from the wall it was his now after all Sirius had left him everything but it would not budge .Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room .Harry looked around at the floor .The sky outside was growing brighter A shaft of light revealed bits of paper books and small objects scattered over the carpet .Evidently Siriuss bedroom had been searched too although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly if not entirely worthless .A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers and sundry pages littered the floor .Harry bent down picked up a few of the pieces of paper and examined them .He recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual .The third was handwritten and crumpled .He smoothed it out .Dear Padfoot Thank you thank you for Harrys birthday present !It was his favorite by far .One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick he looked so pleased with himself Im enclosing a picture so you can see .You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas no complaints there .Of course James thought it was so funny says hes going to be a great Quidditch player but weve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we dont take our eyes off him when he gets going .We had a very quiet birthday tea just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry .We were so sorry you couldnt come but the Orders got to come first and Harrys not old enough to know its his birthday anyway !James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here he tries not to show it but I can tell also Dumbledores still got his Invisibility Cloak so no chance of little excursions .If you could visit it would cheer him up so much .Wormy was here last weekend I thought he seemed down but that was probably the news about the McKinnons I cried all evening when I heard .Bathilda drops in most days shes a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore Im not sure hed be pleased if he knew !I dont know how much to believe actually because it seems incredible that Dumbledore Harrys extremities seemed to have gone numb .He stood quite still holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal measure through his veins .Lurching to the bed he sat down .He read the letter again but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself .She had made her gs the same way he did He searched through the letter for every one of them and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil .The letter was an incredible treasure proof that Lily Potter had lived really lived that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment tracing ink into these letters these words words about him Harry her son .Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes he reread the letter this time concentrating on the meaning .It was like listening to a halfremembered voice .They had had a cat .perhaps it had perished like his parents at Godrics Hollow .or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it .Sirius had bought him his first broomstick .His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot had Dumbledore introduced them ?DumblecLores still got his Invisibility Cloak .There was something funny there .Harry paused pondering his mothers words .Why had Dumbledore taken Jamess Invisibility Cloak ?Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before I dont need a cloak to become invisible .Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance and Dumbledore had acted as carrier ?Harry passed on .Wormy was here .Pettigrew the traitor had seemed down had he ?Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time ?And finally Bathilda again who told incredible stories about Dumbledore .It seems incredible that Dumbledore That Dumbledore what ?But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test for instance or had taken up goatcharming like Aberforth .Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere .He seized papers treating them in his eagerness with as little consideration as the original searcher he pulled open drawers shook out books stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe and crawled under the bed and armchair .At last lying facedown on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers .When he pulled it out it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in her letter .A blackhaired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom roaring with laughter and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him .Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lilys letter and continued to look for the second sheet .After another quarter of an hour however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mothers letter was gone .Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room ?Harry read the first sheet again this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable .His toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters .The only potentially useful thing he could see here was possible information on Dumbledore .It seems incredible that Dumbledore what ?Harry ?Harry !HarryV Im here !he called .Whats happened ?There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door and Hermione burst inside .We woke up and didnt know where you were !she said breathlessly .She turned and shouted over her shoulder Ron !Ive found him !Rons annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below .Good !Tell him from me hes a git !Harry dont just disappear please we were terrified !Why did you come up here anyway ?She gazed around the ransacked room .What have you been doing ?Look what Ive just found .He held out his mothers letter .Hermione took it and read it while Harry watched her .When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him .Oh Harry .And theres this too .He handed her the torn photograph and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom .Ive been looking for the rest of the letter Harry said but its not here .Hermione glanced around .Did you make all this mess or was some of it done when you got here ?Someone had searched before me said Harry .I thought so .Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed .What were they after do you think ?Information on the Order if it was Snape .But youd think hed already have all he needed I mean he was in the Order wasnt he ?Well then said Harry keen to discuss his theory what about information on Dumbledore ?The second page of this letter for instance .You know this Bathilda my mum mentions you know who she is ?Who ?Bathilda Bagshot the author of A History of Magic said Hermione looking interested .So your parents knew her ?She was an incredible magical historian .And shes still alive said Harry and she lives in Godrics Hollow Rons Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding .She knew Dumbledore s family too .Be pretty interesting to talk to wouldnt she ?There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harrys liking .He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck so as not to have to look at her and give himself away .I understand why youd love to talk to her about your mum and dad and Dumbledore too said Hermione .But that wouldnt really help us in our search for the Horcruxes would it ?Harry did not answer and she rushed on Harry I know you really want to go to Godrics Hollow but Im scared Im scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday .It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried Im sure theyd be expecting you to visit it .Its not just that Harry said still avoiding looking at her .Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding .I want to know the truth .He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him .When he had finished Hermione said Of course I can see why thats upset you Harry Im not upset he lied Id just like to know whether or not its true or Harry do you really think youll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel or from Rita Skeeter ?How can you believe them ?You knew Dumbledore !I thought I did he muttered .But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you !Doge is right how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore ?He looked away trying not to betray the resentment he felt .There it was again Choose what to believe .He wanted the truth .Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it ?Shall we go down to the kitchen ?Hermione suggested after a little pause .Find something for breakfast ?He agreed but grudgingly and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that led off it .There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark .He paused at the top of the stairs to read it .It was a pompous little sign neatly lettered by hand the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door Do Not Enter Without the Express Permission of Regulus Arcturus Black Excitement trickled through Harry but he was not immediately sure why .He read the sign again .Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him .Hermione he said and he was surprised that his voice was so calm .Come back up here .Whats the matter ?R .A .B .I think Ive found him .There was a gasp and then Hermione ran back up the stairs .In your mums letter ?But I didnt see Harry shook his head pointing at Reguluss sign .She read it then clutched Harrys arm so tightly that he winced .Siriuss brother ?she whispered .He was a Death Eater said Harry Sirius told me about him he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave so they killed him .That fits !gasped Hermione .If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort and if he became disenchanted then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down !She released Harry leaned over the banister and screamed Ron !RON !Get up here quick !Ron appeared panting a minute later his wand ready in his hand .Whats up ?If its massive spiders again I want breakfast before I He frowned at the sign on Reguluss door to which Hermione was silently pointing .What ?That was Siriuss brother wasnt it ?Regulus Arcturus .Regulus .R .A .B .l The locket you dont reckon ?Lets find out said Harry .He pushed the door It was locked .Hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said Alohomora .There was a click and the door swung open .They moved over the threshold together gazing around .Reguluss bedroom was slightly smaller than Siriuss though it had the same sense of former grandeur .Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite .The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere draping the bed the walls and the windows .The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed along with its motto TOU JOURS PUR .Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings all stuck together to make a ragged collage .Hermione crossed the room to examine them .Theyre all about Voldemort she said .Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters .A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings .Harry meanwhile had noticed another photograph a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame .He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests Slytherins .Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother though he was smaller slighter and rather less handsome than Sirius had been .He played Seeker said Harry .What ?said Hermione vaguely she was still immersed in Voldemorts press clippings .Hes sitting in the middle of the front row thats where the Seeker .Never mind said Harry realizing that nobody was listening Ron was on his hands and knees searching under the wardrobe .Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk .Yet again somebody had searched before them .The drawers contents had been turned over recently the dust disturbed but there was nothing of value there old quills outof date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled a recently smashed ink bottle its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer .Theres an easier way said Hermione as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans .She raised her wand and said Accio Locked .Nothing happened .Ron who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains looked disappointed .Is that it then ?Its not here ?Oh it could still be here but under counter enchantments said Hermione .Charms to prevent it being summoned magically you know .Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave said Harry remembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket .How are we supposed to find it then ?asked Ron .We search manually said Hermione .Thats a good idea said Ron rolling his eyes and he resumed his examination of the curtains .They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour but were forced finally to conclude that the locket was not there .The sun had risen now its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows .It could be somewhere else in the house though said Hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged she seemed to have become more determined .Whether hed managed to destroy it or not hed want to keep it hidden from Voldemort wouldnt he ?Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time ?That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron Regulus might have put them there to protect the lockets hiding place even though we didnt realize it at .at .Harry and Ron looked at her .She was standing with one foot in midair with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated her eyes had even drifted out of focus . .at the time she finished in a whisper .Something wrong ?asked Ron .There was a locket .What ?said Harry and Ron together .In the cabinet in the drawing room .Nobody could open it .And we .we .Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach .He remembered He had even handled the thing as they passed it around each trying in turn to prise it open .It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy .Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us said Harry .It was the only chance the only slender hope left to them and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go .He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen .Cmon .He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time the other two thundering along in his wake .They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Siriuss mother as they passed through the hall .Filth .Mudbloods Scum she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them .Harry ran the length of the room skidded to a halt at the door of Kreachers cupboard and wrenched it open .There was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the houseelf had once slept but they were no longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged .The only thing there was an old copy of Natures Nobility A Wizarding Genealogy .Refusing to believe his eyes Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them .A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor .Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair Hermione closed her eyes .Its not over yet said Harry and he raised his voice and called Kreacherl There was a loud crack and the houseelf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace tiny half humansized his pale skin hanging off him in folds white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears .He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit .Master croaked Kreacher in his bullfrogs voice and he bowed low muttering to his knees back in my Mistresss old house with the bloodtraitor Weasley and the Mudblood I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor or ‘Mudblood growled Harry .He would have found Kreacher with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort .Ive got a question for you said Harry his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf and I order you to answer it truthfully .Understand ?Yes Master said Kreacher bowing low again Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter .Two years ago said Harry his heart now hammering against his ribs there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs .We threw it out .Did you steal it back ?There was a moments silence during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face .Then he said Yes .Where is it now ?asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful .Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word .Gone .Gone ?echoed Harry elation flooding out of him .What do you mean its gone ?The elf shivered .He swayed .Kreacher said Harry fiercely I order you Mundungus Fletcher croaked the elf his eyes still tight shut .Mundungus Fletcher stole it all Miss Bellas and Miss Cissys pictures my Mistresss gloves the Order of Merlin First Class the goblets with the family crest and and Kreacher was gulping for air His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream .and the locket Master Reguluss locket Kreacher did wrong Kreacher failed in his orders !Harry reacted instinctively As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate he launched himself upon the elf flattening him .Hermiones scream mingled with Kreachers but Harry bellowed louder than both of them Kreacher I order you to stay still !He felt the elf freeze and released him .Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor tears gushing from his sagging eyes .Harry let him up !Hermione whispered .So he can beat himself up with the poker ?snorted Harry kneeling beside the elf .I dont think so .Right Kreacher I want the truth How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket ?Kreacher saw him !gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth .Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreachers cupboard with his hands full of Kreachers treasures .Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and rran .You called the locket ‘Master Regulus s said Harry .Why ?Where did it come from ?What did Regulus have to do with it ?Kreacher sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket and everything Regulus had to do with it !The elf sat up curled into a ball placed his wet face between his knees and began to rock backward and forward .When he spoke his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent echoing kitchen .Master Sirius ran away good riddance for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistresss heart with his lawless ways .But Master Regulus had proper pride he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood .For years he talked of the Dark Lord who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggleborns .and when he was sixteen years old Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord .So proud so proud so happy to serve .And one day a year after he had joined Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher .Master Regulus always liked Kreacher .And Master Regulus said .he said .The old elf rocked faster than ever . .he said that the Dark Lord required an elf .Voldemort needed an elf ?Harry repeated looking around at Ron and Hermione who looked just as puzzled as he did .Oh yes moaned Kreacher .And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher .It was an honor said Master Regulus an honor for him and for Kreacher who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do .and then to ccome home .Kreacher rocked still faster his breath coming in sobs .So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord .The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea .And beyond the cave there was a cavern and in the cavern was a great black lake .The hairs on the back of Harrys neck stood up .Kreachers croaking voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water .He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present . .There was a boat .Of course there had been a boat Harry knew the boat ghostly green and tiny bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center .This then was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux by borrowing a disposable creature a houseelf .There was a bbasin full of potion on the island .The DDark Lord made Kreacher drink it .The elf quaked from head to foot .Kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible things .Kreachers insides burned .Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him he cried for his Mistress Black but the Dark Lord only laughed .He made Kreacher drink all the potion .He dropped a locket into the empty basin .He filled it with more potion .And then the Dark Lord sailed away leaving Kreacher on the island .Harry could see it happening .He watched Voldemorts white snakelike face vanishing into darkness those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning potion caused its victim .But here Harrys imagination could go no further for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped .Kreacher needed water he crawled to the islands edge and he drank from the black lake .and hands dead hands came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface .How did you get away ?Harry asked and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering .Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great bloodshot eyes .Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back he said .I know but how did you escape the Inferi ?Kreacher did not seem to understand .Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back he repeated .I know but Well its obvious isnt it Harry ?said Ron .He Disapparated !But .you couldnt Apparate in and out of that cave said Harry otherwise Dumbledore Elf magic isnt like wizards magic is it ?said Ron .I mean they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we cant .There was silence as Harry digested this .How could Voldemort have made such a mistake ?But even as he thought this Hermione spoke and her voice was icy .Of course Voldemort would have considered the ways of houseelves far beneath his notice just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals .It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didnt .The houseelfs highest law is his Masters bidding intoned Kreacher .Kreacher was told to come home so Kreacher came home .Well then you did what you were told didnt you ?said Hermione kindly .You didnt disobey orders at all !Kreacher shook his head rocking as fast as ever .So what happened when you got back ?Harry asked .What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened ?Master Regulus was very worried very worried croaked Kreacher .Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house .And then .it was a little while later .Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night and Master Regulus was strange not as he usually was disturbed in his mind Kreacher could tell .and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord .And so they had set off .Harry could visualize them quite clearly the frightened old elf and the thin dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius .Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern knew how to raise the tiny boat this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison .And he made you drink the potion ?said Harry disgusted .But Kreacher shook his head and wept .Hermiones hands leapt to her mouth She seemed to have understood something .MMaster Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had said Kreacher tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose .And he told Kreacher to take it and when the basin was empty to switch the lockets .Kreachers sobs came in great rasps now Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him .And he ordered Kreacher to leave without him .And he told Kreacher to go home and never to tell my Mistress what he had done but to destroy the first locket .And he drank all the potion and Kreacher swapped the lockets and watched .as Master Regulus .was dragged beneath the water .and .Oh Kreacher !wailed Hermione who was crying .She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him .At once he was on his feet cringing away from her quite obviously repulsed .The Mudblood touched Kreacher he will not allow it what would his Mistress say ?I told you not to call her ‘Mudblood !snarled Harry but the elf was already punishing himself He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor .Stop him stop him !Hermione cried .Oh dont you see now how sick it is the way theyve got to obey ?Kreacher stop stop !shouted Harry .The elf lay on the floor panting and shivering green mucus glistening around his snout a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears .Harry had never seen anything so pitiful .So you brought the locket home he said relentlessly for he was determined to know the full story .And you tried to destroy it ?Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it moaned the elf .Kreacher tried everything everything he knew but nothing nothing would work .So many powerful spells upon the casing Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it but it would not open .Kreacher punished himself he tried again he punished himself he tried again .Kreacher failed to obey orders Kreacher could not destroy the locket !And his Mistress was mad with grief because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened no because Master Regulus had ffforbidden him to tell any of the fffamily what happened in the ccave .Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words .Tears flowed down Hermiones cheeks as she watched Kreacher but she did not dare touch him again .Even Ron who was no fan of Kreachers looked troubled .Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head trying to clear it .I dont understand you Kreacher he said finally .Voldemort tried to kill you Regulus died to bring Voldemort down but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort ?You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix and pass information to Voldemort through them .Harry Kreacher doesnt think like that said Hermione wiping her eyes on the back of her hand .Hes a slave houseelves are used to bad even brutal treatment what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasnt that far out of the common way .What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher ?Hes loyal to people who are kind to him and Mrs Black must have been and Regulus certainly was so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs .I know what youre going to say she went on as Harry began to protest that Regulus changed his mind .but he doesnt seem to have explained that to Kreacher does he ?And I think I know why .Kreacher and Regulus s family were all safer if they kept to the old pureblood line .Regulus was trying to protect them all .Sirius Sirius was horrible to Kreacher Harry and its no good looking like that you know its true .Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here and he was probably starving for a bit of affection .Im sure ‘Miss Cissy and ‘Miss Bella were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know .Ive said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat houseelves .Well Voldemort did .and so did Sirius .Harry had no retort .As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him mere hours after Siriuss death I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans .Kreacher said Harry after a while when you feel up to it er .please sit up .It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence .Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child .Kreacher I am going to ask you to do something said Harry .He glanced at Hermione for assistance .He wanted to give the order kindly but at the same time he could not pretend that it was not an order .However the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval She smiled encouragingly .Kreacher I want you please to go and find Mundungus Fletcher .We need to find out where the locket where Master Reguluss locket is .Its really important .We want to finish the work Master Regulus started we want to er ensure that he didnt die in vain .Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry .Find Mundungus Fletcher ?he croaked .And bring him here to Grimmauld Place said Harry .Do you think you could do that for us ?As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet Harry had a sudden inspiration .He pulled out Hagrids purse and took out the fake Horcrux the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort .Kreacher Id er like you to have this he said pressing the locket into the elfs hand .This belonged to Regulus and Im sure hed want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you Overkill mate said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket let out a howl of shock and misery and threw himself back onto the ground .It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly .When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away .He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermiones direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute before Disapparating with the usual loud crack .THE BRIBE If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation .However Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon .By nightfall Harry felt discouraged and anxious and a supper composed largely of moldy bread upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations did nothing to help .Kreacher did not return the following day nor the day after that .However two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve and they remained there into the night gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see .Death Eaters for sure said Ron as he Harry and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows .Reckon they know were in here ?I dont think so said Hermione though she looked frightened or theyd have sent Snape in after us wouldnt they ?Dyou reckon hes been in here and had his tongue tied by Moodys curse ?asked Ron .Yes said Hermione otherwise hed have been able to tell that lot how to get in wouldnt he ?But theyre probably watching to see whether we turn up .They know that Harry owns the house after all .How do they ?began Harry .Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry remember ?Theyll know Sirius left you the place .The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve .They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr Weasleys Patronus and the strain was starting to tell .Restless and irritable Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket This particularly infuriated Hermione who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off .Will you stop it !she cried on the third evening of Kreachers absence as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again .Sorry sorry !said Ron clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights .I dont know Im doing it !Well cant you find something useful to occupy yourself ?What like reading kids stories ?Dumbledore left me this book Ron and he left me the Deluminator maybe Im supposed to use it !Unable to stand the bickering Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them .He headed downstairs toward the kitchen which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear .Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall however he heard a tap on the front door then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain .Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten He pulled out his wand moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads and waited .The door opened He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it .The intruder took a step forward and Moodys voice asked Severus Snape ?Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him raising its dead hand .It was not I who killed you Albus said a quiet voice .The jinx broke The dustfigure exploded again and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind .Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it .Dont move !He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs Black At the sound of his yell the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry wands pointing like his at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below .Hold your fire its me Remus !Oh thank goodness said Hermione weakly pointing her wand at Mrs Black instead with a bang the curtains swished shut again and silence fell .Ron too lowered his wand but Harry did not .Show yourself !he called back .Lupin moved forward into the lamplight hands still held high in a gesture of surrender .I am Remus John Lupin werewolf sometimes known as Moony one of the four creators of the Marauders Map married to Nymphadora usually known as Tonks and I taught you how to produce a Patronus Harry which takes the form of a stag .Oh all right said Harry lowering his wand but I had to check didnt I ?Speaking as your exDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher I quite agree that you had to check .Ron Hermione you shouldnt be quite so quick to lower your defenses .They ran down the stairs toward him .Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak he looked exhausted but pleased to see them .No sign of Severus then ?he asked .No said Harry .Whats going on ?Is everyone okay ?Yes said Lupin but were all being watched .There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside We know I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me .They cant know youre in here or Im sure theyd have more people out there theyre staking out everywhere thats got any connection with you Harry .Lets go downstairs theres a lot to tell you and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow .They descended into the kitchen where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate .A fire sprang up instantly It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table .Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down .Id have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me said Lupin .So you came straight here after the wedding ?No said Harry only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a cafe on Tottenham Court Road .Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front .What ?They explained what had happened when they had finished Lupin looked aghast .But how did they find you so quickly ?Its impossible to track anyone who Apparates unless you grab hold of them as they disappear !And it doesnt seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time does it ?said Harry .We wondered said Hermione tentatively whether Harry could still have the Trace on him ?Impossible said Lupin .Ron looked smug and Harry felt hugely relieved .Apart from anything else theyd know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him wouldnt they ?But I cant see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road thats worrying really worrying .He looked disturbed but as far as Harry was concerned that question could wait .Tell us what happened after we left we havent heard a thing since Rons dad told us the family were safe .Well Kingsley saved us said Lupin .Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived .Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people ?interjected Hermione .A mixture but to all intents and purposes theyre the same thing now said Lupin .There were about a dozen of them but they didnt know you were there Harry .Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him if its true he didnt give you away .Harry looked at Ron and Hermione their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt .He had never liked Scrimgeour much but if what Lupin said was true the mans final act had been to try to protect Harry .The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom Lupin went on .They found the ghoul but didnt want to get too close and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours .They were trying to get information on you Harry but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there .At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Orderconnected house in the country .No deaths he added quickly forestalling the question but they were rough .They burned down Dedalus Diggles house but as you know he wasnt there and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonkss family .Again trying to find out where you went after you visited them .Theyre all right shaken obviously but otherwise okay .The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms ?Harry asked remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonkss parents garden .What youve got to realize Harry is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now said Lupin .Theyve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest .They managed to penetrate every defensive spell wed cast against them and once inside they were completely open about why theyd come .And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harrys whereabouts out of people ?asked Hermione an edge to her voice .Well said Lupin .He hesitated then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet Here he said pushing it across the table to Harry youll know sooner or later anyway .Thats their pretext for going after you .Harry smoothed out the paper .A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page .He read the headline over it WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage but Harry said nothing .He pushed the newspaper away he did not want to read any more He knew what it would say .Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen .Im sorry Harry Lupin said .So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too ?asked Hermione furiously .Lupin nodded .But surely people realize whats going on ?The coup has been smooth and virtually silent said Lupin .The official version of Scrimgeours murder is that he resigned he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse who is under the Imperius Curse .Why didnt Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic ?asked Ron .Lupin laughed .He doesnt need to Ron .Effectively he is the Minister but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry ?His puppet Thicknesse is taking care of everyday business leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry .Naturally many people have deduced what has happened There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it .However that is the point They whisper .They darent confide in each other not knowing whom to trust they are scared to speak out in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted .Yes Voldemort is playing a very clever game .Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion Remaining masked has created confusion uncertainty and fear .And this dramatic change in Ministry policy said Harry involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort ?Thats certainly part of it said Lupin and it is a masterstroke .Now that Dumbledore is dead you the Boy Who Lived were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort .But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old heros death Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you .Meanwhile the Ministry has started moving against Muggleborns .Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet Look at page two .Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art ‘Muggleborn Register she read aloud . ‘The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of socalled Muggleborns the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets . ‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce .Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists therefore the so called Muggleborn is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force . ‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power and to this end has issued an invitation to every socalled Muggleborn to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggleborn Registration Commission .People wont let this happen said Ron .It is happening Ron said Lupin .Muggleborns are being rounded up as we speak .But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen magic ?said Ron .Its mental if you could steal magic there wouldnt be any Squibs would there ?I know said Lupin .Nevertheless unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment .Ron glanced at Hermione then said What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggleborns part of their family ?Ill tell everyone Hermione s my cousin Hermione covered Rons hand with hers and squeezed it .Thank you Ron but I couldnt let you You wont have a choice said Ron fiercely gripping her hand back .Ill teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it .Hermione gave a shaky laugh .Ron as were on the run with Harry Potter the most wanted person in the country I dont think it matters .If I was going back to school it would be different .Whats Voldemort planning for Hogwarts ?she asked Lupin .Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard he replied .That was announced yesterday .Its a change because it was never obligatory before .Of course nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred .This way Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age .And its also another way of weeding out Muggleborns because students must be given Blood Status meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent before they are allowed to attend .Harry felt sickened and angry At this moment excited elevenyearolds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks unaware that they would never see Hogwarts perhaps never see their families again either .Its .its .he muttered struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts but Lupin said quietly I know .Lupin hesitated .Ill understand if you cant confirm this Harry but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission .He did Harry replied and Ron and Hermione are in on it and theyre coming with me .Can you confide in me what the mission is ?Harry looked into the prematurely lined face framed in thick but graying hair and wished that he could return a different answer .I cant Remus Im sorry .If Dumbledore didnt tell you I dont think I can .I thought youd say that said Lupin looking disappointed .But I might still be of some use to you .You know what I am and what I can do .I could come with you to provide protection .There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to .Harry hesitated .It was a very tempting offer though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine .Hermione however looked puzzled .But what about Tonks ?she asked .What about her ?said Lupin .Well said Hermione frowning youre married !How does she feel about you going away with us ?Tonks will be perfectly safe said Lupin .Shell be at her parents house .There was something strange in Lupins tone it was almost cold .There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents house she was after all a member of the Order and as far as Harry knew was likely to want to be in the thick of the action .Remus said Hermione tentatively is everything all right .you know .between you and Everything is fine thank you said Lupin pointedly .Hermione turned pink .There was another pause an awkward and embarrassed one and then Lupin said with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant Tonks is going to have a baby .Oh how wonderful !squealed Hermione .Excellent !said Ron enthusiastically .Congratulations said Harry .Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace then said So .do you accept my offer ?Will three become four ?I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher after all .And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined .Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry .Just just to be clear he said .You want to leave Tonks at her parents house and come away with us ?Shell be perfectly safe there theyll look after her said Lupin .He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference .Harry Im sure James would have wanted me to stick with you .Well said Harry slowly Im not .Im pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you arent sticking with your own kid actually .Lupins face drained of color .The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees .Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it while Hermione s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin .You dont understand said Lupin at last .Explain then said Harry .Lupin swallowed .I I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks .I did it against my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since .I see said Harry so youre just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us ?Lupin sprang to his feet His chair toppled over backward and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw for the first time ever the shadow of the wolf upon his human face .Dont you understand what Ive done to my wife and my unborn child ?I should never have married her Ive made her an outcast !Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned .You have only ever seen me amongst the Order or under Dumbledores protection at Hogwarts !You dont know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me !When they know of my affliction they can barely talk to me !Dont you see what Ive done ?Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf ?And the child the child Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair he looked quite deranged .My kind dont usually breed !It will be like me I am convinced of it how can I forgive myself when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child ?And if by some miracle it is not like me then it will be better off a hundred times so without a father of whom it must always be ashamed !Remus !whispered Hermione tears in her eyes .Dont say that how could any child be ashamed of you ?Oh I dont know Hermione said Harry .Id be pretty ashamed of him .Harry did not know where his rage was coming from but it had propelled him to his feet too .Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him .If the new regime thinks Muggleborns are bad Harry said what will they do to a halfwerewolf whose fathers in the Order ?My father died trying to protect my mother and me and you reckon hed tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us ?How how dare you ?said Lupin .This is not about a desire for for danger or personal glory how dare you suggest such a I think youre feeling a bit of a daredevil Harry said .You fancy stepping into Siriuss shoes Harry no !Hermione begged him but he continued to glare into Lupins livid face .Id never have believed this Harry said .The man who taught me to fight dementors a coward .Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor he glimpsed the tail of Lupins cloak disappearing around the door .Remus Remus come back !Hermione cried but Lupin did not respond .A moment later they heard the front door slam .Harry !wailed Hermione .How could you ?It was easy said Harry .He stood up he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall .He was still so full of anger he was shaking .Dont look at me like that !he snapped at Hermione .Dont you start on her !snarled Ron .No no we mustnt fight !said Hermione launching herself between them .You shouldnt have said that stuff to Lupin Ron told Harry .He had it coming to him said Harry .Broken images were racing each other through his mind Sirius falling through the veil Dumbledore suspended broken in midair a flash of green light and his mothers voice begging for mercy .Parents said Harry shouldnt leave their kids unless unless theyve got to .Harry said Hermione stretching out a consoling hand but he shrugged it off and walked away his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured .He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace seeking reassurance about James and Lupin had consoled him .Now Lupins tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him .He felt a sickening surge of remorse .Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back communicating silently .He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other .I know I shouldnt have called him a coward .No you shouldnt said Ron at once .But hes acting like one .All the same .said Hermione .I know said Harry .But if it makes him go back to Tonks itll be worth it wont it ?He could not keep the plea out of his voice .Hermione looked sympathetic Ron uncertain .Harry looked down at his feet thinking of his father .Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend ?The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione s unspoken reproaches .The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table Harrys own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page .He walked over to it and sat down opened the paper at random and pretended to read .He could not take in the words his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin .He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet He turned a page loudly and Dumbledores name leapt out at him .It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph which showed a family group .Beneath the photograph were the words The Dumbledore family left to right Albus Percival holding newborn Ariana Kendra and Aberforth .His attention caught Harry examined the picture more carefully .Dumbledores father Percival was a goodlooking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph .The baby Ariana was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctivelooking .The mother Kendra had jetblack hair pulled into a high bun .Her face had a carved quality about it .Harry thought of photos of Native Americans hed seen as he studied her dark eyes high cheekbones and straight nose formally composed above a highnecked silk gown .Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical shoulderlength hairstyles .Albus looked several years older but otherwise the two boys looked very alike for this was before Albus s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses .The family looked quite happy and normal smiling serenely up out of the newspaper .Baby Arianas arm waved vaguely out of her shawl .Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE by Rita Skeeter Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did Harry began to read Proud and haughty Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in MouldontheWold after her husband Percivals wellpublicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban .She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godrics Hollow the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potters strange escape from YouKnowWho .Like MouldontheWold Godrics Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families but as Kendra knew none of them she would be spared the curiosity about her husbands crime she had faced in her former village .By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors she soon ensured that her family was left well alone .Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes says Bathilda Bagshot .The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys .Wouldnt have known there was a daughter if I hadnt been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden .Walked her round the lawn once keeping a firm grip on her then took her back inside .Didnt know what to make of it .It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godrics Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all something she had probably been planning for years .The timing was significant .Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself if present .Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability .It seems clear therefore that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughters existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib .Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would of course make imprisoning her all the easier .The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Arianas existence could be counted upon to keep the secret including her two brothers who deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them My sister is too frail for school .Next week Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts the Prizes and the Pretense .Harry had been wrong What he had read had indeed made him feel worse .He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family .Was it true ?How could he find out ?He wanted to go to Godrics Hollow even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones .He was in the process of lowering the newspaper to ask Rons and Hermiones opinions when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen .For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher .His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room and for a split second he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair .He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and bowing low to Harry croaked Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher Master .Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand Hermione however was too quick for him .Expelliarmusl Mundungus s wand soared into the air and Hermione caught it .Wildeyed Mundungus dived for the stairs Ron rugbytackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch .What ?he bellowed writhing in his attempts to free himself from Rons grip .Whave I done ?Setting a bleedin ouseelf on me what are you playing at whave I done lemme go lemme go or Youre not in much of a position to make threats said Harry .He threw aside the newspaper crossed the kitchen in a few strides and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus who stopped struggling and looked terrified .Ron got up panting and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus s nose .Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke His hair was matted and his robes stained .Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief Master croaked the elf .Fletcher knows how to avoid capture has many hideyholes and accomplices .Nevertheless Kreacher cornered the thief in the end .Youve done really well Kreacher said Harry and the elf bowed low .Right weve got a few questions for you Harry told Mundungus who shouted at once I panicked okay ?I never wanted to come along no offense mate but I never volunteered to die for you an that was bleedin YouKnowWho come flying at me anyone woulda got outta there I said all along I didnt wanna do it For your information none of the rest of us Disapparated said Hermione .Well youre a bunch of bleedin eroes then arent you but I never pretended I was up for killing meself Were not interested in why you ran out on Mad Eye said Harry moving his wand a little closer to Mundunguss baggy bloodshot eyes .We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum .Well then why the ell am I being unted down by ouseelves ?Or is this about them goblets again ?I aint got none of em left or you could ave em Its not about the goblets either although youre getting warmer said Harry .Shut up and listen .It felt wonderful to have something to do someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth .Harrys wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundunguss nose that Mundungus had gone cross eyed trying to keep it in view .When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable Harry began but Mundungus interrupted him again .Sirius never cared about any of the junk There was the sound of pattering feet a blaze of shining copper an echoing clang and a shriek of agony Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan .Call im off call im off e should be locked up !screamed Mundungus cowering as Kreacher raised the heavybottomed pan again .Kreacher no !shouted Harry .Kreachers thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan still held aloft .Perhaps just one more Master Harry for luck ?Ron laughed .We need him conscious Kreacher but if he needs persuading you can do the honors said Harry .Thank you very much Master said Kreacher with a bow and he retreated a short distance his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing .When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find Harry began again you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard .There was a locket there .Harrys mouth was suddenly dry He could sense Ron and Hermiones tension and excitement too .What did you do with it ?Why ?asked Mundungus .Is it valuable ?Youve still got it !cried Hermione .No he hasnt said Ron shrewdly .Hes wondering whether he should have asked more money for it .More ?said Mundungus .That wouldnt have been effing difficult .bleedin gave it away din I ?No choice .What do you mean ?I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if Ive got a license for trading in magical artifacts .Bleedin snoop .She was gonna fine me but she took a fancy to the locket an told me shed take it and let me off that time and to fink meself lucky .Who was this woman ?asked Harry .I dunno some Ministry hag .Mundungus considered for a moment brow wrinkled .Little woman .Bow on top of er head .He frowned and then added Looked like a toad .Harry dropped his wand It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows which ignited .Aguamenti screamed Hermione and a jet of water streamed from her wand engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus .Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Rons and Hermiones faces .The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again .MAGIC IS MIGHT As August wore on the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown .The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses and nor was number twelve itself .The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen .And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing .Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose or so it seemed than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen watching the join between the two houses .The lurkers were never the same two days running although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing .Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice though occasionally one of them might glance back wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat .The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil .Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly as if they had seen something interesting at last only to fall back looking disappointed .On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before .Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive .As evening drew in bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting .The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion a podgy pallid man started forward but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity looking frustrated and disappointed .Meanwhile inside number twelve Harry had just entered the hall .He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow .Shutting the front door carefully behind him he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak draped it over his arm and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand .The usual low whisper of Severus Snape ?greeted him the chill wind swept him and his tongue rolled up for a moment .I didnt kill you he said once it had unrolled then held his breath as the dusty jinxfigure exploded .He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen out of earshot of Mrs Black and clear of the dust cloud before calling Ive got news and you wont like it .The kitchen was almost unrecognizable .Every surface now shone Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow the wooden tabletop gleamed the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire on which a cauldron was simmering .Nothing in the room however was more dramatically different than the houseelf who now came hurrying toward Harry dressed in a snowywhite towel his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool Reguluss locket bouncing on his thin chest .Shoes off if you please Master Harry and hands washed before dinner croaked Kreacher seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall beside a number of oldfashioned robes that had been freshly laundered .Whats happened ?Ron asked apprehensively .He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and handdrawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment .A large picture of a familiar hooknosed blackhaired man stared up at them all beneath a headline that read SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER No !said Ron and Hermione loudly .Hermione was quickest she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud . ‘Severus Snape longstanding Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school .Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother Amycus fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor .7 welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values Like committing murder and cutting off peoples ears I suppose !Snape headmaster !Snape in Dumbledores study Merlins pants !she shrieked making both Harry and Ron jump .She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room shouting as she went Ill be back in a minute ! ‘Merlins pants ?repeated Ron looking amused .She must be upset .He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape .The other teachers wont stand for this .McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth they know how Dumbledore died .They wont accept Snape as headmaster .And who are these Carrows ?Death Eaters said Harry .There are pictures of them inside .They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore so its all friends together .And Harry went on bitterly drawing up a chair I cant see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay .If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape itll be a choice between staying and teaching or a nice few years in Azkaban and thats if theyre lucky .I reckon theyll stay to try and protect the students .Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands and ladled out soup into pristine bowls whistling between his teeth as he did so .Thanks Kreacher said Harry flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape s face .Well at least we know exactly where Snape is now .He began to spoon soup into his mouth .The quality of Kreachers cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Reguluss locket Todays French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted .There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house he told Ron as he ate more than usual .Its like theyre hoping well march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express .Ron glanced at his watch .Ive been thinking about that all day .It left nearly six hours ago .Weird not being on it isnt it ?In his minds eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air shimmering between fields and hills a rippling scarlet caterpillar .He was sure Ginny Neville and Luna were sitting together at this moment perhaps wondering where he Ron and Hermione were or debating how best to undermine Snape s new regime .They nearly saw me coming back in just now Harry said .I landed badly on the top step and the Cloak slipped .I do that every time .Oh here she is Ron added craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen .And what in the name of Merlins most baggy Y Fronts was that about ?I remembered this Hermione panted .She was carrying a large framed picture which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard .Opening it she proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag within a few seconds it had vanished like so much else into the bags capacious depths .Phineas Nigellus Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous clanking crash .Sorry ?said Ron but Harry understood .The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmasters office at Hogwarts the circular towertop room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now in triumphant possession of Dumbledores collection of delicate silver magical instruments the stone Pensieve the Sorting Hat and unless it had been moved elsewhere the sword of Gryffindor .Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat .But let him try it now all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag .Good thinking !said Ron looking impressed .Thank you smiled Hermione pulling her soup toward her .So Harry what else happened today ?Nothing said Harry .Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours .No sign of her .Saw your dad though Ron .He looks fine .Ron nodded his appreciation of this news .They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers .It was however reassuring to catch these glimpses of him even if he did look very strained and anxious .Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work Ron said .Thats why we havent seen Umbridge shed never walk shed think shes too important .And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes ?Hermione asked .Oh yeah the bloke from Magical Maintenance said Ron .How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance ?Hermione asked her soupspoon suspended in midair .Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes .But you never told us that !Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen .Theres nothing in here about navy blue robes nothing !she said flipping feverishly through the pages .Well does it really matter ?Ron it all matters !If were going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when theyre bound to be on the lookout for intruders every little detail matters !Weve been over and over this I mean whats the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you arent even bothering to tell us Blimey Hermione I forget one little thing You do realize dont you that theres probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of I think we should do it tomorrow said Harry .Hermione stopped dead her jaw hanging Ron choked a little over his soup .Tomorrow ?repeated Hermione .You arent serious Harry ?I am said Harry .I dont think were going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month .The longer we put it off the farther away that locket could be .Theres already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away the thing doesnt open .Unless said Ron shes found a way of opening it and shes now possessed .Wouldnt make any difference to her she was so evil in the first place Harry shrugged .Hermione was biting her lip deep in thought .We know everything important Harry went on addressing Hermione .We know theyve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry .We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it .And we know roughly where Umbridges office is because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate ‘Ill be up on level one Dolores wants to see me Hermione recited immediately .Exactly said Harry .And we know you get in using those funny coins or tokens or whatever they are because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend But we havent got any !If the plan works we will have Harry continued calmly .I dont know Harry I dont know .There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong so much relies on chance .Thatll be true even if we spend another three months preparing said Harry .Its time to act .He could tell from Rons and Hermiones faces that they were scared he was not particularly confident himself and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation .They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry which Ron thanks to Mr Weasley had known since childhood .They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in eavesdropped on their conversations and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear alone at the same time every day .Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebodys briefcase .Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione .All right said Ron slowly lets say we go for it tomorrow .I think it should just be me and Harry .Oh dont start that again !sighed Hermione .I thought wed settled this .Its one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak but this is different Hermione .Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously .Youre on the list of Muggle borns who didnt present themselves for interrogation !And youre supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow !If anyone shouldnt go its Harry hes got a tenthousandGalleon price on his head Fine Ill stay here said Harry .Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort wont you ?As Ron and Hermione laughed pain shot through the scar on Harrys forehead .His hand jumped to it He saw Hermiones eyes narrow and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes .Well if all three of us go well have to Disapparate separately Ron was saying .We cant all fit under the Cloak anymore .Harrys scar was becoming more and more painful .He stood up .At once Kreacher hurried forward .Master has not finished his soup would Master prefer the savory stew or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial ?Thanks Kreacher but Ill be back in a minute er bathroom .Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again .Grunting with pain he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of openmouthed serpents and closed his eyes .He was gliding along a twilit street .The buildings on either side of him had high timbered gables they looked like gingerbread houses .He approached one of them then saw the whiteness of his own longfingered hand against the door .He knocked .He felt a mounting excitement .The door opened A laughing woman stood there .Her face fell as she looked into Harrys face humor gone terror replacing it .Gregorovitch ?said a high cold voice .She shook her head She was trying to close the door .A white hand held it steady prevented her shutting him out .I want Gregorovitch .Er wohnt hier nicht mehr she cried shaking her head .He no live here !He no live here !I know him not !Abandoning the attempt to close the door she began to back away down the dark hall and Harry followed gliding toward her and his longfingered hand had drawn his wand .Where is he ?Das weifi ich nichti He move !I know not I know not !He raised the wand .She screamed .Two young children came running into the hall .She tried to shield them with her arms .There was a flash of green light Harry !HARRY !He opened his eyes he had sunk to the floor .Hermione was pounding on the door again .Harry open up !He had shouted out he knew it .He got up and unbolted the door Hermione toppled inside at once regained her balance and looked around suspiciously .Ron was right behind her looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom .What were you doing ?asked Hermione sternly .What dyou think I was doing ?asked Harry with feeble bravado .You were yelling your head off !said Ron .Oh yeah .I mustve dozed off or Harry please dont insult our intelligence said Hermione taking deep breaths .We know your scar hurt downstairs and youre white as a sheet .Harry sat down on the edge of the bath .Fine .Ive just seen Voldemort murdering a woman .By now hes probably killed her whole family .And he didnt need to .It was Cedric all over again they were just there .Harry you arent supposed to let this happen anymore !Hermione cried her voice echoing through the bathroom .Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency !He thought the connection was dangerous Voldemort can use it Harry !What good is it to watch him kill and torture how can it help ?Because it means I know what hes doing said Harry .So youre not even going to try to shut him out ?Hermione I cant .You know Im lousy at Occlumency I never got the hang of it .You never really tried !she said hotly .I dont get it Harry do you like having this special connection or relationship or what whatever She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up .Like it ?he said quietly .Would you like it ?I no Im sorry Harry I didnt mean I hate it I hate the fact that he can get inside me that I have to watch him when hes most dangerous .But Im going to use it .Dumbledore Forget Dumbledore .This is my choice nobody elses .I want to know why hes after Gregorovitch .Who ?Hes a foreign wandmaker said Harry .He made Krums wand and Krum reckons hes brilliant .But according to you said Ron Voldemorts got Ollivander locked up somewhere .If hes already got a wandmaker what does he need another one for ?Maybe he agrees with Krum maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better .or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me because Ollivander didnt know .Harry glanced into the cracked dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back .Harry you keep talking about what your wand did said Hermione but you made it happen !Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power ?Because I know it wasnt me !And so does Voldemort Hermione !We both know what really happened !They glared at each other Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemorts mind .To his relief Ron intervened .Drop it he advised her .Its up to him .And if were going to the Ministry tomorrow dont you reckon we should go over the plan ?Reluctantly as the other two could tell Hermione let the matter rest though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity .In the meantime they returned to the basement kitchen where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart .They did not get to bed until late that night after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it word perfect to each other .Harry who was now sleeping in Siriuss room lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father Sirius Lupin and Pettigrew and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes .As he extinguished his wand however he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion Puking Pastilles or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly .Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste .You look terrible was Rons greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry .Not for long said Harry yawning .They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen .She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review .Robes she said under her breath acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag Polyjuice Potion .Invisibility Cloak .Decoy Detonators .You should each take a couple just in case .Puking Pastilles Nosebleed Nougat Extendable Ears .They gulped down their breakfast then set off upstairs Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steakandkidney pie ready for them when they returned .Bless him said Ron fondly and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall .They made their way onto the front step with immense caution They could see a couple of puffy eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square .Hermione Disapparated with Ron first then came back for Harry .After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place .It was as yet deserted except for a couple of large bins the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight oclock .Right then said Hermione checking her watch .She ought to be here in about five minutes .When Ive Stunned her Hermione we know said Ron sternly .And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here ?Hermione squealed .I nearly forgot !Stand back She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them which burst open with a crash .The dark corridor behind it led as they knew from their careful scouting trips into an empty theater .Hermione pulled the door back toward her to make it look as though it was still closed .And now she said turning back to face the other two in the alleyway we put on the Cloak again and we wait Ron finished throwing it over Hermione s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry .Little more than a minute later there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them blinking a little in the sudden brightness the sun had just come out from behind a cloud .She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth however before Hermione s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over .Nicely done Hermione said Ron emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak .Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage .Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witchs head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag .Ron was rummaging through the little witchs handbag .Shes Mafalda Hopkirk he said reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office .Youd better take this Hermione and here are the tokens .He passed her several small golden coins all embossed with the letters M .O .M .which he had taken from the witchs purse .Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion which was now a pleasant heliotrope color and within seconds stood before them the double of Mafalda Hopkirk .As she removed Mafaldas spectacles and put them on Harry checked his watch .Were running late Mr Magical Maintenance will be here any second .They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view waiting .Seconds later there was another pop and a small ferretylooking wizard appeared before them .Oh hello Mafalda .Hello !said Hermione in a quavery voice .How are you today ?Not so good actually replied the little wizard who looked thoroughly downcast .As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road Harry and Ron crept along behind them .Im sorry to hear youre under the weather said Hermione talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems it was essential to stop him from reaching the street .Here have a sweet .Eh ?Oh no thanks I insist !said Hermione aggressively shaking the bag of pastilles in his face .Looking rather alarmed the little wizard took one .The effect was instantaneous .The moment the pastille touched his tongue the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head .Oh dear !she said as he splattered the alley with sick .Perhaps youd better take the day off !No no !He choked and retched trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight .I must today must go But thats just silly !said Hermione alarmed .You cant go to work in this state I think you ought to go to St .Mungos and get them to sort you out !The wizard had collapsed heaving onto all fours still trying to crawl toward the main street .You simply cant go to work like this !cried Hermione .At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words .Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position he turned on the spot and vanished leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit .Urgh said Hermione holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick .It would have made much less mess to Stun him too .Yeah said Ron emerging from under the cloak holding the wizards bag but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention .Keen on his job though isnt he ?Chuck us the hair and the potion then .Within two minutes Ron stood before them as small and ferrety as the sick wizard and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag .Weird he wasnt wearing them today wasnt it seeing how much he wanted to go ?Anyway Im Reg Cattermole according to the label in the back .Now wait here Hermione told Harry who was still under the Invisibility Cloak and well be back with some hairs for you .He had to wait ten minutes but it seemed much longer to Harry skulking alone in the sicksplattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda .Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared .We dont know who he is Hermione said passing Harry several curly black hairs but hes gone home with a dreadful nosebleed !Here hes pretty tall youll need bigger robes .She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them and Harry retired to take the potion and change .Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and from what he could tell from his wellmuscled arms powerfully built .He also had a beard .Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes he rejoined the other two .Blimey thats scary said Ron looking up at Harry who now towered over him .Take one of Mafaldas tokens Hermione told Harry and lets go its nearly nine .They stepped out of the alleyway together .Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps one labeled GENTLEMEN the other LADIES .See you in a moment then said Hermione nervously and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES .Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet tiled in grimy black and white .Morning Reg !called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door .Blooming pain in the bum this eh ?Forcing us all to get to work this way !Who are they expecting to turn up Harry Potter ?The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit .Ron gave a forced chuckle .Yeah he said stupid isnt it ?And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles .To Harrys left and right came the sound of flushing .He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door .He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him .We have to flush ourselves in ?he whispered .Looks like it Harry whispered back his voice came out deep and gravelly .They both stood up .Feeling exceptionally foolish Harry clambered into the toilet .He knew at once that he had done the right thing though he appeared to be standing in water his shoes feet and robes remained quite dry .He reached up pulled the chain and next moment had zoomed down a short chute emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic .He got up clumsily there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to .The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it .Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls .Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene .It was rather frightening this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them .Engraved in foothigh letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT .Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him .Out of the way cant y oh sorry Runcorn !Clearly frightened the balding wizard hurried away .Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating Runcorn was intimidating .Psst !said a voice and he looked around to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue .Harry hastened to join them .You got in all right then ?Hermione whispered to Harry .No hes still stuck in the bog said Ron .Oh very funny .Its horrible isnt it ?she said to Harry who was staring up at the statue .Have you seen what theyre sitting on ?Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies men women and children all with rather stupid ugly faces twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards .Muggles whispered Hermione .In their rightful place .Come on lets get going .They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall looking around as surreptitiously as possible but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge .They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts .They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said Cattermole !They looked around Harrys stomach turned over .One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledores death was striding toward them .The Ministry workers beside them fell silent their eyes downcast Harry could feel fear rippling through them .The mans scowling slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent sweeping robes which were embroidered with much gold thread .Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically Morning Yaxley !Yaxley ignored them .I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office Cattermole .Its still raining in there .Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene but nobody spoke .Raining .in your office ?Thats thats not good is it ?Ron gave a nervous laugh .Yaxleys eyes widened .You think its funny Cattermole do you ?A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off .No said Ron no of course You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife Cattermole ?In fact Im quite surprised youre not down there holding her hand while she waits .Already given her up as a bad job have you ?Probably wise .Be sure and marry a pureblood next time .Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror .Yaxley looked at her .She coughed feebly and turned away .I I stammered Ron .But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood said Yaxley not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing I would make it my priority to do that job Cattermole .Do you understand me ?Yes whispered Ron .Then attend to it Cattermole and if my office is not completely dry within an hour your wifes Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now .The golden grille before them clattered open .With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole Yaxley swept away toward another lift .Harry Ron and Hermione entered theirs but nobody followed them It was as if they were infectious .The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward .What am I going to do ?Ron asked the other two at once he looked stricken .If I dont turn up my wife I mean Cattermole s wife Well come with you we should stick together began Harry but Ron shook his head feverishly .Thats mental we havent got much time .You two find Umbridge Ill go and sort out Yaxleys office but how do I stop it raining ?Try Finite Incantatem said Hermione at once that should stop the rain if its a hex or curse if it doesnt somethings gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm which will be more difficult to fix so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings Say it again slowly said Ron searching his pockets desperately for a quill but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt .A disembodied female voice said Level four Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures incorporating Beast Being and Spirit Divisions Goblin Liaison Office and Pest Advisory Bureau and the grilles slid open again admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift .Morning Albert said a bushily whiskered man smiling at Harry .He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron .The wizard leaned toward Harry leering and muttered Dirk Cresswell eh ?From Goblin Liaison ?Nice one Albert .Im pretty confident Ill get his job now !He winked .Harry smiled back hoping that this would suffice .The lift stopped the grilles opened once more .Level two Department of Magical Law Enforcement including the Improper Use of Magic Office Auror Headquarters and Wizengamot Administration Services said the disembodied witchs voice .Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift followed by the other wizards leaving Harry and Hermione alone .The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said very fast Actually Harry I think Id better go after him I dont think he knows what hes doing and if he gets caught the whole thing Level one Minister of Magic and Support Staff .The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped .Four people stood before them two of them deep in conversation a longhaired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold and a squat toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest .THE MUGGLEBORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION Ah Mafalda !said Umbridge looking at Hermione .Travers sent you did he ?Yyes squeaked Hermione .Good youll do perfectly well .Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold .Thats that problem solved Minister if Mafalda can be spared for recordkeeping we shall be able to start straightaway .She consulted her clipboard .Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee !Tut tut .even here in the heart of the Ministry !She stepped into the lift beside Hermione as did the two wizards who had been listening to Umbridges conversation with the Minister .Well go straight down Mafalda youll find everything you need in the courtroom .Good morning Albert arent you getting out ?Yes of course said Harry in Runcorns deep voice .Harry stepped out of the lift .The golden grilles clanged shut behind him .Glancing over his shoulder Harry saw Hermiones anxious face sinking back out of sight a tall wizard on either side of her Umbridges velvet hairbow level with her shoulder .What brings you up here Runcorn ?asked the new Minister of Magic .His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock .Needed a quick word with Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second Arthur Weasley .Someone said he was up on level one .Ah said Pius Thicknesse .Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable ?No said Harry his throat dry .No nothing like that .Ah well .Its only a matter of time said Thicknesse .If you ask me the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods .Good day Runcorn .Good day Minister .Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor .The moment the Minister had passed out of sight Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak threw it over himself and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction .Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden .Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach .As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door each bearing a small plaque with the owners name and occupation upon it the might of the Ministry its complexity its impenetrability seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish .They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected They had not given a moments thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate .Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings which would undoubtedly last hours Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him a womans liberty possibly depending on the outcome and he Harry was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift .He stopped walking leaned against a wall and tried to decide what to do .The silence pressed upon him There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here the purplecarpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place .Her office must be up here Harry thought .It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure .He therefore set off along the corridor again passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him scribbling on a trail of parchment .Now paying attention to the names on the doors Harry turned a corner .Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks though much more highly polished and free from graffiti .Harry paused to watch them for the effect was quite mesmerizing .They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites .After a few seconds Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized that what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets that the paper squares were pages which when assembled folded and magicked into place fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard .Harry crept closer although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpetmuffled footstep and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch .He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak .Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title MUDBLOODS and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful PureBlood Society Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl .There was no authors name upon the pamphlet but again the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it .Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said still waving and twirling her wand Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day does anyone know ?Careful said the wizard beside her glancing around nervously one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor .What has she got magic ears as well as an eye now ?The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphletmakers Harry looked too and rage reared in him like a snake .Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door a large round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody .For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there He even forgot that he was invisible .He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye .It was not moving It gazed blindly upward frozen .The plaque beneath it read DOLORES UMBRIDGE SENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read HEAD OF THE MUGGLEBORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION Harry looked back at the dozen pamphletmakers Though they were intent upon their work he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them .He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubberbulbed horn for a body .Crouching down beneath the Cloak he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground .It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him .A few moments later during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner .The young witch in the front row shrieked Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up looking around for the source of the commotion .Harry turned the doorknob stepped into Umbridges office and closed the door behind him .He felt he had stepped back in time .The room was exactly like Umbridges office at Hogwarts Lace draperies doilies and dried flowers covered every available surface .The walls bore the same ornamental plates each featuring a highly colored beribboned kitten gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness .The desk was covered with a flouncy flowered cloth .Behind MadEyes eye a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door .Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator .He wrenched the telescope out of the door leaving a hole behind pulled the magical eyeball out of it and placed it in his pocket .Then he turned to face the room again raised his wand and murmured Accio Locket .Nothing happened but he had not expected it to no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells .He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers .He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips but no sign of a locket .There was a filing cabinet behind the desk Harry set to searching it .Like Filch s filing cabinets at Hogwarts it was full of folders each labeled with a name .It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search Mr Weasleys file .He pulled it out and opened it .ARTHUR WEASLEY BLOOD STATUS Pureblood but with unacceptable proMuggle leanings .Known member of the Order of the Phoenix .FAMILY Wife pureblood seven children two youngest at Hogwarts .NB Youngest son currently at home seriously ill Ministry inspectors have confirmed .SECURITY STATUS TRACKED .All movements are being monitored .Strong likelihood Undesirable No .1 will contact has stayed with Weasley family previously Undesirable Number One Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr Weasleys folder and shut the drawer .He had an idea he knew who that was and sure enough as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on the wall with the words undesirable no .1 emblazoned across his chest .A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner .Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written To be punished .Angrier than ever he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there .He gave the office one last sweeping look and his heart skipped a beat .Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror propped up on a bookcase beside the desk .Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up but realized the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all .Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book .Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest by Rita Skeeter bestselling author of Armando Dippet Master or Moron ?Harry opened the book at random and saw a fullpage photograph of two teenage boys both laughing immoderately with their arms around each others shoulders .Dumbledore now with elbowlength hair had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krums chin that had so annoyed Ron .The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful wild look about him .His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders .Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge but before he could check the caption the door of the office opened .If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself .As it was he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement because for a moment or two he remained quite still staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished .Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot .It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge .Very slowly hardly daring to breathe Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond .The pamphletmakers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked .Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said I bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms theyre so careless remember that poisonous duck ?Speeding back toward the lifts Harry reviewed his options .It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court .Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed and try again another day .The first thing to do was to find Ron and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom .The lift was empty when it arrived .Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent .To his enormous relief when it rattled to a halt at level two a soakingwet and wildeyed Ron got in .Mmorning he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again .Ron its me Harry !Harry !Blimey I forgot what you looked like why isnt Hermione with you ?She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge she couldnt refuse and But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again The doors opened and Mr Weasley walked inside talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill . .I quite understand what youre saying Wakanda but Im afraid I cannot be party to Mr Weasley broke off he had noticed Harry .It was very strange to have Mr Weasley glare at him with that much dislike .The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more .Oh hello Reg said Mr Weasley looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Rons robes .Isnt your wife in for questioning today ?Er whats happened to you ?Why are you so wet ?Yaxleys office is raining said Ron .He addressed Mr Weasleys shoulder and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each others eyes .I couldnt stop it so theyve sent me to get Bernie Pillsworth I think they said Yes a lot of offices have been raining lately said Mr Weasley .Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto ?It worked for Bletchley .Meteolojinx Recanto ?whispered Ron .No I didnt .Thanks D I mean thanks Arthur .The lift doors opened the old witch with the anthill hair left and Ron darted past her out of sight .Harry made to follow him but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift his nose buried in some papers he was reading .Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father .He glanced up saw Mr Weasley turned radish red and left the lift the moment the doors opened again .For the second time Harry tried to get out but this time found his way blocked by Mr Weasleys arm .One moment Runcorn .The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor Mr Weasley said I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell .Harry had the impression that Mr Weasleys anger was no less because of the brush with Percy .He decided his best chance was to act stupid .Sorry ?he said .Dont pretend Runcorn said Mr Weasley fiercely .You tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree didnt you ?I so what if I did ?said Harry .So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are said Mr Weasley quietly as the lift sank ever lower .And if he survives Azkaban you 11 have to answer to him not to mention his wife his sons and his friends Arthur Harry interrupted you know youre being tracked dont you ?Is that a threat Runcorn ?said Mr Weasley loudly .No said Harry its a fact !Theyre watching your every move The lift doors opened .They had reached the Atrium .Mr Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift .Harry stood there shaken .He wished he was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn .The lift doors clanged shut .Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on .He would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office .When the doors opened he stepped out into a torchlit stone passageway quite different from the wood paneled and carpeted corridors above .As the lift rattled away again Harry shivered slightly looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries .He set off his destination not the black door but the doorway he remembered on the lefthand side which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers .His mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door enter as Runcorn and ask for a quick word with Mafalda ?Of course he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this and even if he managed it Hermione s nonreappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry .Lost in thought he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him as if he were descending into fog .It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took a cold that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs .And then he felt that stealing sense of despair of hopelessness filling him expanding inside him .Dementors he thought .And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene .The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall black hooded figures their faces completely hidden their ragged breathing the only sound in the place .The petrified Muggleborns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches .Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors greedy mouths .Some were accompanied by families others sat alone .The dementors were gliding up and down in front of them and the cold and the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse .Fight it he told himself but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly .So he moved forward as silently as he could and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron who needed him .Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying The eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed and he felt sure that they sensed him sensed perhaps a human presence that still had some hope some resilience .And then abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it .No no Im halfblood Im halfblood I tell you !My father was a wizard he was look him up Arkie Alderton hes a wellknown broomstick designer look him up I tell you get your hands off me get your hands off This is your final warning said Umbridges soft voice magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the mans desperate screams .If you struggle you will be subjected to the Dementors Kiss .The mans screams subsided but dry sobs echoed through the corridor .Take him away said Umbridge .Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom their rotting scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting .They glided away down the corridor with him and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight .Next Mary Cattermole called Umbridge .A small woman stood up she was trembling from head to foot .Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long plain robes .Her face was completely bloodless .As she passed the dementors Harry saw her shudder .He did it instinctively without any sort of plan because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon As the door began to swing closed he slipped into the courtroom behind her .It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic .This one was much smaller though the ceiling was quite as high it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well .There were more dementors in here casting their freezing aura over the place they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform .Here behind a balustrade sat Umbridge with Yaxley on one side of her and Hermione quite as whitefaced as Mrs Cattermole on the other .At the foot of the platform a brightsilver longhaired cat prowled up and down up and down and Harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors That was for the accused to feel not the accusers .Sit down said Umbridge in her soft silky voice .Mrs Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform .The moment she had sat down chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there .You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole ?asked Umbridge .Mrs Cattermole gave a single shaky nod .Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department ?Mrs Cattermole burst into tears .I dont know where he is he was supposed to meet me here !Umbridge ignored her .Mother to Maisie Ellie and Alfred Cattermole ?Mrs Cattermole sobbed harder than ever .Theyre frightened they think I might not come home Spare us spat Yaxley .The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies .Mrs Cattermoles sobs masked Harrys footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform .The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled he felt the change in temperature It was warm and comfortable here .The Patronus he was sure was Umbridges and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here in her element upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write .Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge Yaxley and Hermione taking a seat behind the latter .He was worried about making Hermione jump .He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm .Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs Cattermole and Harry seized his chance .Im behind you he whispered into Hermiones ear .As he had expected she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs Cattermole and this went unnoticed .A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today Mrs Cattermole Umbridge was saying .Eightandthreequarter inches cherry unicornhair core .Do you recognize that description ?Mrs Cattermole nodded mopping her eyes on her sleeve .Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand ?Ttook ?sobbed Mrs Cattermole .I didnt ttake it from anybody .I bbought it when I was eleven years old .It it it chose me .She cried harder than ever .Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her .She leaned forward over the barrier the better to observe her victim and something gold swung forward too and dangled over the void the locket .Hermione had seen it she let out a little squeak but Umbridge and Yaxley still intent upon their prey were deaf to everything else .No said Umbridge no I dont think so Mrs Cattermole .Wands only choose witches or wizards .You are not a witch .I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here Mafalda pass them to me .Umbridge held out a small hand She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers .Hermione s hands were shaking with shock .She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs Cattermoles name on it .Thats thats pretty Dolores she said pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridges blouse .What ?snapped Umbridge glancing down .Oh yes an old family heirloom she said patting the locket lying on her large bosom .The S stands for Selwyn .I am related to the Selwyns .Indeed there are few pureblood families to whom I am not related .A pity she continued in a louder voice flicking through Mrs Cattermoles questionnaire that the same cannot be said for you . ‘Parents professions greengrocers .Yaxley laughed jeeringly .Below the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down and the dementors stood waiting in the corners .It was Umbridges lie that brought the blood surging into Harrys brain and obliterated his sense of caution that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pureblood credentials .He raised his wand not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak and said Stupefyl There was a flash of red light Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade Mrs Cattermoles papers slid off her lap onto the floor and down below the psilver cat vanished .Icecold air hit them like an oncoming wind Yaxley confused looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harrys disembodied hand and wand pointing at him .He tried to draw his own wand but too late Stupefyl Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor .Harry !Hermione if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend Harry Mrs Cattermole !Harry whirled around throwing off the Invisibility Cloak down below the dementors had moved out of their corners they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control they seemed to have abandoned restraint .Mrs Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back .EXPECTO PATRONUM The silver stag soared from the tip of Harrys wand and leaped toward the dementors which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again .The stags light more powerful and more warming than the cats protection filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around and around the room .Get the Horcrux Harry told Hermione .He ran back down the steps stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back into his bag and approached Mrs Cattermole .You ?she whispered gazing into his face .But but Reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning !Did I ?muttered Harry tugging at the chains binding her arms .Well Ive had a change of heart .Diffindol Nothing happened .Hermione how do I get rid of these chains ?Wait Im trying something up here Hermione were surrounded by dementors !I know that Harry but if she wakes up and the lockets gone I need to duplicate it Geminio There .That should fool her .Hermione came running downstairs .Lets see .Relashiol The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair .Mrs Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before .I dont understand she whispered .Youre going to leave here with us said Harry pulling her to her feet .Go home grab your children and get out get out of the country if youve got to .Disguise yourselves and run .Youve seen how it is you wont get anything like a fair hearing here .Harry said Hermione how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door ?Patronuses said Harry pointing his wand at his own The stag slowed and walked still gleaming brightly toward the door .As many as we can muster do yours Hermione .Expec Expecto patronum said Hermione .Nothing happened .Its the only spell she ever has trouble with Harry told a completely bemused Mrs Cattermole .Bit unfortunate really .Come on Hermione .Expecto patronum .A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione s wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag .Cmon said Harry and he led Hermione and Mrs Cattermole to the door .When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside .Harry looked around the dementors were falling back on both sides of them melding into the darkness scattering before the silver creatures .Its been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families Harry told the waiting Muggleborns who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly .Go abroad if you can .Just get well away from the Ministry .Thats the er new official position .Now if youll just follow the Patronuses youll be able to leave from the Atrium .They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings .If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag an otter soaring alongside it and twenty or so people half of them accused Muggleborns he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention .He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them .Reg !screamed Mrs Cattermole and she threw herself into Rons arms .Runcorn let me out he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley and hes told all of us to leave the country I think wed better do it Reg I really do lets hurry home and fetch the children and why are you so wet ?Water muttered Ron disengaging himself .Harry they know there are intruders inside the Ministry something about a hole in Umbridges office door I reckon weve got five minutes if that Hermione s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horrorstruck face to Harry .Harry if were trapped here !We wont be if we move fast said Harry .He addressed the silent group behind them who were all gawping at him .Whos got wands ?About half of them raised their hands .Okay all of you who havent got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has .Well need to be fast before they stop us .Come on .They managed to cram themselves into two lifts .Harrys Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise .Level eight said the witchs cool voice Atrium .Harry knew at once that they were in trouble .The Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace sealing them off .Harry !squeaked Hermione .What are we going to ?STOP !Harry thundered and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium The wizards sealing the fireplaces froze .Follow me he whispered to the group of terrified Muggleborns who moved forward in a huddle shepherded by Ron and Hermione .Whats up Albert ?said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier .He looked nervous .This lot need to leave before you seal the exits said Harry with all the authority he could muster .The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another .Weve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone Are you contradicting me ?Harry blustered .Would you like me to have your family tree examined like I had Dirk Cresswells ?Sorry !gasped the balding wizard backing away .I didnt mean nothing Albert but I thought .I thought they were in for questioning and .Their blood is pure said Harry and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall .Purer than many of yours I daresay .Off you go he boomed to the Muggleborns who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs .The Ministry wizards hung back some looking confused others scared and resentful .Then Mary !Mrs Cattermole looked over her shoulder .The real Reg Cattermole no longer vomiting but pale and wan had just come running out of a lift .RReg ?She looked from her husband to Ron who swore loudly .The balding wizard gaped his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other .Hey whats going on ?What is this ?Seal the exit !SEAL IT !Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces into which all of the Muggleborns but Mrs Cattermole had now vanished .As the balding wizard lifted his wand Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him sending him flying through the air .Hes been helping Muggleborns escape Yaxley !Harry shouted .The balding wizards colleagues set up an uproar under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs Cattermole pulled her into the stillopen fireplace and disappeared .Confused Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard while the real Reg Cattermole screamed My wife !Who was that with my wife ?Whats going on ?Harry saw Yaxleys head turn saw an inkling of the truth dawn in that brutish face .Come on !Harry shouted at Hermione he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxleys curse sailed over Harrys head .They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle .Harry flung open the door Ron was standing there beside the sinks still wrestling with Mrs Cattermole .Reg I dont understand Let go Im not your husband youve got to go home !There was a noise in the cubicle behind them Harry looked around Yaxley had just appeared .LETS GO !Harry yelled .He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot .Darkness engulfed them along with the sensation of compressing bands but something was wrong .Hermione s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip .He wondered whether he was going to suffocate he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Rons arm and Hermione s fingers which were slowly slipping away .And then he saw the door of number twelve Grimmauld Place with its serpent door knocker but before he could draw breath there was a scream and a flash of purple light Hermione s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again .THE THIEF Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green he had no idea what had happened he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs .Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him .Then an object twitched close to his face .He pushed himself onto his hands and knees ready to face some small fierce creature but saw that the object was Rons foot .Looking around Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor apparently alone .Harrys first thought was of the Forbidden Forest and for a moment even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrids hut .However in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest The trees looked younger they were more widely spaced the ground clearer .He met Hermione also on her hands and knees at Rons head .The moment his eyes fell upon Ron all other concerns fled Harrys mind for blood drenched the whole of Rons left side and his face stood out grayish white against the leafstrewn earth .The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left .Whats happened to him ?Splinched said Hermione her fingers already busy at Rons sleeve where the blood was wettest and darkest .Harry watched horrified as she tore open Rons shirt .He had always thought of Splinching as something comical but this .His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Rons upper arm where a great chunk of flesh was missing scooped cleanly away as though by a knife .Harry quickly in my bag theres a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany Bag right Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed seized the tiny beaded bag and thrust his hand inside it .At once object after object began presenting itself to his touch He felt the leather spines of books woolly sleeves of jumpers heels of shoes Quickly He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag .Accio Dittany A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron whose eyes were now halfclosed strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids .Hes fainted said Hermione who was also rather pale she no longer looked like Mafalda though her hair was still gray in places .Unstopper it for me Harry my hands are shaking .Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound .Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped .The wound now looked several days old new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh .Wow said Harry .Its all I feel safe doing said Hermione shakily .There are spells that would put him completely right but I darent try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage .Hes lost so much blood already .How did he get hurt ?I mean Harry shook his head trying to clear it to make sense of whatever had just taken place why are we here ?I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place ?Hermione took a deep breath .She looked close to tears .Harry I dont think were going to be able to go back there .What dyou ?As we Disapparated Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldnt get rid of him he was too strong and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place and then well I think he must have seen the door and thought we were stopping there so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead !But then wheres he ?Hang on .You dont mean hes at Grimmauld Place ?He cant get in there ?Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded .Harry I think he can .I I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx but Id already taken him inside the Fidelius Charms protection .Since Dumbledore died were SecretKeepers so Ive given him the secret havent I ?There was no pretending Harry was sure she was right .It was a serious blow .If Yaxley could now get inside the house there was no way that they could return .Even now he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition .Gloomy and oppressive though the house was it had been their one safe refuge even now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier a kind of home .With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food Harry imagined the houseelf busying himself over the steakandkidney pie that Harry Ron and Hermione would never eat .Harry Im sorry Im so sorry !Dont be stupid it wasnt your fault !If anything it was mine .Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad Eyes eye .Hermione recoiled looking horrified .Umbridge had stuck it to her office door to spy on people .I couldnt leave it there .but thats how they knew there were intruders .Before Hermione could answer Ron groaned and opened his eyes .He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat .How dyou feel ?Hermione whispered .Lousy croaked Ron wincing as he felt his injured arm .Where are we ?In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup said Hermione .I wanted somewhere enclosed undercover and this was the first place you thought of Harry finished for her glancing around at the apparently deserted glade .He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of how Death Eaters had found them within minutes .Had it been Legilimency ?Did Voldemort or his henchmen know even now where Hermione had taken them ?Dyou reckon we should move on ?Ron asked Harry and Harry could tell by the look on Rons face that he was thinking the same .I dunno .Ron still looked pale and clammy .He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so .The prospect of moving him was daunting .Lets stay here for now Harry said .Looking relieved Hermione sprang to her feet .Where are you going ?asked Ron .If were staying we should put some protective enchantments around the place she replied and raising her wand she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron murmuring incantations as she went .Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing .Salvio Hexia .Protego Totalum .Repello Muggletum .Muffliato .You could get out the tent Harry .Tent ?In the bag !In the .of course said Harry .He did not bother to grope inside it this time but used another Summoning Charm .The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas rope and poles .Harry recognized it partly because of the smell of cats as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup .I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry ?he asked starting to disentangle the tent pegs .Apparently he didnt want it back his lumbagos so bad said Hermione now performing complicated figureofeight movements with her wand so Rons dad said I could borrow it .ErectoV she added pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled fully constructed onto the ground before Harry out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope .Cave Inimicum Hermione finished with a skyward flourish .Thats as much as I can do .At the very least we should know theyre coming I cant guarantee it will keep out Vol Dont say the name !Ron cut across her his voice harsh .Harry and Hermione looked at each other .Im sorry Ron said moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them but it feels like a a jinx or something .Cant we call him YouKnowWho please ?Dumbledore said fear of a name began Harry .In case you hadnt noticed mate calling YouKnow Who by his name didnt do Dumbledore much good in the end Ron snapped back .Just just show You KnowWho some respect will you ?Respect ?Harry repeated but Hermione shot him a warning look apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition .Harry and Hermione half carried half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent .The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it a small flat complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen .He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed .Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while .Ill make some tea said Hermione breathlessly pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen .Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that MadEye had died it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest .After a minute or two Ron broke the silence .What dyou reckon happened to the Cattermoles ?With any luck theyll have got away said Hermione clutching her hot mug for comfort .As long as Mr Cattermole had his wits about him hell have transported Mrs Cattermole by SideAlong Apparition and theyll be fleeing the country right now with their children .Thats what Harry told her to do .Blimey I hope they escaped said Ron leaning back on his pillows .The tea seemed to be doing him good a little of his color had returned .I didnt get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quickwitted though the way everyone was talking to me when I was him .God I hope they made it .If they both end up in Azkaban because of us .Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask about whether Mrs Cattermole s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband died in his throat .Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him .So have you got it ?Harry asked her partly to remind her that he was there .Got got what ?she said with a little start .What did we just go through all that for ?The locket !Wheres the locket ?You got it ?shouted Ron raising himself a little higher on his pillows .No one tells me anything !Blimey you could have mentioned it !Well we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters werent we ?said Hermione .Here .And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron .It was as large as a chickens egg .An ornate letter S inlaid with many small green stones glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tents canvas roof .There isnt any chance someones destroyed it since Kreacher had it ?asked Ron hopefully .I mean are we sure its still a Horcrux ?I think so said Hermione taking it back from him and looking at it closely .There d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed .She passed it to Harry who turned it over in his fingers .The thing looked perfect pristine .He remembered the mangled remains of the diary and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it .I reckon Kreachers right said Harry .Were going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it .Sudden awareness of what he was holding of what lived behind the little golden doors hit Harry as he spoke .Even after all their efforts to find it he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him .Mastering himself again he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Reguluss bedroom door .Neither worked .He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione each of whom did their best but were no more successful at opening it than he had been .Can you feel it though ?Ron asked in a hushed voice as he held it tight in his clenched fist .What dyou mean ?Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry .After a moment or two Harry thought he knew what Ron meant .Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel or was it something beating inside the locket like a tiny metal heart ?What are we going to do with it ?Hermione asked .Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it Harry replied and little though he wanted to he hung the chain around his own neck dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him .I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent he added to Hermione standing up and stretching .And well need to think about some food as well .You stay there he added sharply as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green .With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout .However the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day and whether because of the protective enchantments and Mugglerepelling charms Hermione had spread around them or because people rarely ventured this way their patch of wood remained deserted apart from occasional birds and squirrels .Evening brought no change Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten oclock and looked out upon a deserted scene noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing .He felt hungry now and a little lightheaded .Hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan .After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away looking queasy Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione s feelings .The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready .His insides already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms tingled with unease .He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux but somehow he did not all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness of which his wand lit only a tiny part was worry about what would happen next .It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks months maybe even years but now he had come to an abrupt halt run out of road .There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be .He did not even know what all of them were .Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest .Curiously it had not taken heat from his body but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water .From time to time Harry thought or perhaps imagined that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own .Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark He tried to resist them push them away yet they came at him relentlessly .Neither can live while the other survives .Ron and Hermione now talking softly behind him in the tent could walk away if they wanted to He could not .And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left .Stupid idea he told himself dont think that .His scar was starting to prickle again .He was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts and tried to direct them into another channel .He thought of poor Kreacher who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead .Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew ?Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month that he would be loyal now but who knew what would happen ?What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf ?Sick images swarmed into Harrys head and he tried to push these away too for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him what if someone from the Ministry came too ?They could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione s sleeve .Harrys scar was burning now .He thought that there was so much they did not know Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined .Why hadnt Dumbledore explained more ?Had he thought that there would be time that he would live for years for centuries perhaps like his friend Nicolas Flamel ?If so he had been wrong .Snape had seen to that .Snape the sleeping snake who had struck at the top of the tower .And Dumbledore had fallen .fallen .Give it to me Gregorovitch .Harrys voice was high clear and cold his wand held in front of him by a longfingered white hand .The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair though there were no ropes holding him he swung there invisibly and eerily bound his limbs wrapped about him his terrified face on a level with Harrys ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head .He had purewhite hair and a thick bushy beard a trussedup Father Christmas .I have it not I have it no more !It was many years ago stolen from me !Do not lie to Lord Voldemort Gregorovitch .He knows .He always knows .The hanging mans pupils were wide dilated with fear and they seemed to swell bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch s wake as he held a lantern aloft Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light and there on the window ledge sat perched like a giant bird a young man with golden hair .In the split second that the lanterns light illuminated him Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter .And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch s face was stricken with terror .Who was the thief Gregorovitch ?said the high cold voice .I do not know I never knew a young man no please PLEASE !A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light Harryl He opened his eyes panting his forehead throbbing .He had passed out against the side of the tent had slid sideways down the canvas and was sprawled on the ground .He looked up at Hermione whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them .Dream he said sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione s glower with a look of innocence .Mustve dozed off sorry .I know it was your scar !I can tell by the look on your face !You were looking into Vol Dont say his name !came Rons angry voice from the depths of the tent .Fine retorted Hermione .YouKnowWhos mind then !I didnt mean it to happen !Harry said .It was a dream !Can you control what you dream about Hermione ?If you just learned to apply Occlumency But Harry was not interested in being told off he wanted to discuss what he had just seen .Hes found Gregorovitch Hermione and I think hes killed him but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch s mind and I saw I think Id better take over the watch if youre so tired youre falling asleep said Hermione coldly .I can finish the watch !No youre obviously exhausted .Go and lie down .She dropped down in the mouth of the tent looking stubborn .Angry but wishing to avoid a row Harry ducked back inside .Rons stillpale face was poking out from the lower bunk Harry climbed into the one above him lay down and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling .After several moments Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione huddled in the entrance .Whats YouKnowWho doing ?Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail then whispered into the darkness .He found Gregorovitch .He had him tied up he was torturing him .Hows Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if hes tied up ?I dunno .Its weird isnt it ?Harry closed his eyes thinking of all he had seen and heard .The more he recalled the less sense it made . .Voldemort had said nothing about Harrys wand nothing about the twin cores nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harrys .He wanted something from Gregorovitch Harry said eyes still closed tight .He asked him to hand it over but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him .and then .then .He remembered how he as Voldemort had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch s eyes into his memories .He read Gregorovitch s mind and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight .He stole it he stole whatever YouKnowWhos after .And I .I think Ive seen him somewhere .Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boys face .The theft had happened many years ago according to Gregorovitch .Why did the young thief look familiar ?The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent all Harry could hear was Rons breathing .After a while Ron whispered Couldnt you see what the thief was holding ?No .it mustve been something small .Harry ?The wooden slats of Rons bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed .Harry you dont reckon YouKnowWhos after something else to turn into a Horcrux ?I dont know said Harry slowly .Maybe .But wouldnt it be dangerous for him to make another one ?Didnt Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already ?Yeah but maybe he doesnt know that .Yeah .maybe said Harry .He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker .and yet he had killed him apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore .What was Voldemort trying to find ?Why with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet was he far away intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned and which had been stolen by the unknown thief ?Harry could still see the blondhaired youths face it was merry wild there was a Fred and Georgeish air of triumphant trickery about him .He had soared from the windowsill like a bird and Harry had seen him before but he could not think where .With Gregorovitch dead it was the merryfaced thief who was in danger now and it was on him that Harrys thoughts dwelled as Rons snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more .THE GOBLINS REVENGE Early next morning before the other two were awake Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest most gnarled and resilientlooking tree he could find .There in its shadow he buried MadEye Moodys eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand .It was not much but Harry felt that MadEye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridges door .Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake and discuss what they were going to do next .Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long and Ron agreed with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich .Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there .Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town .Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance .This however did not go as planned .He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill a descending mist and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood .But you can make a brilliant Patronus !protested Ron when Harry arrived back at the tent empty handed out of breath and mouthing the single word dementors .I couldnt .make one he panted clutching the stitch in his side .Wouldnt .come .Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed .It had been a nightmarish experience seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears that he was not going to be able to protect himself .It had taken all Harrys willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went .So we still havent got any food .Shut up Ron snapped Hermione .Harry what happened ?Why do you think you couldnt make your Patronus ?You managed perfectly yesterday !I dont know .He sat low in one of Perkinss old armchairs feeling more humiliated by the moment .He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him .Yesterday seemed a long time ago Today he might have been thirteen years old again the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express .Ron kicked a chair leg .What ?he snarled at Hermione .Im starving !All Ive had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools !You go and fight your way through the dementors then said Harry stung .I would but my arms in a sling in case you hadnt noticed !Thats convenient .And whats that supposed to ?Of course !cried Hermione clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence .Harry give me the locket !Come on she said impatiently clicking her fingers at him when he did not react the Horcrux Harry youre still wearing it !She held out her hands and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head .The moment it parted contact with Harrys skin he felt free and oddly light .He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted .Better ?asked Hermione .Yeah loads better !Harry she said crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick you dont think youve been possessed do you ?What ?No !he said defensively .I remember everything weve done while Ive been wearing it .I wouldnt know what Id done if Id been possessed would I ?Ginny told me there were times when she couldnt remember anything .Hmm said Hermione looking down at the heavy gold locket .Well maybe we ought not to wear it .We can just keep it in the tent .We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around Harry stated firmly .If we lose it if it gets stolen Oh all right all right said Hermione and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt .But well take turns wearing it so nobody keeps it on too long .Great said Ron irritably and now weve sorted that out can we please get some food ?Fine but well go somewhere else to find it said Hermione with half a glance at Harry .Theres no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around .In the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread .Its not stealing is it ?asked Hermione in a troubled voice as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast .Not if I left some money under the chicken coop ?Ron rolled his eyes and said with his cheeks bulging Ermynee oo worry oo much .Elax !And indeed it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night and Harry felt cheerful even hopeful as he took the first of the three night watches .This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits an empty one bickering and gloom .Harry was least surprised by this because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys .Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour .Ron however had always been used to three delicious meals a day courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts houseelves and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible .Whenever lack of food coincided with Rons turn to wear the Horcrux he became downright unpleasant .So where next ?was his constant refrain .He did not seem to have any ideas himself but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies .Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes and how to destroy the one they had already got their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information .As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him they kept reciting in a sort of dreary litany those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited .The orphanage where he had been born and raised Hogwarts where he had been educated Borgin and Burkes where he had worked after completing school then Albania where he had spent his years of exile These formed the basis of their speculations .Yeah lets go to Albania .Shouldnt take more than an afternoon to search an entire country said Ron sarcastically .There cant be anything there .Hed already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth said Hermione .We know the snakes not in Albania its usually with Vol Didnt I ask you to stop saying that ?Fine !The snake is usually with YouKnotuWho happy ?Not particularly .I cant see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes said Harry who had made this point many times before but said it again simply to break the nasty silence .Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects they wouldve recognized a Horcrux straightaway .Ron yawned pointedly .Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him Harry plowed on I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts .Hermione sighed .But Dumbledore would have found it Harry !Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory .Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwartss secrets .Im telling you if there was one place Vol Oi !YOUKNOWWHO then !Harry shouted goaded past endurance .If there was one place that was really important to YouKnowWho it was Hogwarts !Oh come on scoffed Ron .His school ?Yeah his school !It was his first real home the place that meant he was special it meant everything to him and even after he left This is YouKnowWho were talking about right ?Not you ?inquired Ron .He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him .You told us that YouKnowWho asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left said Hermione .Thats right said Harry .And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something probably another founders object to make into another Horcrux ?Yeah said Harry .But he didnt get the job did he ?said Hermione .So he never got the chance to find a founders object there and hide it in the school !Okay then said Harry defeated .Forget Hogwarts .Without any other leads they traveled into London and hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised .Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before .They visited its site and found a tower block of offices .We could try digging in the foundations ?Hermione suggested halfheartedly .He wouldnt have hidden a Horcrux here Harry said .He had known it all along The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape he would never have hidden a part of his soul there .Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts the Wizarding bank with its golden doors and marble floors .Even without any new ideas they continued to move through the countryside pitching the tent in a different place each night for security .Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot traveling by Apparition to more woods to the shadowy crevices of cliffs to purple moors gorsecovered mountainsides and once a sheltered and pebbly cove .Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse slowmotion game of passtheparcel where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety .Harrys scar kept prickling .It happened most often he noticed when he was wearing the Horcrux .Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain .What ?What did you see ?demanded Ron whenever he noticed Harry wince .A face muttered Harry every time .The same face .The thief who stole from Gregorovitch .And Ron would turn away making no effort to hide his disappointment .Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix but after all he Harry was not a television aerial he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time not tune in to whatever took his fancy .Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face whose name and whereabouts Harry felt sure Voldemort knew no better than he did .As Harrys scar continued to burn and the merry blondhaired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief .He could not entirely blame them when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes .As the days stretched into weeks Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without and about him .Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent and twice he came accidentally upon them huddled a little distance away heads together and talking fast both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water .Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course .Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership .In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts and as neither of the others thought this at all likely he stopped suggesting it .Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves .Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors wind and rain added to their troubles .The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation the lack of other peoples company or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort .My mother said Ron one night as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales can make good food appear out of thin air .He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate .Harry glanced automatically at Rons neck and saw as he had expected the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there .He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron whose attitude would he knew improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket .Your mother cant produce food out of thin air said Hermione .No one can .Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamps Law of Elemental Transfigur Oh speak English cant you ?Ron said prising a fish bone out from between his teeth .Its impossible to make good food out of nothing !You can Summon it if you know where it is you can transform it you can increase the quantity if youve already got some Well dont bother increasing this its disgusting said Ron .Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it !I notice Im always the one who ends up sorting out the food because Im a girl I suppose !No its because youre supposed to be the best at magic !shot back Ron .Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor .You can do the cooking tomorrow Ron you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating and Ill sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you Shut up !said Harry leaping to his feet and holding up both hands .Shut up now Hermione looked outraged .How can you side with him he hardly ever does the cook Hermione be quiet I can hear someone !He was listening hard his hands still raised warning them not to talk .Then over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them he heard voices again .He looked around at the Sneakoscope .It was not moving .You cast the Muffliato charm over us right ?he whispered to Hermione .I did everything she whispered back Muffliato MuggleRepelling and Disillusionment Charms all of it .They shouldnt be able to hear or see us whoever they are .Heavy scuffing and scraping noises plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering down the steep wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent .They drew their wands waiting .The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient in the near total darkness to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards .If these were Death Eaters then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time .The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank .Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure .Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance .Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice .There ought to be a few salmon in here or dyou reckon its too early in the season ?Accio Salmon .There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh .Somebody grunted appreciatively .Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard .It was a rough and unmelodious tongue a string of rattling guttural noises and there seemed to be two speakers one with a slightly lower slower voice than the other .A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas large shadows passed between tent and flames .The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction .Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates and the first man spoke again .Here Griphook Gornuk .Goblins Hermione mouthed at Harry who nodded .Thank you said the goblins together in English .So you three have been on the run how long ?asked a new mellow and pleasant voice it was vaguely familiar to Harry who pictured a roundbellied cheerfulfaced man .Six weeks .seven .I forget said the tired man .Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after .Nice to have a bit of company .There was a pause while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground .What made you leave Ted ?continued the man .Knew they were coming for me replied mellow voiced Ted and Harry suddenly knew who he was Tonkss father .Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided Id better run for it .Refused to register as a Muggleborn on principle see so I knew it was a matter of time knew Id have to leave in the end .My wife should be okay shes pureblood .And then I met Dean here what a few days ago son ?Yeah said another voice and Harry Ron and Hermione stared at each other silent but beside themselves with excitement sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas their fellow Gryffindor .Muggleborn eh ?asked the first man .Not sure said Dean .My dad left my mum when I was a kid .Ive got no proof he was a wizard though .There was silence for a while except for the sounds of munching then Ted spoke again .Ive got to say Dirk Im surprised to run into you .Pleased but surprised .Word was youd been caught .I was said Dirk .I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it Stunned Dawlish and nicked his broom .It was easier than youd think I dont reckon hes quite right at the moment .Might be Confunded .If so Id like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it probably saved my life .There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on .Then Ted said And where do you two fit in ?I er had the impression the goblins were for YouKnowWho on the whole .You had a false impression said the highervoiced of the goblins .We take no sides .This is a wizards war .How come youre in hiding then ?I deemed it prudent said the deepervoiced goblin .Having refused what I considered an impertinent request I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy .What did they ask you to do ?asked Ted .Duties illbefitting the dignity of my race replied the goblin his voice rougher and less human as he said it .I am not a houseelf .What about you Griphook ?Similar reasons said the highervoiced goblin .Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race .I recognize no Wizarding master .He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook and Gornuk laughed .Whats the joke ?asked Dean .He said replied Dirk that there are things wizards dont recognize either .There was a short pause .I dont get it said Dean .I had my small revenge before I left said Griphook in English .Good man goblin I should say amended Ted hastily .Didnt manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old highsecurity vaults I suppose ?If I had the sword would not have helped him break out replied Griphook .Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle .Dean and I are still missing something here said Ted .So is Severus Snape though he does not know it said Griphook and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter .Inside the tent Harrys breathing was shallow with excitement He and Hermione stared at each other listening as hard as they could .Didnt you hear about that Ted ?asked Dirk .About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindors sword out of Snape s office at Hogwarts ?An electric current seemed to course through Harry jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot .Never heard a word said Ted .Not in the Prophet was it ?Hardly chortled Dirk .Griphook here told me he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank .One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bills younger sister .Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines .She and a couple of friends got into Snape s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword .Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase .Ah God bless em said Ted .What did they think that theyd be able to use the sword on YouKnow Who ?Or on Snape himself ?Well whatever they thought they were going to do with it Snape decided the sword wasnt safe where it was said Dirk .Couple of days later once hed got the sayso from YouKnowWho I imagine he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead .The goblins started to laugh again .Im still not seeing the joke said Ted .Its a fake rasped Griphook .The sword of Gryffindor !Oh yes .It is a copy an excellent copy it is true but it was Wizardmade .The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblinmade armor possesses .Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank .I see said Ted .And I take it you didnt bother telling the Death Eaters this ?I saw no reason to trouble them with the information said Griphook smugly and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirks laughter .Inside the tent Harry closed his eyes willing someone to ask the question he needed answered and after a minute that seemed ten Dean obliged he was Harry remembered with a jolt an exboyfriend of Ginnys too .What happened to Ginny and the others ?The ones who tried to steal it ?Oh they were punished and cruelly said Griphook indifferently .Theyre okay though ?asked Ted quickly .I mean the Weasleys dont need any more of their kids injured do they ?They suffered no serious injury as far as I am aware said Griphook .Lucky for them said Ted .With Snapes track record I suppose we should just be glad theyre still alive .You believe that story then do you Ted ?asked Dirk .You believe Snape killed Dumbledore ?Course I do said Ted .Youre not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it ?Hard to know what to believe these days muttered Dirk .I know Harry Potter said Dean .And I reckon hes the real thing the Chosen One or whatever you want to call it .Yeah theres a lot would like to believe hes that son said Dirk me included .But where is he ?Run for it by the looks of things .Youd think if he knew anything we dont or had anything special going for him hed be out there now fighting rallying resistance instead of hiding .And you know the Prophet made a pretty good case against him The Prophet ?scoffed Ted .You deserve to be lied to if youre still reading that muck Dirk .You want the facts try the Quibbler .There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching plus a good deal of thumping by the sound of it Dirk had swallowed a fish bone .At last he spluttered The Quibbler ?That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegoods ?Its not so lunatic these days said Ted .You want to give it a look .Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophets ignoring not a single mention of Crumple Horned Snorkacks in the last issue .How long theyll let him get away with it mind I dont know .But Xeno says front page of every issue that any wizard whos against YouKnowWho ought to make helping Harry Potter their numberone priority .Hard to help a boy whos vanished off the face of the earth said Dirk .Listen the fact that they havent caught him yets one hell of an achievement said Ted .Id take tips from him gladly its what were trying to do stay free isnt it ?Yeah well youve got a point there said Dirk heavily .With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him Id have expected him to be caught by now .Mind whos to say they havent already caught and killed him without publicizing it ?Ah dont say that Dirk murmured Ted .There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks .When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope .Deciding the trees would give better cover they extinguished their fire then clambered back up the incline their voices fading away .Harry Ron and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears .Harry who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped now found himself unable to say more than Ginny the sword I know !said Hermione .She lunged for the tiny beaded bag this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit .Here .we .are .she said between gritted teeth and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag .Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight .Harry hurried to help her .As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermiones bag she kept her wand pointing at it ready to cast a spell at any moment .If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledores office she panted as they propped the painting against the side of the tent Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen he hangs right beside the case !Unless he was asleep said Harry but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas her wand directed at its center cleared her throat then said Er Phineas ?Phineas Nigellus ?Nothing happened .Phineas Nigellus ?said Hermione again .Professor Black ?Please could we talk to you ?Please ? ‘Please always helps said a cold snide voice and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait .At once Hermione cried Obscuro A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigelluss clever dark eyes causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain .What how dare what are you ?Im very sorry Professor Black said Hermione but its a necessary precaution !Remove this foul addition at once !Remove it I say !You are ruining a great work of art !Where am I ?What is going on ?Never mind where we are said Harry and Phineas Nigellus froze abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold .Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr Potter ?Maybe said Harry knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigelluss interest .Weve got a couple of questions to ask you about the sword of Gryffindor .Ah said Phineas Nigellus now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry yes .That silly girl acted most unwisely there Shut up about my sister said Ron roughly .Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows .Who else is here ?he asked turning his head from side to side .Your tone displeases me !The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme .Thieving from the headmaster !They werent thieving said Harry .That sword isnt Snapes .It belongs to Professor Snapes school said Phineas Nigellus .Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it ?She deserved her punishment as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity !Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity !said Hermione .Where am I ?repeated Phineas Nigellus starting to wrestle with the blindfold again .Where have you brought me ?Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears ?Never mind that !How did Snape punish Ginny Neville and Luna ?asked Harry urgently .Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest to do some work for the oaf Hagrid .Hagrids not an oaf !said Hermione shrilly .And Snape mightve thought that was a punishment said Harry but Ginny Neville and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid .The Forbidden Forest .theyve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest big deal !He felt relieved he had been imagining horrors the Cruciatus Curse at the very least .What we really wanted to know Professor Black is whether anyone else has um taken out the sword at all ?Maybe its been taken away for cleaning or or something ?Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered .Muggleborns he said .Goblinmade armor does not require cleaning simple girl .Goblins silver repels mundane dirt imbibing only that which strengthens it .Dont call Hermione simple said Harry .I grow weary of contradiction said Phineas Nigellus .Perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmasters office ?Still blindfolded he began groping the side of his frame trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts .Harry had a sudden inspiration .Dumbledore !Cant you bring us Dumbledore ?I beg your pardon ?asked Phineas Nigellus .Professor Dumbledores portrait couldnt you bring him along here into yours ?Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harrys voice .Evidently it is not only Muggleborns who are ignorant Potter .The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere .Dumbledore cannot come here with me and after the treatment I have received at your hands I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit !Slightly crestfallen Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame .Professor Black said Hermione couldnt you just tell us please when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case ?Before Ginny took it out I mean ?Phineas snorted impatiently .I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring .Hermione whipped around to look at Harry .Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus who had at last managed to locate the exit .Well good night to you he said a little waspishly and he began to move out of sight again .Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout .Wait !Have you told Snape you saw this ?Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture .Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore .Goodbye Potter !And with that he vanished completely leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop .Harry !Hermione cried .I know !Harry shouted .Unable to contain himself he punched the air it was more than he had dared to hope for .He strode up and down the tent feeling that he could have run a mile he did not even feel hungry anymore .Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigelluss portrait back into the beaded bag when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry .The sword can destroy Horcruxes !Goblinmade blades imbibe only that which strengthen them Harry that swords impregnated with basilisk venom !And Dumbledore didnt give it to me because he still needed it he wanted to use it on the locket and he must have realized they wouldnt let you have it if he put it in his will so he made a copy and put a fake in the glass case and he left the real one where ?They gazed at each other Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them tantalizingly close .Why hadnt Dumbledore told him ?Or had he in fact told Harry but Harry had not realized it at the time ?Think !whispered Hermione .Think !Where would he have left it ?Not at Hogwarts said Harry resuming his pacing .Somewhere in Hogsmeade ?suggested Hermione .The Shrieking Shack ?said Harry .Nobody ever goes in there .But Snape knows how to get in wouldnt that be a bit risky ?Dumbledore trusted Snape Harry reminded her .Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords said Hermione .Yeah youre right !said Harry and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations however faint about Snape s trustworthiness .So would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade then ?What dyou reckon Ron ?Ron ?Harry looked around .For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk looking stony .Oh remembered me have you ?he said .What ?Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk .You two carry on .Dont let me spoil your fun .Perplexed Harry looked to Hermione for help but she shook her head apparently as nonplussed as he was .Whats the problem ?asked Harry .Problem ?Theres no problem said Ron still refusing to look at Harry .Not according to you anyway .There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads .It had started to rain .Well youve obviously got a problem said Harry .Spit it out will you ?Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up .He looked mean unlike himself .All right Ill spit it out .Dont expect me to skip up and down the tent because theres some other damn thing weve got to find .Just add it to the list of stuff you dont know .I dont know ?repeated Harry I dont know ?Plunk plunk plunk .The rain was falling harder and heavier it pattered on the leafstrewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark .Dread doused Harrys jubilation Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking .Its not like Im not having the time of my life here said Ron you know with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night .I just hoped you know after wed been running round a few weeks wed have achieved something .Ron Hermione said but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent .I thought you knew what youd signed up for said Harry .Yeah I thought I did too .So what part of it isnt living up to your expectations ?asked Harry .Anger was coming to his defense now .Did you think wed be staying in five star hotels ?Finding a Horcrux every other day ?Did you think youd be back to Mummy by Christmas ?We thought you knew what you were doing !shouted Ron standing up and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives .We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan !Ron !said Hermione this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof but again he ignored her .Well sorry to let you down said Harry his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow inadequate .Ive been straight with you from the start I told you everything Dumbledore told me .And in case you havent noticed weve found one Horcrux Yeah and were about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them nowhere effing near in other words !Take off the locket Ron Hermione said her voice unusually high .Please take it off .You wouldnt be talking like this if you hadnt been wearing it all day .Yeah he would said Harry who did not want excuses made for Ron .Dyou think I havent noticed the two of you whispering behind my back ?Dyou think I didnt guess you were thinking this stuff ?Harry we werent Dont lie !Ron hurled at her .You said it too you said you were disappointed you said youd thought he had a bit more to go on than I didnt say it like that Harry I didnt !she cried .The rain was pounding the tent tears were pouring down Hermiones face and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been a shortlived firework that had flared and died leaving everything dark wet and cold .The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not yet to be dead .So why are you still here ?Harry asked Ron .Search me said Ron .Go home then said Harry .Yeah maybe I will !shouted Ron and he took several steps toward Harry who did not back away .Didnt you hear what they said about my sister ?But you dont give a rats fart do you its only the Forbidden Forest Harry IveFacedWorse Potter doesnt care what happens to her in here well I do all right giant spiders and mental stuff I was only saying she was with the others they were with Hagrid Yeah I get it you dont care !And what about the rest of my family ‘the Weasleys dont need another kid injured did you hear that ?Yeah I Not bothered what it meant though ?Ron !said Hermione forcing her way between them .I dont think it means anything new has happened anything we dont know about think Ron Bills already scarred plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now and youre supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit Im sure thats all he meant Oh youre sure are you ?Right then well I wont bother myself about them .Its all right for you two isnt it with your parents safely out of the way My parents are dead .Harry bellowed .And mine could be going the same way !yelled Ron .Then GO !roared Harry .Go back to them pretend youve got over your spattergroit and Mummyll be able to feed you up and Ron made a sudden movement Harry reacted but before either wand was clear of its owners pocket Hermione had raised her own .Protego she cried and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time .Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron Something had broken between them .Leave the Horcrux Harry said .Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair .He turned to Hermione .What are you doing ?What do you mean ?Are you staying or what ?I .She looked anguished .Yes yes Im staying .Ron we said wed go with Harry we said wed help I get it .You choose him .Ron no please come back come back !She was impeded by her own Shield Charm by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night .Harry stood quite still and silent listening to her sobbing and calling Rons name amongst the trees .After a few minutes she returned her sopping hair plastered to her face .Hes gggone !Disapparated !She threw herself into a chair curled up and started to cry .Harry felt dazed .He stooped picked up the Horcrux and placed it around his own neck .He dragged blankets off Rons bunk and threw them over Hermione .Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof listening to the pounding of the rain .GODRICS HOLLOW When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened .Then he hoped childishly that it had been a dream that Ron was still there and had never left .Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Rons deserted bunk .It was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes .Harry jumped down from his own bed keeping his eyes averted from Rons .Hermione who was already busy in the kitchen did not wish Harry good morning but turned her face away quickly as he went by .Hes gone Harry told himself .Hes gone .He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it .Hes gone and hes not coming back .And that was the simple truth of it Harry knew because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible once they vacated this spot for Ron to find them again .He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence .Hermione s eyes were puffy and red she looked as if she had not slept .They packed up their things Hermione dawdling .Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain but no redhaired figure appeared between the trees .Every time Harry imitated her looked around for he could not help hoping a little himself and saw nothing but rainswept woods another little parcel of fury exploded inside him .He could hear Ron saying We thought you knew what you were doing and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach .The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank .They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite .Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated reappearing on a windswept heathercovered hillside .The instant they arrived Hermione dropped Harrys hand and walked away from him finally sitting down on a large rock her face on her knees shaking with what he knew were sobs .He watched her supposing that he ought to go and comfort her but something kept him rooted to the spot .Everything inside him felt cold and tight Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Rons face .Harry strode off through the heather walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection .They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days .Harry was determined never to mention his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping he would hear her crying .Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauders Map and examining it by wandlight .He was waiting for the moment when Rons labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle protected by his status of pureblood .However Ron did not appear on the map and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginnys name in the girls dormitory wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep that she would somehow know he was thinking about her hoping that she was all right .By day they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindors sword but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it the more desperate and farfetched their speculation became .Cudgel his brains though he might Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something .There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore .We thought you knew what you were doing .We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do .We thought you had a real plan He could not hide it from himself Ron had been right .Dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing .They had discovered one Horcrux but they had no means of destroying it The others were as unattainable as they had ever been .Hopelessness threatened to engulf him .He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends offers to accompany him on this meandering pointless journey .He knew nothing he had no ideas and he was constantly painfully on the alert for any indication that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough that she was leaving .They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigelluss portrait and propping it up in a chair as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Rons departure .Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to and consented to reappear blindfolded every few days or so .Harry was even glad to see him because he was company albeit of a snide and taunting kind .They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer .He venerated Snape the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting .However he did let drop certain snippets .Snape seemed to be facing a constant low level of mutiny from a hard core of students .Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade .Snape had reinstated Umbridges old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies .From all of these things Harry deduced that Ginny and probably Neville and Luna along with her had been doing their best to continue Dumbledores Army .This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache but it also made him think of Ron again and of Dumbledore and of Hogwarts itself which he missed nearly as much as his exgirlfriend .Indeed as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape s crackdown Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snapes regime Being fed and having a soft bed and other people being in charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment .But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One that there was a tenthousandGalleon price on his head and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic .Indeed Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry and Hermiones whereabouts .Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious goodbyes .The weather grew colder and colder .They did not dare remain in any one area too long so rather than staying in the south of England where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries they continued to meander up and down the country braving a mountainside where sleet pounded the tent a wide flat marsh where the tent was flooded with chill water and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch where snow half buried the tent in the night .They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest again what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them .They had just eaten an unusually good meal Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears .He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours break from wearing the Horcrux which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him .Hermione ?Hmm ?She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard .He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book which was not after all very long but evidently she was still deciphering something in it because Spellmans Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair .Harry cleared his throat .He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion several years previously when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip .Hermione Ive been thinking and Harry could you help me with something ?Apparently she had not been listening to him .She leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard .Look at that symbol she said pointing to the top of a page .Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story being unable to read runes he could not be sure there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye its pupil crossed with a vertical line .I never took Ancient Runes Hermione .I know that but it isnt a rune and its not in the syllabary either .All along I thought it was a picture of an eye but I dont think it is !Its been inked in look somebodys drawn it there it isnt really part of the book .Think have you ever seen it before ?No .No wait a moment .Harry looked closer .Isnt it the same symbol Lunas dad was wearing round his neck ?Well thats what I thought too !Then its Grindelwalds mark .She stared at him openmouthed .What ?Krum told me .He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding .Hermione looked astonished .Grindelwalds mark ?She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again .Ive never heard that Grindelwald had a mark .Theres no mention of it in anything Ive ever read about him .Well like I say Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang and Grindelwald put it there .She fell back into the old armchair frowning .Thats very odd .If its a symbol of Dark Magic whats it doing in a book of childrens stories ?Yeah it is weird said Harry .And youd think Scrimgeour would have recognized it .He was Minister he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff .I know .Perhaps he thought it was an eye just like I did .All the other stories have little pictures over the titles .She did not speak but continued to pore over the strange mark .Harry tried again .Hermione ?Hmm ?Ive been thinking .I I want to go to Godrics Hollow .She looked up at him but her eyes were unfocused and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book .Yes she said .Yes Ive been wondering that too .I really think well have to .Did you hear me right ?he asked .Of course I did .You want to go to Godrics Hollow .I agree I think we should .I mean I cant think of anywhere else it could be either .Itll be dangerous but the more I think about it the more likely it seems its there .Er whats there ?asked Harry .At that she looked just as bewildered as he felt .Well the sword Harry !Dumbledore must have known youd want to go back there and I mean Godrics Hollow is Godric Gryffindors birthplace Really ?Gryffindor came from Godrics Hollow ?Harry did you ever even open A History of Magic ?Erm he said smiling for what felt like the first time in months The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff .I mightve opened it you know when I bought it .just the once .Well as the village is named after him Id have thought you might have made the connection said Hermione .She sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library .Theres a bit about the village in A History of Magic wait .She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted . ‘Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689 wizards went into hiding for good .It was natural perhaps that they formed their own small communities within a community .Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families who banded together for mutual support and protection .The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall Upper Flagley in Yorkshire and Ottery St .Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles .Most celebrated of these halfmagical dwelling places is perhaps Godrics Hollow the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born and where Bowman Wright Wizarding smith forged the first Golden Snitch .The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families and this accounts no doubt for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries .You and your parents arent mentioned Hermione said closing the book because Professor Bagshot doesnt cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century .But you see ?Godrics Hollow Godric Gryffindor Gryffindors sword dont you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection ?Oh yeah .Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godrics Hollow .For him the lure of the village lay in his parents graves the house where he had narrowly escaped death and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot .Remember what Muriel said ?he asked eventually .Who ?You know he hesitated He did not want to say Rons name .Ginnys greataunt .At the wedding .The one who said you had skinny ankles .Oh said Hermione .It was a sticky moment Harry knew that she had sensed Rons name in the offing .He rushed on She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godrics Hollow .Bathilda Bagshot murmured Hermione running her index finger over Bathildas embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic .Well I suppose She gasped so dramatically that Harrys insides turned over he drew his wand looking around at the entrance half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap but there was nothing there .What ?he said half angry half relieved .What did you do that for ?I thought youd seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent at least Harry what if Bathilda s got the sword ?What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her ?Harry considered this possibility .Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now and according to Muriel she was gaga .Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her ?If so Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda .Now however was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermiones theory not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with Harrys dearest wish .Yeah he might have done !So are we going to go to Godrics Hollow ?Yes but well have to think it through carefully Harry .She was sitting up now and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his .Well need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion ?In that case well need to collect hair from somebody .I actually think wed better do that Harry the thicker our disguises the better .Harry let her talk nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause but his mind had left the conversation .For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake he felt excited .He was about to go home about to return to the place where he had had a family .It was in Godrics Hollow that but for Voldemort he would have grown up and spent every school holiday .He could have invited friends to his house .He might even have had brothers and sisters .It would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake .The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him .After Hermione had gone to bed that night Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione s beaded bag and from inside it the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago .For the first time in months he perused the old pictures of his parents smiling and waving up at him from the images which were all he had left of them now .Harry would gladly have set out for Godrics Hollow the following day but Hermione had other ideas .Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents deaths she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible .It was therefore a full week later once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together that Hermione agreed to make the journey .They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion Harry transforming into a balding middleaged Muggle man Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife .The beaded bag containing all of their possessions apart from the Horcrux which Harry was wearing around his neck was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione s buttonedup coat .Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again .Heart beating in his throat Harry opened his eyes .They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the nights first stars were already glimmering feebly .Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows .A short way ahead of them a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village .All this snow !Hermione whispered beneath the cloak .Why didnt we think of snow ?After all our precautions well leave prints !Well just have to get rid of them you go in front Ill do it Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces .Lets take off the Cloak said Harry and when she looked frightened Oh come on we dont look like us and theres no one around .He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages Any one of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now .Harry gazed at the front doors their snowburdened roofs and their front porches wondering whether he remembered any of them knowing deep inside that it was impossible that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever .He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died .Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village a small square was revealed to them .Strung all around with colored lights there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree .There were several shops a post office a pub and a little church whose stainedglass windows were glowing jewel bright across the square .The snow here had become impacted It was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day .Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps .They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed then they heard a carol start up inside the little church .Harry I think its Christmas Eve !said Hermione .Is it ?He had lost track of the date they had not seen a newspaper for weeks .Im sure it is said Hermione her eyes upon the church .They .theyll be in there wont they ?Your mum and dad ?I can see the graveyard behind it .Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement more like fear .Now that he was so near he wondered whether he wanted to see after all .Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time pulling him forward .Halfway across the square however she stopped dead .Harry look !She was pointing at the war memorial .As they had passed it it had transformed .Instead of an obelisk covered in names there was a statue of three people a man with untidy hair and glasses a woman with long hair and a kind pretty face and a baby boy sitting in his mothers arms .Snow lay upon all their heads like fluffy white caps .Harry drew closer gazing up into his parents faces .He had never imagined that there would be a statue . .How strange it was to see himself represented in stone a happy baby without a scar on his forehead .Cmon said Harry when he had looked his fill and they turned again toward the church .As they crossed the road he glanced over his shoulder the statue had turned back into the war memorial .The singing grew louder as they approached the church .It made Harrys throat constrict it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor of the Great Halls twelve Christmas trees of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker of Ron in a handknitted sweater .There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard .Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it .On either side of the slippery path to the church doors the snow lay deep and untouched .They moved off through the snow carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows .Behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red gold and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow .Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket Harry moved toward the nearest grave .Look at this its an Abbott could be some longlost relation of Hannahs !Keep your voice down Hermione begged him .They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them stooping to peer at the words on old headstones every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied .Harry here !Hermione was two rows of tombstones away he had to wade back to her his heart positively banging in his chest .Is it ?No but look !She pointed to the dark stone .Harry stooped down and saw upon the frozen lichenspotted granite the words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and a short way below her dates of birth and death AND HER DAUGHTER ARIANA .There was also a quotation Where your treasure is there will your heart be also .So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right .The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here and part of it had died here .Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it .Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so yet he had never thought to share the connection .They could have visited the place together for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore of what a bond that would have been of how much it would have meant to him .But it seemed that to Dumbledore the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence irrelevant perhaps to the job he wanted Harry to do .Hermione was looking at Harry and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow .He read the words on the tombstone again .Where your treasure is there will your heart be also .He did not understand what these words meant .Surely Dumbledore had chosen them as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died .Are you sure he never mentioned ?Hermione began .No said Harry curtly then lets keep looking and he turned away wishing he had not seen the stone He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment .Here !cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness .Oh no sorry !I thought it said Potter .She was rubbing at a crumbling mossy stone gazing down at it a little frown on her face .Harry come back a moment .He did not want to be sidetracked again and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her .What ?Look at this !The grave was extremely old weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the name .Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it .Harry thats the mark in the book !He peered at the place she indicated The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name .Yeah .it could be .Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone .It says Ig Ignotus I think .Im going to keep looking for my parents all right ?Harry told her a slight edge to his voice and he set off again leaving her crouched beside the old grave .Every now and then he recognized a surname that like Abbott he had met at Hogwarts .Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out or the current members had moved away from Godrics Hollow .Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation .The darkness and the silence seemed to become all of a sudden much deeper .Harry looked around worried thinking of dementors then realized that the carols had finished that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square .Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights .Then Hermiones voice came out of the blackness for the third time sharp and clear from a few yards away .Harry theyre here .right here .And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time He moved toward her feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs .The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Arianas .It was made of white marble just like Dumbledores tomb and this made it easy to read as it seemed to shine in the dark .Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it .JAMES POTTER BORN 27 MARCH 1960 LILY POTTER BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .Harry read the words slowly as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning and he read the last of them aloud .The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .A horrible thought came to him and with it a kind of panic .Isnt that a Death Eater idea ?Why is that there ?It doesnt mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it Harry said Hermione her voice gentle .It means .you know .living beyond death .Living after death .But they were not living thought Harry They were gone .The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone indifferent unknowing .And tears came before he could stop them boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending ?He let them fall his lips pressed hard together looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay bones now surely or dust not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near his heart still beating alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing at this moment that he was sleeping under the snow with them .Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly .He could not look at her but returned the pressure now taking deep sharp gulps of the night air trying to steady himself trying to regain control .He should have brought something to give them and he had not thought of it and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen .But Hermione raised her wand moved it in a circle through the air and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them .Harry caught it and laid it on his parents grave .As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave He did not think he could stand another moment there .He put his arm around Hermiones shoulders and she put hers around his waist and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow past Dumbledores mother and sister back toward the dark church and the outofsight kissing gate .BATHILDAS SECRET Harry stop .Whats wrong ?They had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott .Theres someone there .Someone watching us .I can tell .There over by the bushes .They stood quite still holding on to each other gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard .Harry could not see anything .Are you sure ?I saw something move I could have sworn I did .She broke from him to free her wand arm .We look like Muggles Harry pointed out .Muggles who ve just been laying flowers on your parents grave !Harry Im sure theres someone over there !Harry thought of A History of Magic the graveyard was supposed to be haunted what if ?But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed .Ghosts could not move snow .Its a cat said Harry after a second or two or a bird .If it was a Death Eater wed be dead by now .But lets get out of here and we can put the Cloak back on .They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard .Harry who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement .They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves .The pub was fuller than before Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church .For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it but before he could say anything Hermione murmured Lets go this way and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered .Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again .They walked as quickly as they dared past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains .How are we going to find Bathildas house ?asked Hermione who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder .Harry ?What do you think ?Harry ?She tugged at his arm but Harry was not paying attention .He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses .Next moment he had sped up dragging Hermione along with him she slipped a little on the ice .Harry Look .Look at it Hermione .I dont .oh !He could see it the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily .The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waisthigh grass .Most of the cottage was still standing though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart that Harry was sure was where the curse had backfired .He and Hermione stood at the gate gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it .I wonder why nobodys ever rebuilt it ?whispered Hermione .Maybe you cant rebuild it ?Harry replied .Maybe its like the injuries from Dark Magic and you cant repair the damage ?He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate not wishing to open it but simply to hold some part of the house .Youre not going to go inside ?It looks unsafe it might oh Harry look !His touch on the gate seemed to have done it .A sign had risen out of the ground in front of them up through the tangles of nettles and weeds like some bizarre fastgrowing flower and in golden letters upon the wood it said On this spot on the night of 31 October 1 981 Lily and James Potter lost their lives .Their son Harry remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse .This house invisible to Muggles has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family .And all around these neatly lettered words scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped .Some had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink others had carved their initials into the wood still others had left messages .The most recent of these shining brightly over sixteen years worth of magical graffiti all said similar things .Good luck Harry wherever you are .If you read this Harry were all behind you !Long live Harry Potter .They shouldnt have written on the sign !said Hermione indignant .But Harry beamed at her .Its brilliant .Im glad they did .I .He broke off .A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square .Harry thought though it was hard to judge that the figure was a woman .She was moving slowly possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground .Her stoop her stoutness her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age .They watched in silence as she drew nearer .Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing but he knew instinctively that she would not .At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road facing them .He did not need Hermiones pinch to his arm .There was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her if she was not a witch .Even assuming that she was a witch however it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold simply to look at an old ruin .By all the rules of normal magic meanwhile she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all .Nevertheless Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there and also who they were .Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion she raised a gloved hand and beckoned .Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak her arm pressed against his .How does she know ?He shook his head .The woman beckoned again more vigorously .Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street .Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months ?That Dumbledore had told her to wait and that Harry would come in the end ?Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot ?Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledoreish power that he had never encountered before .Finally Harry spoke causing Hermione to gasp and jump .Are you Bathilda ?The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again .Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other .Harry raised his eyebrows Hermione gave a tiny nervous nod .They stepped toward the woman and at once she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come .Leading them past several houses she turned in at a gate .They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left .She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door then opened it and stepped back to let them pass .She smelled bad or perhaps it was her house Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak .Now that he was beside her he realized how tiny she was bowed down with age she came barely level with his chest .She closed the door behind them her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint then turned and peered into Harrys face .Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots .He wondered whether she could make him out at all even if she could it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see .The odor of old age of dust of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a motheaten black shawl revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly .Bathilda ?Harry repeated .She nodded again .Harry became aware of the locket against his skin the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold .Did it know could it sense that the thing that would destroy it was near ?Bathilda shuffled past them pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room .Harry Im not sure about this breathed Hermione .Look at the size of her I think we could overpower her if we had to said Harry .Listen I should have told you I knew she wasnt all there .Muriel called her ‘gaga .Come !called Bathilda from the next room .Hermione jumped and clutched Harrys arm .Its okay said Harry reassuringly and he led the way into the sitting room .Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles but it was still very dark not to mention extremely dirty .Thick dust crunched beneath their feet and Harrys nose detected underneath the dank and mildewed smell something worse like meat gone bad .He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathildas house to check whether she was coping .She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic too for she lit the candles clumsily by hand her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire .Let me do that offered Harry and he took the matches from her .She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups .The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bowfronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs .When the flame danced into life its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver .He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures .As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire he muttered Tergeo The dust vanished from the photographs and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames .He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them .Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye and he snatched it up .It was the goldenhaired merryfaced thief the young man who had perched on Gregorovitchs windowsill smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame .And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore and that must be where all the missing photographs were in Ritas book .Mrs Miss Bagshot ?he said and his voice shook slightly .Who is this ?Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her .Miss Bagshot ?Harry repeated and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace .Bathilda looked up at his voice and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest .Who is this person ?Harry asked her pushing the picture forward .She peered at it solemnly then up at Harry .Do you know who this is ?he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual .This man ?Do you know him ?Whats he called ?Bathilda merely looked vague .Harry felt an awful frustration .How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathildas memories ?Who is this man ?he repeated loudly .Harry what are you doing ?asked Hermione .This picture Hermione its the thief the thief who stole from Gregorovitch !Please !he said to Bathilda .Who is this ?But she only stared at him .Why did you ask us to come with you Mrs Miss Bagshot ?asked Hermione raising her own voice .Was there something you wanted to tell us ?Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry .With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall .You want us to leave ?he asked .She repeated the gesture this time pointing firstly at him then at herself then at the ceiling .Oh right .Hermione I think she wants me to go upstairs with her .All right said Hermione lets go .But when Hermione moved Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor once more pointing first at Harry then to herself .She wants me to go with her alone .Why ?asked Hermione and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise .Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me and only to me ?Do you really think she knows who you are ?Yes said Harry looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own I think she does .Well okay then but be quick Harry .Lead the way Harry told Bathilda .She seemed to understand because she shuffled around him toward the door .Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile but he was not sure she had seen it she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor looking toward the bookcase .As Harry walked out of the room unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda he slipped the silver framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket .The stairs were steep and narrow Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathildas backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him which seemed only too likely .Slowly wheezing a little she climbed to the upper landing turned immediately right and led him into a lowceilinged bedroom .It was pitchblack and smelled horrible Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness .Lumos said Harry and his wand ignited .He gave a start Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness and he had not heard her approach .You are Potter ?she whispered .Yes I am .She nodded slowly solemnly .Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast faster than his own heart It was an unpleasant agitating sensation .Have you got anything for me ?Harry asked but she seemed distracted by his lit wandtip .Have you got anything for me ?he repeated .Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once Harrys scar prickled painfully the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved the dark fetid room dissolved momentarily .He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high cold voice Hold him .Harry swayed where he stood The dark foulsmelling room seemed to close around him again he did not know what had just happened .Have you got anything for me ?he asked for a third time much louder .Over here she whispered pointing to the corner .Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window .This time she did not lead him .Harry edged between her and the unmade bed his wand raised .He did not want to look away from her .What is it ?he asked as he reached the dressing table which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry .There she said pointing at the shapeless mass .And in the instant that he looked away his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt a ruby she moved weirdly He saw it out of the corner of his eye panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been .The snake struck as he raised his wand The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him He fell backward onto the dressing table into the mound of filthy clothing He rolled sideways narrowly avoiding the snakes tail which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor .From below he heard Hermione call Harry ?He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back Then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him powerful muscular No !he gasped pinned to the floor .Yes whispered the voice .Yesss .hold you .hold you .Accio .Accio Wand .But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso squeezing the air from him pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest a circle of ice that throbbed with life inches from his own frantic heart and his brain was flooding with cold white light all thought obliterated his own breath drowned distant footsteps everything going .A metal heart was banging outside his chest and now he was flying flying with triumph in his heart without need of broomstick or thestral .He was abruptly awake in the soursmelling darkness Nagini had released him .He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light It struck and Hermione dived aside with a shriek her deflected curse hit the curtained window which shattered .Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencillike something his wand He bent and snatched it up but now the room was full of the snake its tail thrashing Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light and the snake flew into the air smacking Harry hard in the face as it went coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling .Harry raised his wand but as he did so his scar seared more painfully more powerfully than it had done in years .Hes coming !Hermione hes comingl As he yelled the snake fell hissing wildly .Everything was chaos It smashed shelves from the wall and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed The snake reared again but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming was perhaps already at the gate his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar The snake lunged as he took a running leap dragging Hermione with him as it struck Hermione screamed ConfringoV and her spell flew around the room exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them bouncing from floor to ceiling Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand .Glass cut his cheek as pulling Hermione with him he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair .And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish and he screamed with rage a scream that mingled with the girls that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day .And his scream was Harrys scream his pain was Harrys pain .that it could happen here where it had happened before .here within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die .to die .The pain was so terrible .ripped from his body .But if he had no body why did his head hurt so badly if he was dead how could he feel so unbearably didnt pain cease with death didnt it go .The night wet and windy two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the shop windows covered in paper spiders all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe .And he was gliding along that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions .Not anger .that was for weaker souls than he .but triumph yes .He had waited for this he had hoped for it .Nice costume mister !He saw the small boys smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak saw the fear cloud his painted face Then the child turned and ran away .Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand .One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother .but unnecessary quite unnecessary .And along a new and darker street he moved and now his destination was in sight at last the Fidelius Charm broken though they did not know it yet .And he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge and stared over it .They had not drawn the curtains he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room the tall blackhaired man in his glasses making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small blackhaired boy in his blue pajamas .The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke to grab it in his small fist .A door opened and the mother entered saying words he could not hear her long darkred hair falling over her face .Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother .He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched yawning .The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open but James Potter did not hear .His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door which burst open .He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall .It was easy too easy he had not even picked up his wand .Lily take Harry and go !Its him !Go !Run !Ill hold him off !Hold him off without a wand in his hand ! .He laughed before casting the curse .Avada Kedavra !The green light filled the cramped hallway it lit the pram pushed against the wall it made the banisters glare like lightning rods and James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut .He could hear her screaming from the upper floor trapped but as long as she was sensible she at least had nothing to fear .He climbed the steps listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in .She had no wand upon her either .How stupid they were and how trusting thinking that their safety lay in friends that weapons could be discarded even for moments .He forced the door open cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand .and there she stood the child in her arms .At the sight of him she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide as if this would help as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead .Not Harry not Harry please not Harry !Stand aside you silly girl .stand aside now .Not Harry please no take me kill me instead This is my last warning Not Harry !Please .have mercy .have mercy .Not Harry !Not Harry !Please Ill do anything Stand aside .Stand aside girl !He could have forced her away from the crib but it seemed more prudent to finish them all .The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband .The child had not cried all this time He could stand clutching the bars of his crib and he looked up into the intruders face with a kind of bright interest perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak making more pretty lights and his mother would pop up any moment laughing He pointed the wand very carefully into the boys face He wanted to see it happen the destruction of this one inexplicable danger .The child began to cry It had seen that he was not James .He did not like it crying he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage Avada Kedavra !And then he broke He was nothing nothing but pain and terror and he must hide himself not here in the rubble of the ruined house where the child was trapped and screaming but far away .far away .No he moaned .The snake rustled on the filthy cluttered floor and he had killed the boy and yet he was the boy .No .And now he stood at the broken window of Bathildas house immersed in memories of his greatest loss and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass .He looked down and saw something .something incredible .No .Harry its all right youre all right !He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph .There he was the unknown thief the thief he was seeking .No .I dropped it .I dropped it .Harry its okay wake up wake up !He was Harry .Harry not Voldemort .and the thing that was rustling was not a snake .He opened his eyes .Harry Hermione whispered .Do you feel all all right ?Yes he lied .He was in the tent lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets .He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the cold flat light beyond the canvas ceiling .He was drenched in sweat he could feel it on the sheets and blankets .We got away .Yes said Hermione .I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk I couldnt lift you .Youve been .Well you havent been quite .There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand She had been wiping his face .Youve been ill she finished .Quite ill .How long ago did we leave ?Hours ago .Its nearly morning .And Ive been .what unconscious ?Not exactly said Hermione uncomfortably .Youve been shouting and moaning and .things she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy .What had he done ?Screamed curses like Voldemort cried like the baby in the crib ?I couldnt get the Horcrux off you Hermione said and he knew she wanted to change the subject .It was stuck stuck to your chest .Youve got a mark Im sorry I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away .The snake bit you too but Ive cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it .He pulled the sweaty Tshirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down .There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him .He could also see the halfhealed puncture marks to his forearm .Where Ve you put the Horcrux ?In my bag .I think we should keep it off for a while .He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face .We shouldnt have gone to Godrics Hollow .Its my fault its all my fault Hermione Im sorry .Its not your fault .I wanted to go too I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you .Yeah well .we got that wrong didnt we ?What happened Harry ?What happened when she took you upstairs ?Was the snake hiding somewhere ?Did it just come out and kill her and attack you ?No he said .She was the snake .or the snake was her .all along .Wwhat ?He closed his eyes .He could still smell Bathildas house on him It made the whole thing horribly vivid .Bathilda mustve been dead a while .The snake was .was inside her .YouKnowWho put it there in Godrics Hollow to wait .You were right .He knew Id go back .The snake was inside her ?He opened his eyes again Hermione looked revolted nauseated .Lupin said there would be magic wed never imagined Harry said .She didnt want to talk in front of you because it was Parseltongue all Parseltongue and I didnt realize but of course I could understand her .Once we were up in the room the snake sent a message to YouKnowWho I heard it happen inside my head I felt him get excited he said to keep me there .and then .He remembered the snake coming our of Bathildas neck Hermione did not need to know the details . .she changed changed into the snake and attacked .He looked down at the puncture marks .It wasnt supposed to kill me just keep me there till YouKnowWho came .If he had only managed to kill the snake it would have been worth it all of it .Sick at heart he sat up and threw back the covers .Harry no Im sure you ought to rest !Youre the one who needs sleep .No offense but you look terrible .Im fine .Ill keep watch for a while .Wheres my wand ?She did not answer she merely looked at him .Wheres my wand Hermione ?She was biting her lip and tears swam in her eyes .Harry .Wheres my wand ?She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him .The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two .One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together .The wood had splintered apart completely .Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury .He could not think properly Everything was a blur of panic and fear .Then he held out the wand to Hermione .Mend it .Please .Harry I dont think when its broken like this Please Hermione try !RReparo .The dangling half of the wand resealed itself .Harry held it up .Lumosl The wand sparked feebly then went out .Harry pointed it at Hermione .Expelliarmusl Hermione s wand gave a little jerk but did not leave her hand .The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harrys wand which split into two again .He stared at it aghast unable to take in what he was seeing .the wand that had survived so much .Harry Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her .Im so so sorry .I think it was me .As we were leaving you know the snake was coming for us and so I cast a Blasting Curse and it rebounded everywhere and it must have must have hit It was an accident said Harry mechanically .He felt empty stunned .Well well find a way to repair it .Harry I dont think were going to be able to said Hermione the tears trickling down her face .Remember .remember Ron ?When he broke his wand crashing the car ?It was never the same again he had to get a new one .Harry thought of Ollivander kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort of Gregorovitch who was dead .How was he supposed to find himself a new wand ?Well he said in a falsely matteroffact voice well Ill just borrow yours for now then .While I keep watch .Her face glazed with tears Hermione handed over her wand and he left her sitting beside his bed desiring nothing more than to get away from her .THE LIFE AND LIES OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE The sun was coming up The pure colorless vastness of the sky stretched over him indifferent to him and his suffering .Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air .Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth yet he could not appreciate it His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand .He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence .Without realizing it he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain .He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count he had lost all the bones in his right arm once this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead but never until this moment had he felt himself to be fatally weakened vulnerable and naked as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him .He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this The wand is only as good as the wizard .But she was wrong his case was different .She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy .He had lost the protection of the twin cores and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting upon it .He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and without looking at them tucked them away in Hagrids pouch around his neck .The pouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more .Harrys hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away .Impenetrable unhelpful useless like everything else Dumbledore had left behind And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava scorching him inside wiping out every other feeling .Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godrics Hollow held answers convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore but there was no map no plan .Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness to wrestle with unknown and undreamedof terrors alone and unaided Nothing was explained nothing was given freely they had no sword and now Harry had no wand .And he had dropped the photograph of the thief and it would surely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was .Voldemort had all the information now .Harry ?Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand .Her face streaked with tears she crouched down beside him two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm .Thanks he said taking one of the cups .Do you mind if I talk to you ?No he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings .Harry you wanted to know who that man in the picture was .Well .Ive got the book .Timidly she pushed it onto his lap a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore .Where how ?It was in Bathildas sitting room just lying there .This note was sticking out of the top of it .Hermione read the few lines of spiky acidgreen writing aloud . ‘Dear Batty Thanks for your help .Heres a copy of the book hope you like it .You said everything even if you dont remember it .Rita .I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive but perhaps she wasnt in any fit state to read it ?No she probably wasnt .Harry looked down upon Dumbledore s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure Now he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not .Youre still really angry at me arent you ?said Hermione he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes and knew that his anger must have shown in his face .No he said quietly .No Hermione I know it was an accident .You were trying to get us out of there alive and you were incredible .Id be dead if you hadnt been there to help me .He tried to return her watery smile then turned his attention to the book .Its spine was stiff it had clearly never been opened before .He riffled through the pages looking for photographs .He came across the one he sought almost at once the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion roaring with laughter at some longforgotten joke .Harry dropped his eyes to the caption .Albus Dumbledore shortly after his mothers death with his friend Gellert Grindelwald .Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments .Grindelwald .His friend Grindelwald .He looked sideways at Hermione who was still contemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes .Slowly she looked up at Harry .Grindelwald ?Ignoring the remainder of the photographs Harry searched the pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name .He soon discovered it and read greedily but became lost It was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled The Greater Good .Together he and Hermione started to read Now approaching his eighteenth birthday Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory Head Boy Prefect Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional SpellCasting British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot Gold Medal Winner for GroundBreaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo .Dumbledore intended next to take a Grand Tour with Elphias Dogbreath Doge the dimwitted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school .The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London preparing to depart for Greece the following morning when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore s mothers death .Dogbreath Doge who refused to be interviewed for this book has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next .He represents Kendras death as a tragic blow and Dumbledores decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble selfsacrifice .Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godrics Hollow at once supposedly to care for his younger brother and sister .But how much care did he actually give them ?He were a head case that Aberforth says Enid Smeek whose family lived on the outskirts of Godrics Hollow at that time .Ran wild .Course with his mum and dad gone youd have felt sorry for him only he kept chucking goat dung at my head .I dont think Albus was fussed about him I never saw them together anyway .So what was Albus doing if not comforting his wild young brother ?The answer it seems is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister .For though her first jailer had died there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore .Her very existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who like Dogbreath Doge could be counted upon to believe in the story of her ill health .Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot the celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godrics Hollow for many years .Kendra of course had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village .Several years later however the author sent an owl to Albus at Hog warts having been favorably impressed by his paper on transspecies transformation in Transfiguration Today .This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family .At the time of Kendras death Bathilda was the only person in Godrics Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledores mother .Unfortunately the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed .The fires lit but the cauldrons empty as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me or in Enid Smeeks slightly earthier phrase Shes nutty as squirrel poo .Nevertheless a combination of triedandtested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story .Like the rest of the Wizarding world Bathilda puts Kendras premature death down to a backfiring charm a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years .Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana calling her frail and delicate .On one subject however Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum for she and she alone knows the full story of the bestkept secret of Albus Dumbledores life .Now revealed for the first time it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts his opposition to the oppression of Muggles even his devotion to his own family .The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godrics Hollow now an orphan and head of the family Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her greatnephew Gellert Grindelwald .The name of Grindelwald is justly famous In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time he would miss out on the top spot only because YouKnowWho arrived a generation later to steal his crown .As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain however the details of his rise to power are not widely known here .Educated at Durmstrang a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore .Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes however Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits .At sixteen years old even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald and he was expelled .Hitherto all that has been known of Grindelwald s next movements is that he traveled abroad for some months .It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his greataunt in Godrics Hollow and that there intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore .He seemed a charming boy to me babbles Bathilda whatever he became later .Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus who was missing the company of lads his own age .The boys took to each other at once .They certainly did .Bathilda shows me a letter kept by her that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night .Yes even after theyd spent all day in discussion both such brilliant young boys they got on like a cauldron on fire Id sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellerts bedroom window delivering a letter from Albus !An idea would have struck him and he had to let Gellert know immediately !And what ideas they were .Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore s fans will find it here are the thoughts of their seventeenyearold hero as relayed to his new best friend .A copy of the original letter may be seen on Gellert Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES OWN GOOD this I think is the crucial point .Yes we have been given power and yes that power gives us the right to rule but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled .We must stress this point it will be the foundation stone upon which we build .Where we are opposed as we surely will be this must be the basis of all our counterarguments .We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD .And from this it follows that where we meet resistance we must use only the force that is necessary and no more .This was your mistake at Durmstrang !But I do not complain because if you had not been expelled we would never have met .Albus Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles .What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggleboms greatest champion !How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence !How despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister !No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not after all put his plans into action that he must have suffered a change of heart that he came to his senses .However the truth seems altogether more shocking .Barely two months into their great new friendship Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel for more see chapter 22 .What caused this abrupt rupture ?Had Dumbledore come to his senses ?Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans ?Alas no .It was poor little Ariana dying I think that did it says Bathilda .It came as an awful shock .Gellert was there in the house when it happened and he came back to my house all of a dither told me he wanted to go home the next day .Terribly distressed you know .So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of him .Albus was beside himself at Arianas death .It was so dreadful for those two brothers .They had lost everybody except each other .No wonder tempers ran a little high .Aberforth blamed Albus you know as people will under these dreadful circumstances .But Aberforth always talked a little madly poor boy .All the same breaking Albuss nose at the funeral was not decent .It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that across her daughters body .A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral . .He would have been a comfort to Albus at least .This dreadful coffin side brawl known only to those few who attended Ariana Dumbledores funeral raises several questions .Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sisters death ?Was it as Batty pretends a mere effusion of grief ?Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury ?Grindelwald expelled from Durmstrang for nearfatal attacks upon fellow students fled the country hours after the girls death and Albus out of shame or fear ?never saw him again not until forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world .Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life .However there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed for some five years of turmoil fatalities and disappearances his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald .Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate ?Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met ?And how did the mysterious Ariana die ?Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark rite ?Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination ?Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die for the greater good ?The chapter ended here and Harry looked up .Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him .She tugged the book out of Harrys hands looking a little alarmed by his expression and closed it without looking at it as though hiding something indecent .Harry But he shook his head .Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left .He had trusted Dumbledore believed him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom .All was ashes How much more could he lose ?Ron Dumbledore the phoenix wand .Harry .She seemed to have heard his thoughts .Listen to me .It it doesnt make very nice reading Yeah you could say that but dont forget Harry this is Rita Skeeter writing .You did read that letter to Grindelwald didnt you ?Yes I I did .She hesitated looking upset cradling her tea in her cold hands .I think thats the worst bit .I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk but ‘For the Greater Good became Grindelwald s slogan his justification for all the atrocities he committed later .And .from that .it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea .They say ‘For the Greater Good was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard .Whats Nurmengard ?The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents .He ended up in there himself once Dumbledore had caught him .Anyway its its an awful thought that Dumbledore s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power .But on the other hand even Rita cant pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young and I thought youd say that said Harry .He did not want to let his anger spill out at her but it was hard to keep his voice steady .I thought youd say They were young .They were the same age as we are now .And here we are risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts and there he was in a huddle with his new best friend plotting their rise to power over the Muggles .His temper would not remain in check much longer He stood up and walked around trying to work some of it off .Im not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote said Hermione .All that ‘right to rule rubbish its ‘Magic Is Might all over again .But Harry his mother had just died he was stuck alone in the house Alone ?He wasnt alone !He had his brother and sister for company his Squib sister he was keeping locked up I dont believe it said Hermione .She stood up too .Whatever was wrong with that girl I dont think she was a Squib .The Dumbledore we knew would never ever have allowed The Dumbledore we thought we knew didnt want to conquer Muggles by force !Harry shouted his voice echoing across the empty hilltop and several blackbirds rose into the air squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky .He changed Harry he changed !Its as simple as that !Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts !Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggleborn rights who fought YouKnowWho from the start and who died trying to bring him down !Ritas book lay on the ground between them so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both .Harry Im sorry but I think the real reason youre so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself .Maybe I am !Harry bellowed and he flung his arms over his head hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment .Look what he asked from me Hermione !Risk your life Harry !And again !And again !And dont expect me to explain everything just trust me blindly trust that I know what Im doing trust me even though I dont trust you !Never the whole truth !Never !His voice cracked with the strain and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky .He loved you Hermione whispered .I know he loved you .Harry dropped his arms .I dont know who he loved Hermione but it was never me .This isnt love the mess hes left me in .He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me .Harry picked up Hermione s wand which he had dropped in the snow and sat back down in the entrance of the tent .Thanks for the tea .Ill finish the watch .You get back in the warm .She hesitated but recognized the dismissal .She picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent but as she did so she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand .He closed his eyes at her touch and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true that Dumbledore had really cared .THE SILVER DOE It was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight .Harrys dreams were confused and disturbing Nagini wove in and out of them first through a gigantic cracked ring then through a wreath of Christmas roses .He woke repeatedly panicky convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices .Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand .The snow was still falling thickly and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on .Well go somewhere more sheltered she agreed shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas .I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside .I even thought I saw somebody once or twice .Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent motionless Sneakoscope on the table .Im sure I imagined it said Hermione looking nervous .The snow in the dark it plays tricks on your eyes .But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak just in case ?Half an hour later with the tent packed Harry wearing the Horcrux and Hermione clutching the beaded bag they Disapparated .The usual tightness engulfed them Harrys feet parted company with the snowy ground then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves .Where are we ?he asked peering around at a fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles .The Forest of Dean she said .I came camping here once with my mum and dad .Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold but they were at least protected from the wind .They spent most of the day inside the tent huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar .Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness an impression reinforced by Hermione s solicitousness .That afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow .After two nights of little sleep Harrys senses seemed more alert than usual .Their escape from Godrics Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before more threatening .As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermiones offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed .Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so still shivery .The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable .He was on the point of taking out the Marauders Map so as to watch Ginnys dot for a while before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow .Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest .Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister movements .He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself .Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks why should they break now ?And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight .Several times he jerked upright his neck aching because he had fallen asleep slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent .The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition .He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened .A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him moving through the trees .Whatever the source it was moving soundlessly .The light seemed simply to drift toward him .He jumped to his feet his voice frozen in his throat and raised Hermiones wand .He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding the trees in front of it pitchblack in silhouette and still the thing came closer .And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak .It was a silver white doe moonbright and dazzling picking her way over the ground still silent and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow .She stepped toward him her beautiful head with its wide longlashed eyes held high .Harry stared at the creature filled with wonder not at her strangeness but at her inexplicable familiarity .He felt that he had been waiting for her to come but that he had forgotten until this moment that they had arranged to meet .His impulse to shout for Hermione which had been so strong a moment ago had gone .He knew he would have staked his life on it that she had come for him and him alone .They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away .No he said and his voice was cracked with lack of use .Come back !She continued to step deliberately through the trees and soon her brightness was striped by their thick black trunks .For one trembling second he hesitated .Caution murmured it could be a trick a lure a trap .But instinct overwhelming instinct told him that this was not Dark Magic .He set off in pursuit .Snow crunched beneath his feet but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees for she was nothing but light .Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him and Harry walked quickly sure that when she stopped she would allow him to approach her properly .And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know .At last she came to a halt .She turned her beautiful head toward him once more and he broke into a run a question burning in him but as he opened his lips to ask it she vanished .Though the darkness had swallowed her whole her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas it obscured his vision brightening when he lowered his eyelids disorienting him .Now fear came Her presence had meant safety .Lumos he whispered and the wandtip ignited .The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there listening to the sounds of the forest to distant crackles of twigs soft swishes of snow .Was he about to be attacked ?Had she enticed him into an ambush ?Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight watching him ?He held the wand higher .Nobody ran out at him no flash of green light burst from behind a tree .Why then had she led him to this spot ?Something gleamed in the light of the wand and Harry spun about but all that was there was a small frozen pool its cracked black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it .He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down .The ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight but deep below the thick misty gray carapace something else glinted .A great silver cross His heart skipped into his mouth He dropped to his knees at the pools edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible .A glint of deep red .It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt .The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool .Barely breathing he stared down at it .How was this possible ?How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool this close to the place where they were camping ?Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot or was the doe which he had taken to be a Patronus some kind of guardian of the pool ?Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived precisely because they were here ?In which case where was the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry ?Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes searching for a human outline for the glint of an eye but he could not see anyone there .All the same a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool .He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured Accio Sword .It did not stir .He had not expected it to .If it had been that easy the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up not in the depths of a frozen pool .He set off around the circle of ice thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him .He had been in terrible danger then and had asked for help .Help he murmured but the sword remained upon the pool bottom indifferent motionless .What was it Harry asked himself walking again that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword ?Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat .And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor ?A small voice inside Harrys head answered him Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindors apart .Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air .He knew what he had to do .If he was honest with himself he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice .He glanced around at the surrounding trees again but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him .They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool .The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting .With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing .Where chivalry entered into this he thought ruefully he was not entirely sure unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead .An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off and he thought with a pang of Hedwig .He was shivering now his teeth chattering horribly and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear barefooted in the snow .He placed the pouch containing his wand his mothers letter the shard of Siriuss mirror and the old Snitch on top of his clothes then he pointed Hermiones wand at the ice .Diffindo .It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water .As far as Harry could judge it was not deep but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely .Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer .He stepped to the pools edge and placed Hermiones wand on the ground still lit .Then trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering he jumped .Every pore of his body screamed in protest The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water .He could hardly breathe trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool he felt for the blade with his numb feet .He only wanted to dive once .Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second gasping and shaking until he told himself that it must be done gathered all his courage and dived .The cold was agony It attacked him like fire .His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out groping for the sword .His fingers closed around the hilt he pulled it upward .Then something closed tight around his neck .He thought of water weeds though nothing had brushed him as he dived and raised his empty hand to free himself .It was not weed The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe .Harry kicked out wildly trying to push himself back to the surface but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool .Thrashing suffocating he scrabbled at the strangling chain his frozen fingers unable to loosen it and now little lights were popping inside his head and he was going to drown there was nothing left nothing he could do and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Deaths .Choking and retching soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life he came to facedown in the snow .Somewhere close by another person was panting and coughing and staggering around .Hermione had come again as she had come when the snake attacked .Yet it did not sound like her not with those deep coughs not judging by the weight of the footsteps .Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his saviors identity .All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh .It was gone Someone had cut him free .Then a panting voice spoke from over his head .Are you mental ?Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up .Shivering violently he staggered to his feet .There before him stood Ron fully dressed but drenched to the skin his hair plastered to his face the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other .Why the hell panted Ron holding up the Horcrux which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis didnt you take this thing off before you dived ?Harry could not answer .The silver doe was nothing nothing compared with Rons reappearance he could not believe it .Shuddering with cold he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the waters edge and began to pull them on .As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head Harry stared at Ron half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him and yet he had to be real He had just dived into the pool he had saved Harrys life .It was yyou ?Harry said at last his teeth chattering his voice weaker than usual due to his nearstrangulation .Well yeah said Ron looking slightly confused .Yyou cast that doe ?What ?No of course not !I thought it was you doing it !My Patronus is a stag .Oh yeah .I thought it looked different .No antlers .Harry put Hagrids pouch back around his neck pulled on a final sweater stooped to pick up Hermiones wand and faced Ron again .How come youre here ?Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later if at all .Well Ive you know Ive come back .If He cleared his throat .You know .You still want me .There was a pause in which the subject of Rons departure seemed to rise like a wall between them .Yet he was here .He had returned .He had just saved Harrys life .Ron looked down at his hands .He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding .Oh yeah I got it out he said rather unnecessarily holding up the sword for Harrys inspection .Thats why you jumped in right ?Yeah said Harry .But I dont understand .How did you get here ?How did you find us ?Long story said Ron .Ive been looking for you for hours its a big forest isnt it ?And I was just thinking Id have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following .You didnt see anyone else ?No said Ron .I But he hesitated glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away .I did think I saw something move over there but I was running to the pool at the time because youd gone in and you hadnt come up so I wasnt going to make a detour to hey !Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated .The two oaks grew close together there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level an ideal place to see but not be seen .The ground around the roots however was free of snow and Harry could see no sign of footprints .He walked back to where Ron stood waiting still holding the sword and the Horcrux .Anything there ?Ron asked .No said Harry .So how did the sword get in that pool ?Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there .They both looked at the ornate silver sword its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from Hermiones wand .You reckon this is the real one ?asked Ron .One way to find out isnt there ?said Harry .The Horcrux was still swinging from Rons hand .The locket was twitching slightly .Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again .It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it .Now was not the time for long discussions now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all .Harry looked around holding Hermiones wand high and saw the place a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree .Come here he said and he led the way brushed snow from the rocks surface and held out his hand for the Horcrux .When Ron offered the sword however Harry shook his head .No you should do it .Me ?said Ron looking shocked .Why ?Because you got the sword out of the pool .I think its supposed to be you .He was not being kind or generous .As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword .Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic of the incalculable power of certain acts .Im going to open it said Harry and you stab it .Straightaway okay ?Because whatevers in there will put up a fight .The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me .How are you going to open it ?asked Ron .He looked terrified .Im going to ask it to open using Parseltongue said Harry .The answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always known it deep down Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it .He looked at the serpentine S inlaid with glittering green stones It was easy to visualize it as a minuscule snake curled upon the cold rock .No !said Ron .No dont open it !Im serious !Why not ?asked Harry .Lets get rid of the damn thing its been months I cant Harry Im serious you do it But why ?Because that things bad for me !said Ron backing away from the locket on the rock .I cant handle it !Im not making excuses Harry for what I was like but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione it made me think stuff stuff I was thinking anyway but it made everything worse I cant explain it and then Id take it off and Id get my head on straight again and then Id have to put the effing thing back on I cant do it Harry !He had backed away the sword dragging at his side shaking his head .You can do it said Harry you can !Youve just got the sword I know its supposed to be you who uses it .Please just get rid of it Ron .The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant .Ron swallowed then still breathing hard through his long nose moved back toward the rock .Tell me when he croaked .On three said Harry looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes concentrating on the letter S imagining a serpent while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach .It would have been easy to pity it except that the cut around Harrys neck still burned .One .two .three .open .The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click .Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye dark and handsome as Tom Riddles eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit pupiled .Stab said Harry holding the locket steady on the rock .Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes and Harry gripped the locket tightly bracing himself already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows .Then a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux .I have seen your heart and it is mine .Dont listen to it !Harry said harshly .Stab it !I have seen your dreams Ronald Weasley and I have seen your fears .All you desire is possible but all that you dread is also possible .Stab !shouted Harry his voice echoed off the surrounding trees the sword point trembled and Ron gazed down into Riddles eyes .Least loved always by the mother who craved a daughter .Least loved now by the girl who prefers your friend .Second best always eternally overshadowed .Ron stab it now !Harry bellowed He could feel the locket quivering in his grip and was scared of what was coming .Ron raised the sword still higher and as he did so Riddles eyes gleamed scarlet .Out of the lockets two windows out of the eyes there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles the heads of Harry and Hermione weirdly distorted .Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket first chests then waists then legs until they stood in the locket side by side like trees with a common root swaying over Ron and the real Harry who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned suddenly whitehot .Ron !he shouted but the RiddleHarry was now speaking with Voldemorts voice and Ron was gazing mesmerized into its face .Why return ?We were better without you happier without you glad of your absence .We laughed at your stupidity your cowardice your presumption Presumption ?echoed the RiddleHermione who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione She swayed cackling before Ron who looked horrified yet transfixed the sword hanging pointlessly at his side .Who could look at you who would ever look at you beside Harry Potter ?What have you ever done compared with the Chosen One ?What are you compared with the Boy Who Lived ?Ron stab it STAB IT !Harry yelled but Ron did not move His eyes were wide and the RiddleHarry and the RiddleHermione were reflected in them their hair swirling like flames their eyes shining red their voices lifted in an evil duet .Your mother confessed sneered RiddleHarry while RiddleHermione jeered that she would have preferred me as a son would be glad to exchange .Who wouldnt prefer him what woman would take you you are nothing nothing nothing to him crooned RiddleHermione and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around RiddleHarry wrapping him in a close embrace Their lips met .On the ground in front of them Rons face filled with anguish .He raised the sword high his arms shaking .Do it Ron !Harry yelled .Ron looked toward him and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes .Ron ?The sword flashed plunged Harry threw himself out of the way there was a clang of metal and a long drawnout scream .Harry whirled around slipping in the snow wand held ready to defend himself but there was nothing to fight .The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone There was only Ron standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock .Slowly Harry walked back to him hardly knowing what to say or do .Ron was breathing heavily His eyes were no longer red at all but their normal blue they were also wet .Harry stooped pretending he had not seen and picked up the broken Horcrux .Ron had pierced the glass in both windows Riddles eyes were gone and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly .The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished torturing Ron had been its final act .The sword clanged as Ron dropped it .He had sunk to his knees his head in his arms .He was shaking but not Harry realized from cold .Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket knelt down beside Ron and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder .He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off .After you left he said in a low voice grateful for the fact that Rons face was hidden she cried for a week .Probably longer only she didnt want me to see .There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other .With you gone .He could not finish it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them .Shes like my sister he went on .I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me .Its always been like that .I thought you knew .Ron did not respond but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve .Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Rons enormous rucksack lay yards away discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning .He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron who clambered to his feet as Harry approached eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed .Im sorry he said in a thick voice .Im sorry I left .I know I was a a He looked around at the darkness as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him .Youve sort of made up for it tonight said Harry .Getting the sword .Finishing off the Horcrux .Saving my life .That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was Ron mumbled .Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was said Harry .Ive been trying to tell you that for years .Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged Harry gripping the stillsopping back of Rons jacket .And now said Harry as they broke apart all weve got to do is find the tent again .But it was not difficult .Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy with Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time .Harry could not wait to wake Hermione and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent Ron lagging a little behind him .It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor .Hermione was fast asleep curled up under her blankets and did not move until Harry had said her name several times .Hermionel She stirred then sat up quickly pushing her hair out of her face .Whats wrong ?Harry ?Are you all right ?Its okay everythings fine .More than fine .Im great .Theres someone here .What do you mean ?Who ?She saw Ron who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet .Harry backed into a shadowy corner slipped off Rons rucksack and attempted to blend in with the canvas .Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron her eyes upon his pale face .She stopped right in front of him her lips slightly parted her eyes wide .Ron gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms .Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach .Ouch ow gerroff !What the ?Hermione OW !You complete arse Ronald Weasley !She punctuated every word with a blow Ron backed away shielding his head as Hermione advanced .You crawl back here after weeks and weeks oh wheres my wand ?She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harrys hands and he reacted instinctively .Protegol The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor .Spitting hair out of her mouth she leapt up again .Hermione !said Harry .Calm I will not calm down !she screamed .Never before had he seen her lose control like this she looked quite demented .Give me back my wand !Give it back to me Hermione will you please Dont you tell me what to do Harry Potter !she screeched .Dont you dare !Give it back now !And YOU !She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation It was like a malediction and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps .I came running after you !I called you !I begged you to come back !I know Ron said Hermione Im sorry Im really Oh youre sorry !She laughed a highpitched outofcontrol sound Ron looked at Harry for help but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness .You come back after weeks weeks and you think its all going to be all right if you just say sorry ?Well what else can I say ?Ron shouted and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back .Oh I dont know !yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm .Rack your brains Ron that should only take a couple of seconds Hermione interjected Harry who considered this a low blow he just saved my I dont care !she screamed .I dont care what hes done !Weeks and weeks we could have been dead for all he knew I knew you werent dead !bellowed Ron drowning her voice for the first time and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them .Harrys all over the Prophet all over the radio theyre looking for you everywhere all these rumors and mental stories I knew Id hear straight off if you were dead you dont know what its been like What its been like for you ?Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless and Ron seized his opportunity .I wanted to come back the minute Id Disapparated but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers Hermione and I couldnt go anywhere !A gang of what ?asked Harry as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years .Snatchers said Ron .Theyre everywhere gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggleborns and blood traitors theres a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured .I was on my own and I look like I might be school age they got really excited thought I was a Muggleborn in hiding .I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry .What did you say to them ?Told them I was Stan Shunpike .First person I could think of .And they believed that ?They werent the brightest .One of them was definitely part troll the smell off him .Ron glanced at Hermione clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs .Anyway they had a row about whether I was Stan or not .It was a bit pathetic to be honest but there were still five of them and only one of me and theyd taken my wand .Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach grabbed his wand Disarmed the bloke holding mine and Disapparated .I didnt do it so well Splinched myself again Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly and I came out miles from where you were .By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where wed been .youd gone .Gosh what a gripping story Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound .You must have been simply terrified .Meanwhile we went to Godrics Hollow and lets think what happened there Harry ?Oh yes YouKnow Whos snake turned up it nearly killed both of us and then YouKnow Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second .What ?Ron said gaping from her to Harry but Hermione ignored him .Imagine losing fingernails Harry !That really puts our sufferings into perspective doesnt it ?Hermione said Harry quietly Ron just saved my life .She appeared not to have heard him .One thing I would like to know though she said fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Rons head .How exactly did you find us tonight ?Thats important .Once we know well be able to make sure were not visited by anyone else we dont want to see .Ron glared at her then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket .This .She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them .The Deluminator ?she asked so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce .It doesnt just turn the lights on and off said Ron .I dont know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time because Ive been wanting to come back ever since I left .But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard .I heard you .He was looking at Hermione .You heard me on the radio ?she asked incredulously .No I heard you coming out of my pocket .Your voice he held up the Deluminator again came out of this .And what exactly did I say ?asked Hermione her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity .My name . ‘Ron .And you said .something about a wand .Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet .Harry remembered It had been the first time Rons name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left Hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing Harrys wand .So I took it out Ron went on looking at the Deluminator and it didnt seem different or anything but I was sure Id heard you .So I clicked it .And the light went out in my room but another light appeared right outside the window .Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see .It was a ball of light kind of pulsing and bluish like that light you get around a Portkey you know ?Yeah said Harry and Hermione together automatically .I knew this was it said Ron .I grabbed my stuff and packed it then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden .The little ball of light was hovering there waiting for me and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it .well it went inside me .Sorry ?said Harry sure he had not heard correctly .It sort of floated toward me said Ron illustrating the movement with his free index finger right to my chest and then it just went straight through .It was here he touched a point close to his heart I could feel it it was hot .And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do I knew it would take me where I needed to go .So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill .There was snow everywhere .We were there said Harry .We spent two nights there and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out !Yeah well that wouldve been me said Ron .Your protective spells work anyway because I couldnt see you and I couldnt hear you .I was sure you were around though so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear .I thought youd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent .No actually said Hermione .Weve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution .And we left really early because as Harry says wed heard somebody blundering around .Well I stayed on that hill all day said Ron .I kept hoping youd appear .But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you so I clicked the Deluminator again the blue light came out and went inside me and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods .I still couldnt see you so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end and Harry did .Well I saw the doe first obviously .You saw the what ?said Hermione sharply .They explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded Hermione frowned from one to the other of them concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together .But it must have been a Patronus !she said .Couldnt you see who was casting it ?Didnt you see anyone ?And it led you to the sword !I cant believe this !Then what happened ?Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface how he had realized that something was wrong dived in and saved Harry then returned for the sword .He got as far as the opening of the locket then hesitated and Harry cut in .and Ron stabbed it with the sword .And .and it went ?Just like that ?she whispered .Well it it screamed said Harry with half a glance at Ron .Here .He threw the locket into her lap gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows .Deciding that it was at last safe to do so Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermiones wand and turned to Ron .Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand ?What ?said Ron who had been watching Hermione examining the locket .Oh oh yeah .He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of its pocket .Here .I figured its always handy to have a backup .You were right said Harry holding out his hand .Mines broken .Youre kidding ?Ron said but at that moment Hermione got to her feet and he looked apprehensive again .Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word .Ron passed Harry the new wand .About the best you could hope for I think murmured Harry .Yeah said Ron .Couldve been worse .Remember those birds she set on me ?I still havent ruled it out came Hermiones muffled voice from beneath her blankets but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack .XEN OPHILIUS LOVEGOOD Harry had not expected Hermiones anger to abate overnight and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning .Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse .In fact when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only nonmourner at a poorly attended funeral .During those few moments he spent alone with Harry however collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms Ron became shamelessly cheery .Someone helped us he kept saying .Someone sent that doe .Someones on our side .One Horcrux down mate !Bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before Harry felt optimistic certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first .Hermiones sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits The sudden upswing in their fortunes the appearance of the mysterious doe the recovery of Gryffindors sword and above all Rons return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face .Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermiones baleful presence again and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries they continued their ongoing exchange of news .Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermiones various wanderings right up to the full story of what had happened at Godrics Hollow Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away . .and how did you find out about the Taboo ?he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggleborns to evade the Ministry .The what ?You and Hermione have stopped saying YouKnow Whos name !Oh yeah .Well its just a bad habit weve slipped into said Harry .But I havent got a problem calling him V NO !roared Ron causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione nose buried in a book at the tent entrance to scowl over at them .Sorry said Ron wrenching Harry back out of the brambles but the names been jinxed Harry thats how they track people !Using his name breaks protective enchantments it causes some kind of magical disturbance its how they found us in Tottenham Court Road !Because we used his name ?Exactly !Youve got to give them credit it makes sense .It was only people who were serious about standing up to him like Dumbledore who ever dared use it .Now theyve put a Taboo on it anyone who says it is trackable quickandeasy way to find Order members !They nearly got Kingsley Youre kidding ?Yeah a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him Bill said but he fought his way out .Hes on the run now just like us .Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand .You dont reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe ?His Patronus is a lynx we saw it at the wedding remember ?Oh yeah .They moved farther along the hedge away from the tent and Hermione .Harry .you dont reckon it couldve been Dumbledore ?Dumbledore what ?Ron looked a little embarrassed but said in a low voice Dumbledore .the doe ?I mean Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes he had the real sword last didnt he ?Harry did not laugh at Ron because he understood too well the longing behind the question .The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them that he was watching over them would have been inexpressibly comforting .He shook his head .Dumbledores dead he said .I saw it happen I saw the body .Hes definitely gone .Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix not a doe .Patronuses can change though cant they ?said Ron .Tonkss changed didnt it ?Yeah but if Dumbledore was alive why wouldnt he show himself ?Why wouldnt he just hand us the sword ?Search me said Ron .Same reason he didnt give it to you while he was alive ?Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids stories ?Which is what ?asked Harry turning to look Ron full in the face desperate for the answer .I dunno said Ron .Sometimes Ive thought when Ive been a bit hacked off he was having a laugh or or he just wanted to make it more difficult .But I dont think so not anymore .He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator didnt he ?He well Rons ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet which he prodded with his toe he mustve known Id run out on you .No Harry corrected him .He mustve known youd always want to come back .Ron looked grateful but still awkward .Partly to change the subject Harry said Speaking of Dumbledore have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him ?Oh yeah said Ron at once people are talking about it quite a lot .Course if things were different itd be huge news Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald but now its just something to laugh about for people who didnt like Dumbledore and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke .I dont know that its such a big deal though .He was really young when they Our age said Harry just as he had retorted to Hermione and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject .A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles .Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night which Hermione had since condescended to examine and had decided was made of blackthorn .Engorgio .The spider gave a little shiver bouncing slightly in the web .Harry tried again .This time the spider grew slightly larger .Stop that said Ron sharply .Im sorry I said Dumbledore was young okay ?Harry had forgotten Rons hatred of spiders .Sorry Reducio .The spider did not shrink .Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand .Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand .The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar like having somebody elses hand sewn to the end of his arm .You just need to practice said Hermione who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider .Its all a matter of confidence Harry .He knew why she wanted it to be all right She still felt guilty about breaking his wand .He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference and he would have hers instead .Keen for them all to be friends again however he agreed but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more .All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell and Harry took first watch .Sitting in the entrance he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before .Hermione was lying on her bunk reading while Ron after many nervous glances up at her had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it .Theres this one program he told Harry in a low voice that tells the news like it really is .All the others are on You Know Whos side and are following the Ministry line but this one .you wait till you hear it its great .Only they cant do it every night they have to keep changing locations in case theyre raided and you need a password to tune in .Trouble is I missed the last one .He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his breath .He threw Hermione many covert glances plainly fearing an angry outburst but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there .For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered Hermione turned the pages of her book and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand .Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk .Ron ceased his tapping at once .If its annoying you 111 stop !he told Hermione nervously .Hermione did not deign to respond but approached Harry .We need to talk she said .He looked at the book still clutched in her hand .It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore .What ?he said apprehensively .It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there he was not sure he felt up to hearing Ritas version of his relationship with Dumbledore .Hermione s answer however was completely unexpected .I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood .He stared at her .Sorry ?Xenophilius Lovegood .Lunas father .I want to go and talk to him !Er why ?She took a deep breath as though bracing herself and said Its that mark the mark in Beedle the Bard .Look at this !She thrust The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore under Harrys unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald with Dumbledore s familiar thin slanting handwriting .He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words that they had not been Ritas invention .The signature said Hermione .Look at the signature Harry !He obeyed .For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about but looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard .Er what are you ?said Ron tentatively but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry .It keeps cropping up doesnt it ?she said .I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald s mark but it was definitely on that old grave in Godrics Hollow and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along !And now this !Well we cant ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means I dont even know whether Grindelwalds still alive but we can ask Mr Lovegood .He was wearing the symbol at the wedding .Im sure this is important Harry !Harry did not answer immediately .He looked into her intense eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness thinking .After a long pause he said Hermione we dont need another Godrics Hollow .We talked ourselves into going there and But it keeps appearing Harry !Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard how do you know were not supposed to find out about the sign ?Here we go again !Harry felt slightly exasperated .We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful piped up Ron .I think Hermiones right I think we ought to go and see Lovegood .Harry threw him a dark look .He was quite sure that Rons support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune .It wont be like Godrics Hollow Ron added Lovegoods on your side Harry The Quibblers been for you all along it keeps telling everyone theyve got to help you !Im sure this is important !said Hermione earnestly .But dont you think if it was Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died ?Maybe .maybe its something you need to find out for yourself said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws .Yeah said Ron sycophantically that makes sense .No it doesnt snapped Hermione but I still think we ought to talk to Mr Lovegood .A symbol that links Dumbledore Grindelwald and Godrics Hollow ?Harry Im sure we ought to know about this !I think we should vote on it said Ron .Those in favor of going to see Lovegood His hand flew into the air before Hermiones .Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own .Outvoted Harry sorry said Ron clapping him on the back .Fine said Harry half amused half irritated .Only once weve seen Lovegood lets try and look for some more Horcruxes shall we ?Where do the Lovegoods live anyway ?Do either of you know ?Yeah theyre not far from my place said Ron .I dunno exactly where but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them .Shouldnt be hard to find .When Hermione had returned to her bunk Harry lowered his voice .You only agreed to try and get back in her good books .Alls fair in love and war said Ron brightly and this is a bit of both .Cheer up its the Christmas holidays Luna ll be home !They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St .Catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning .From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds .They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow their hands shadowing their eyes but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes .Its weird being this near but not going to visit said Ron .Well its not like you havent just seen them .You were there for Christmas said Hermione coldly .I wasnt at the Burrow !said Ron with an incredulous laugh .Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all Id walked out on you ?Yeah Fred and George wouldve been great about it .And Ginny shed have been really understanding .But where have you been then ?asked Hermione surprised .Bill and Fleurs new place .Shell Cottage .Bills always been decent to me .He he wasnt impressed when he heard what Id done but he didnt go on about it .He knew I was really sorry .None of the rest of the family know I was there .Bill told Mum he and Fleur werent going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone .You know first holiday after they were married .I dont think Fleur minded .You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck .Ron turned his back on the Burrow .Lets try up here he said leading the way over the top of the hill .They walked for a few hours Harry at Hermione s insistence hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak .The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage which seemed deserted .Do you think its theirs and theyve gone away for Christmas ?said Hermione peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill .Ron snorted .Listen Ive got a feeling youd be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the Lovegoods window .Lets try the next lot of hills .So they Disapparated a few miles farther north .Aha !shouted Ron as the wind whipped their hair and clothes .Ron was pointing upward toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared where a most strangelooking house rose vertically against the sky a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky .Thats got to be Lunas house who else would live in a place like that ?It looks like a giant rook !Its nothing like a bird said Hermione frowning at the tower .I was talking about a chess rook said Ron .A castle to you .Rons legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first .When Harry and Hermione caught up with him panting and clutching stitches in their sides they found him grinning broadly .Its theirs said Ron .Look .Three handpainted signs had been tacked to a brokendown gate .The first read THE QUIBBLER .EDITOR X .LOVEGOOD the second PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE the third KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS The gate creaked as they opened it .The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings .Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth .Two aged crab apple trees bent with the wind stripped of leaves but still heavy with berrysized red fruits and bushy crowns of whitebeaded mistletoe stood sentinel on either side of the front door .A little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches .Youd better take off the Invisibility Cloak Harry said Hermione .Its you Mr Lovegood wants to help not us .He did as she suggested handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag .She then rapped three times on the thick black door which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle .Barely ten seconds passed then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt .Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleurs wedding by comparison .What ?What is it ?Who are you ?What do you want ?he cried in a highpitched querulous voice looking first at Hermione then at Ron and finally at Harry upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical O .Hello Mr Lovegood said Harry holding out his hand .Im Harry Harry Potter .Xenophilius did not take Harrys hand although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harrys forehead .Would it be okay if we came in ?asked Harry .Theres something wed like to ask you .I .Im not sure thats advisable whispered Xenophilius .He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden .Rather a shock .My word .I .Im afraid I dont really think I ought to It wont take long said Harry slightly disappointed by this lessthanwarm welcome .I oh all right then .Come in quickly .QuicklyV They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them .They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen .The room was perfectly circular so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot .Everything was curved to fit the walls the stove the sink and the cupboards and all of it had been painted with flowers insects and birds in bright primary colors .Harry thought he recognized Lunas style The effect in such an enclosed space was slightly overwhelming .In the middle of the floor a wroughtiron spiral staircase led to the upper levels .There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead Harry wondered what Luna could be doing .Youd better come up said Xenophilius still looking extremely uncomfortable and he led the way .The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace and as such was even more cluttered than the kitchen .Though much smaller and entirely round the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects .There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface .Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognize all flapping wings or snapping jaws hung from the ceiling .Luna was not there The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels .It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old fashioned printing press due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers .Excuse me said Xenophilius and he strode over to the machine seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers which all tumbled onto the floor and threw it over the press somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters .He then faced Harry .Why have you come here ?Before Harry could speak however Hermione let out a small cry of shock .Mr Lovegood whats that ?She was pointing at an enormous gray spiral horn not unlike that of a unicorn which had been mounted on the wall protruding several feet into the room .It is the horn of a CrumpleHorned Snorkack said Xenophilius .No it isnt !said Hermione .Hermione muttered Harry embarrassed nows not the moment But Harry its an Erumpent horn !Its a Class B Tradeable Material and its an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house !How dyou know its an Erumpent horn ?asked Ron edging away from the horn as fast as he could given the extreme clutter of the room .Theres a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them .Mr Lovegood you need to get rid of it straightaway dont you know it can explode at the slightest touch ?The CrumpleHorned Snorkack said Xenophilius very clearly a mulish look upon his face is a shy and highly magical creature and its horn Mr Lovegood I recognize the grooved markings around the base thats an Erumpent horn and its incredibly dangerous I dont know where you got it I bought it said Xenophilius dogmatically two weeks ago from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack .A Christmas surprise for my Luna .Now he said turning to Harry why exactly have you come here Mr Potter ?We need some help said Harry before Hermione could start again .Ah said Xenophilius .Help .Hmm .His good eye moved again to Harrys scar .He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized .Yes .The thing is .helping Harry Potter .rather dangerous .Arent you the one who keeps telling everyone its their first duty to help Harry ?said Ron .In that magazine of yours ?Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth .Er yes I have expressed that view .However Thats for everyone else to do not you personally ?said Ron .Xenophilius did not answer .He kept swallowing his eyes darting between the three of them .Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle .Wheres Luna ?asked Hermione .Lets see what she thinks .Xenophilius gulped .He seemed to be steeling himself .Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press Luna is down at the stream fishing for Freshwater Plimpies .She .she will like to see you .Ill go and call her and then yes very well .I shall try to help you .He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close .They looked at each other .Cowardly old wart said Ron .Lunas got ten times his guts .Hes probably worried about whatll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here said Harry .Well I agree with Ron said Hermione .Awful old hypocrite telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself .And for heavens sake keep away from that horn .Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room .He could see a stream a thin glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill .They were very high up a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow now invisible beyond another line of hills .Ginny was over there somewhere .They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleurs wedding but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now thinking of her .He supposed he ought to be glad of it anyone he came into contact with was in danger Xenophiliuss attitude proved that .He turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered curved sideboard a stone bust of a beautiful but austerelooking witch wearing a most bizarrelooking headdress .Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides .A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead .Look at this said Harry .Fetching said Ron .Surprised he didnt wear that to the wedding .They heard the front door close and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots bearing a tray of illassorted teacups and a steaming teapot .Ah you have spotted my pet invention he said shoving the tray into Hermiones arms and joining Harry at the statues side .Modeled fittingly enough upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw . ‘Wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasureV He indicated the objects like ear trumpets .These are the Wrackspurt siphons to remove all sources of distraction from the thinkers immediate area .Here he pointed out the tiny wings a billywig propeller to induce an elevated frame of mind .Finally he pointed to the orange radish the Dirigible Plum so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary .Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray which Hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables .May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots ?said Xenophilius .We make it ourselves .As he started to pour out the drink which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice he added Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge she is most excited that you are here .She ought not to be too long she has caught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us .Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar .Now he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down his Wellingtoned legs crossed how may I help you Mr Potter ?Well said Harry glancing at Hermione who nodded encouragingly its about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleurs wedding Mr Lovegood .We wondered what it meant .Xenophilius raised his eyebrows .Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows ?THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione .Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either .The Deathly Hallows ?Thats right said Xenophilius .You havent heard of them ?Im not surprised .Very very few wizards believe .Witness that knuckleheaded young man at your brothers wedding he nodded at Ron who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a wellknown Dark wizard !Such ignorance .There is nothing Dark about the Hallows at least not in that crude sense .One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers in the hope that they might help one with the Quest .He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some .Im sorry said Harry .I still dont really understand .To be polite he took a sip from his cup too and almost gagged The stuff was quite disgusting as though someone had liquidized bogeyflavored Every Flavor Beans .Well you see believers seek the Deathly Hallows said Xenophilius smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion .But what are the Deathly Hallows ?asked Hermione .Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup .I assume that you are all familiar with The Tale of the Three Brothers ?Harry said No but Ron and Hermione both said Yes .Xenophilius nodded gravely .Well well Mr Potter the whole thing starts with The Tale of the Three Brothers .I have a copy somewhere .He glanced vaguely around the room at the piles of parchment and books but Hermione said Ive got a copy Mr Lovegood Ive got it right here .And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small beaded bag .The original ?inquired Xenophilius sharply and when she nodded he said Well then why dont you read it aloud ?Much the best way to make sure we all understand .Er .all right said Hermione nervously .She opened the book and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough and began to read . ‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight Midnight our mum always told us said Ron who had stretched out arms behind his head to listen .Hermione shot him a look of annoyance .Sorry I just think its a bit spookier if its midnight !said Ron .Yeah because we really need a bit more fear in our lives said Harry before he could stop himself .Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention but was staring out of the window at the sky .Go on Hermione . ‘In time the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across .However these brothers were learned in the magical arts and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water .They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure . ‘And Death spoke to them Sorry interjected Harry but Death spoke to them ?Its a fairy tale Harry !Right sorry .Go on . ‘And Death spoke to them .He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims for travelers usually drowned in the river .But Death was cunning .He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him . ‘So the oldest brother who was a combative man asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence a wand that must always win duels for its owner a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death !So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there and gave it to the oldest brother . ‘Then the second brother who was an arrogant man decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further and asked for the power to recall others from Death .So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead . ‘And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like .The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers and he did not trust Death .So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death .And Death most unwillingly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility .Deaths got an Invisibility Cloak ?Harry interrupted again .So he can sneak up on people said Ron .Sometimes he gets bored of running at them flapping his arms and shrieking .sorry Hermione . ‘Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Deaths gifts . ‘In due course the brothers separated each for his own destination . ‘The first brother traveled on for a week or more and reaching a distant village sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel .Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon he could not fail to win the duel that followed .Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself and of how it made him invincible . ‘That very night another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay winesodden upon his bed .The thief took the wand and for good measure slit the oldest brothers throat . ‘And so Death took the first brother for his own . ‘Meanwhile the second brother journeyed to his own home where he lived alone .Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead and turned it thrice in his hand .To his amazement and his delight the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared at once before him . ‘Yet she was sad and cold separated from him as by a veil .Though she had returned to the mortal world she did not truly belong there and suffered .Finally the second brother driven mad with hopeless longing killed himself so as truly to join her . ‘And so Death took the second brother for his own . ‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years he was never able to find him .It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son .And then he greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly and equals they departed this life .Hermione closed the book .It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said Well there you are .Sorry ?said Hermione sounding confused .Those are the Deathly Hallows said Xenophilius .He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books .The Elder Wand he said and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment .The Resurrection Stone he said and he added a circle on top of the line .The Cloak of Invisibility he finished enclosing both line and circle in a triangle to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione .Together he said the Deathly Hallows .But theres no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows in the story said Hermione .Well of course not said Xenophilius maddeningly smug .That is a childrens tale told to amuse rather than to instruct .Those of us who understand these matters however recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects or Hallows which if united will make the possessor master of Death .There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window .Already the sun was low in the sky .Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon he said quietly .When you say ‘master of Death said Ron .Master said Xenophilius waving an airy hand .Conqueror .Vanquisher .Whichever term you prefer .But then .do you mean .said Hermione slowly and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice that you believe these objects these Hallows actually exist ?Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again .Well of course .But said Hermione and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack Mr Lovegood how can you possibly believe ?Luna has told me all about you young lady said Xenophilius .You are I gather not unintelligent but painfully limited .Narrow .Closeminded .Perhaps you ought to try on the hat Hermione said Ron nodding toward the ludicrous headdress .His voice shook with the strain of not laughing .Mr Lovegood Hermione began again .We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks .They are rare but they exist .But Ah but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility Miss Granger !I mean to say it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm or carrying a Bedazzling Hex or else woven from Demiguise hair which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque .We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it .How many cloaks have you ever seen like that Miss Granger ?Hermione opened her mouth to answer then closed it again looking more confused than ever .She Harry and Ron glanced at one another and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing .It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment .Exactly said Xenophilius as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument .None of you have ever seen such a thing .The possessor would be immeasurably rich would he not ?He glanced out of the window again .The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink .All right said Hermione disconcerted .Say the Cloak existed .what about the stone Mr Lovegood ?The thing you call the Resurrection Stone ?What of it ?Well how can that be real ?Prove that it is not said Xenophilius .Hermione looked outraged .But thats Im sorry but thats completely ridiculous !How can I possibly prove it doesnt exist ?Do you expect me to get hold of of all the pebbles in the world and test them ?I mean you could claim that anythings real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobodys proved it doesnt exist !Yes you could said Xenophilius .I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little .So the Elder Wand said Harry quickly before Hermione could retort you think that exists too ?Oh well in that case there is endless evidence said Xenophilius .The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand .Which is what ?asked Harry .Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner if he is to be truly master of it said Xenophilius .Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil ?Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son Hereward took the wand from him ?Of the dreadful Loxias who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill whom he had killed ?The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history .Harry glanced at Hermione .She was frowning at Xenophilius but she did not contradict him .So where do you think the Elder Wand is now ?asked Ron .Alas who knows ?said Xenophilius as he gazed out of the window .Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden ?The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius .Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias and which took the wand ?And who can say who may have defeated them ?History alas does not tell us .There was a pause .Finally Hermione asked stiffly Mr Lovegood does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows ?Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harrys memory but he could not locate it .Peverell .he had heard that name before .But you have been misleading me young woman !said Xenophilius now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione .I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest !Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything everything !to do with the Hallows !Who are the Peverells ?asked Ron .That was the name on the grave with the mark on it in Godrics Hollow said Hermione still watching Xenophilius .Ignotus Peverell .Exactly !said Xenophilius his forefinger raised pedantically .The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus s grave is conclusive proof !Of what ?asked Ron .Why that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers Antioch Cadmus and Ignotus !That they were the original owners of the Hallows !With another glance at the window he got to his feet picked up the tray and headed for the spiral staircase .You will stay for dinner ?he called as he vanished downstairs again .Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup .Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St .Mungos said Ron under his breath .Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking .What do you think ?he asked Hermione .Oh Harry she said wearily its a pile of utter rubbish .This cant be what the sign really means .This must just be his weird take on it .What a waste of time .I spose this is the man who brought us Crumple Horned Snorkacks said Ron .You dont believe it either ?Harry asked him .Nah that storys just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons isnt it ? ‘Dont go looking for trouble dont pick fights dont go messing around with stuff thats best left alone !Just keep your head down mind your own business and youll be okay Come to think of it Ron added maybe that storys why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky .What are you talking about ?One of those superstitions isnt it ? ‘Mayborn witches will marry Muggles . ‘Jinx by twilight undone by midnight . ‘Wand of elder never prosper .You mustve heard them .My mums full of them .Harry and I were raised by Muggles Hermione reminded him .We were taught different superstitions .She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen .The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron .I think youre right she told him .Its just a morality tale its obvious which gift is best which one youd choose The three of them spoke at the same time Hermione said the Cloak Ron said the wand and Harry said the stone .They looked at each other half surprised half amused .Youre supposed to say the Cloak Ron told Hermione but you wouldnt need to be invisible if you had the wand .An unbeatable wand Hermione come on !Weve already got an Invisibility Cloak said Harry .And its helped us rather a lot in case you hadnt noticed !said Hermione .Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble Only if you shouted about it argued Ron .Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head and singing ‘Ive got an unbeatable wand come and have a go if you think youre hard enough .As long as you kept your trap shut Yes but could you keep your trap shut ?said Hermione looking skeptical .You know the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra powerful wands for hundreds of years .There have ?asked Harry .Hermione looked exasperated The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other .The Deathstick the Wand of Destiny they crop up under different names through the centuries usually in the possession of some Dark wizard whos boasting about them .Professor Binns mentioned some of them but oh its all nonsense .Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them .Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other peoples .But how do you know said Harry that those wands the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny arent the same wand surfacing over the centuries under different names ?What and theyre all really the Elder Wand made by Death ?said Ron .Harry laughed The strange idea that had occurred to him was after all ridiculous .His wand he reminded himself had been of holly not elder and it had been made by Ollivander whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies .And if it had been unbeatable how could it have been broken ?So why would you take the stone ?Ron asked him .Well if you could bring people back we could have Sirius .MadEye .Dumbledore .my parents .Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled .But according to Beedle the Bard they wouldnt want to come back would they ?said Harry thinking about the tale they had just heard .I dont suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead have there ?he asked Hermione .No she replied sadly .I dont think anyone except Mr Lovegood could kid themselves thats possible .Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerers Stone you know instead of a stone to make you immortal a stone to reverse death .The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger It was something like burning underpants .Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings .What about the Cloak though ?said Ron slowly .Dont you realize hes right ?Ive got so used to Harrys Cloak and how good it is I never stopped to think .Ive never heard of one like Harrys .Its infallible .Weve never been spotted under it Of course not were invisible when were under it Ron !But all the stuff he said about other cloaks and theyre not exactly ten a Knut you know is true !Its never occurred to me before but Ive heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old or them being ripped apart by spells so theyve got holes in .Harrys was owned by his dad so its not exactly new is it but its just .perfect !Yes all right but Ron the stone .As they argued in whispers Harry moved around the room only half listening .Reaching the spiral stair he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once .His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above .After a moments bewilderment he realized that it was not a mirror but a painting .Curious he began to climb the stairs .Harry what are you doing ?I dont think you should look around when hes not here !But Harry had already reached the next level .Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces Harry Ron Hermione Ginny and Neville .They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved but there was a certain magic about them all the same Harry thought they breathed .What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures linking them together but after examining them for a minute or so Harry realized that the chains were actually one word repeated a thousand times in golden ink friends .friends .friends .Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna .He looked around the room .There was a large photograph beside the bed of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her .They were hugging .Luna looked rather bettergroomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life .The picture was dusty .This struck Harry as slightly odd .He stared around .Something was wrong .The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust .There were no clothes in the wardrobe whose doors stood ajar .The bed had a cold unfriendly look as though it had not been slept in for weeks .A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window across a bloodred sky .Whats wrong ?Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase but before he could respond Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen now holding a tray laden with bowls .Mr Lovegood said Harry .Wheres Luna ?Excuse me ?Wheres Luna ?Xenophilius halted on the top step .I Ive already told you .She is down at Bottom Bridge fishing for Plimpies .So why have you only laid that tray for four ?Xenophilius tried to speak but no sound came out .The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius s hands shook .I dont think Lunas been here for weeks said Harry .Her clothes are gone her bed hasnt been slept in .Where is she ?And why do you keep looking out of the window ?Xenophilius dropped the tray The bowls bounced and smashed .Harry Ron and Hermione drew their wands Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket .At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth the press fell silent at last .Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines her wand still pointing at Mr Lovegood .Harry look at this .He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter .The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture emblazoned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE and captioned with the reward money .The Quibblers going for a new angle then ?Harry asked coldly his mind working very fast .Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden Mr Lovegood ?Sending an owl to the Ministry ?Xenophilius licked his lips .They took my Luna he whispered .Because of what Ive been writing .They took my Luna and I dont know where she is what theyve done to her .But they might give her back to me if I if I Hand over Harry ?Hermione finished for him .No deal said Ron flatly .Get out of the way were leaving .Xenophilius looked ghastly a century old his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer .They will be here at any moment .I must save Luna .I cannot lose Luna .You must not leave .He spread his arms in front of the staircase and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib .Dont make us hurt you Harry said .Get out of the way Mr Lovegood .HARRY !Hermione screamed .Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows .As the three of them looked away from him Xenophilius drew his wand .Harry realized their mistake just in time He launched himself sideways shoving Ron and Hermione out of harms way as Xenophiliuss Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn .There was a colossal explosion .The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust .Harry flew through the air then crashed to the floor unable to see as debris rained upon him his arms over his head .He heard Hermiones scream Rons yell and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs .Half buried in rubble Harry tried to raise himself He could barely breathe or see for dust .Half of the ceiling had fallen in and the end of Lunas bed was hanging through the hole .The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air and most of the printing press lay on its side blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen .Then another white shape moved close by and Hermione coated in dust like a second statue pressed her finger to her lips .The door downstairs crashed open .Didnt I tell you there was no need to hurry Travers ?said a rough voice .Didnt 1 tell you this nutter was just raving as usual ?There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius .No .no .upstairs .Potter !I told you last week Lovegood we werent coming back for anything less than some solid information !Remember last week ?When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress ?And the week before another bang another squeal when you thought wed give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple bang Headed bang Snorkacks ?No no I beg you !sobbed Xenophilius .It really is Potter !Really !And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up !roared the Death Eater and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius .The place looks like its about to fall in Selwyn said a cool second voice echoing up the mangled staircase .The stairs are completely blocked .Could try clearing it ?Might bring the place down .You lying piece of filth shouted the wizard named Selwyn .Youve never seen Potter in your life have you ?Thought youd lure us here to kill us did you ?And you think youll get your girl back like this ?I swear .I swear .Potters upstairs !Homenum revelio said the voice at the foot of the stairs .Harry heard Hermione gasp and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him immersing his body in its shadow .Theres someone up there all right Selwyn said the second man sharply .Its Potter I tell you its Potter !sobbed Xenophilius .Please .please .give me Luna just let me have Luna .You can have your little girl Lovegood said Selwyn if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter .But if this is a plot if its a trick if youve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us well see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury .Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair .There were scurryings and scrapings Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs .Come on Harry whispered weve got to get out of here .He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase .Ron was buried deepest Harry and Hermione climbed as quietly as they could over all the wreckage to where he lay trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs .While Xenophilius s banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm .All right breathed Hermione as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble Xenophilius was feet away from them .She was still white with dust .Do you trust me Harry ?Harry nodded .Okay then Hermione whispered give me the Invisibility Cloak .Ron youre going to put it on .Me ?But Harry Please Ron Harry hold on tight to my hand Ron grab my shoulder .Harry held out his left hand .Ron vanished beneath the Cloak .The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm .Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for .Hold tight she whispered .Hold tight .any second Xenophiliuss paper white face appeared over the top of the sideboard .Obliviate cried Hermione pointing her wand first into his face then at the floor beneath them .Deprimo She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor .They fell like boulders Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life there was a scream from below and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling .Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harrys ears as she dragged him once more into darkness .THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Harry fell panting onto grass and scrambled up at once .They seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk Hermione was already running in a circle around them waving her wand .Protego Totalum .Salvio Hexia .That treacherous old bleeder !Ron panted emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry .Hermione youre a genius a total genius I cant believe we got out of that !Cave Inimicum .Didnt I say it was an Erumpent horn didnt I tell him ?And now his house has been blown apart !Serves him right said Ron examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs .What dyou reckon theyll do to him ?Oh I hope they dont kill him !groaned Hermione .Thats why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left so they knew Xenophilius hadnt been lying !Why hide me though ?asked Ron .Youre supposed to be in bed with spattergroit Ron !Theyve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry !What would happen to your family if they knew youre with him ?But what about your mum and dad ?Theyre in Australia said Hermione .They should be all right .They dont know anything .Youre a genius Ron repeated looking awed .Yeah you are Hermione agreed Harry fervently .I dont know what wed do without you .She beamed but became solemn at once .What about Luna ?Well if theyre telling the truth and shes still alive began Ron .Dont say that dont say it !squealed Hermione .She must be alive she must !Then shell be in Azkaban I expect said Ron .Whether she survives the place though .Loads dont .She will said Harry .He could not bear to contemplate the alternative .Shes tough Luna much tougher than youd think .Shes probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles .I hope youre right said Hermione .She passed a hand over her eyes .Id feel so sorry for Xenophilius if if he hadnt just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters yeah said Ron .They put up the tent and retreated inside it where Ron made them tea .After their narrow escape the chilly musty old place felt like home safe familiar and friendly .Oh why did we go there ?groaned Hermione after a few minutes silence .Harry you were right it was Godrics Hollow all over again a complete waste of time !The Deathly Hallows .such rubbish .although actually a sudden thought seemed to have struck her he might have made it all up mightnt he ?He probably doesnt believe in the Deathly Hallows at all he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived !I dont think so said Ron .Its a damn sight harder making stuff up when youre under stress than youd think .I found that out when the Snatchers caught me .It was much easier pretending to be Stan because I knew a bit about him than inventing a whole new person .Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure trying to make sure we stayed put .I reckon he told us the truth or what he thinks is the truth just to keep us talking .Well I dont suppose it matters sighed Hermione .Even if he was being honest I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life .Hang on though said Ron .The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth wasnt it ?But the Deathly Hallows cant exist Ron !You keep saying that but one of them can said Ron .Harrys Invisibility Cloak The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story said Hermione firmly .A story about how humans are frightened of death .If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak wed have everything we need already !I dont know .We could do with an unbeatable wand said Harry turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers .Theres no such thing Harry !You said there have been loads of wands the Deathstick and whatever they were called All right even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wands real what about the Resurrection Stone ?Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name and her tone dripped sarcasm .No magic can raise the dead and thats that !When my wand connected with YouKnowWhos it made my mum and dad appear .and Cedric .But they werent really back from the dead were they ?said Hermione .Those kinds of of pale imitations arent the same as truly bringing someone back to life .But she the girl in the tale didnt really come back did she ?The story says that once people are dead they belong with the dead .But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her didnt he ?He even lived with her for a while .He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermiones expression .Then as she glanced at Ron Harry realized that it was fear He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people .So that Peverell bloke whos buried in Godrics Hollow he said hastily trying to sound robustly sane you dont know anything about him then ?No she replied looking relieved at the change of subject .I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave if hed been anyone famous or done anything important Im sure hed be in one of our books .The only place Ive managed to find the name ‘Peverell is Natures Nobility A Wizarding Genealogy .I borrowed it from Kreacher she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows .It lists the pureblood families that are now extinct in the male line .Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish . ‘Extinct in the male line ?repeated Ron .It means the names died out said Hermione centuries ago in the case of the Peverells .They could still have descendants though theyd just be called something different .And then it came to Harry in one shining piece the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name Peverell a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official and he cried aloud Marvolo Gaunt !Sorry ?said Ron and Hermione together .Marvolo Gaunti You Know Whos grandfather !In the Pensieve !With Dumbledore !Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells !Ron and Hermione looked bewildered .The ring the ring that became the Horcrux Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it !I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministrys face he nearly shoved it up his nose !The Peverell coat of arms ?said Hermione sharply .Could you see what it looked like ?Not really said Harry trying to remember .There was nothing fancy on there as far as I could see maybe a few scratches .I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open .Harry saw Hermione s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes .Ron was looking from one to the other astonished .Blimey .You reckon it was this sign again ?The sign of the Hallows ?Why not ?said Harry excitedly .Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig all he cared about was his ancestry .If that ring had been passed down through the centuries he might not have known what it really was .There were no books in that house and trust me he wasnt the type to read fairy tales to his kids .Hed have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms because as far as he was concerned having pure blood made you practically royal .Yes .and thats all very interesting said Hermione cautiously but Harry if youre thinking what I think youre think Well why not ?Why not ?said Harry abandoning caution .It was a stone wasnt it ?He looked at Ron for support .What if it was the Resurrection Stone ?Rons mouth fell open .Blimey but would it still work if Dumbledore broke ?Work ?Work ?Ron it never worked !Theres no such thing as a Resurrection Stone Hermione had leapt to her feet looking exasperated and angry .Harry youre trying to fit everything into the Hallows story Fit everything in ?he repeated .Hermione it fits of its own accord !I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone !Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells !A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly !Where dyou reckon the ring is now ?Ron asked Harry .What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open ?But Harrys imagination was racing ahead far beyond Ron and Hermione s .Three objects or Hallows which if united will make the possessor master of Death .Master .Conqueror .Vanquisher .The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .And he saw himself possessor of the Hallows facing Voldemort whose Horcruxes were no match .Neither can live while the other survives .Was this the answer ?Hallows versus Horcruxes ?Was there a way after all to ensure that he was the one who triumphed ?If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows would he be safe ?Harry ?But he scarcely heard Hermione He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers the cloth supple as water light as air .He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world .The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it .And then with a gasp he remembered Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died !His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face but he did not care .My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak !This is why !He wanted to examine it because he thought it was the third Hallow !Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godrics Hollow .Harry was walking blindly around the tent feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him .Hes my ancestor !Im descended from the third brother !It all makes sense !He felt armed in certainty in his belief in the Hallows as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two .Harry said Hermione again but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck his fingers shaking hard .Read it he told her pushing his mothers letter into her hand .Read it !Dumbledore had the Cloak Hermione !Why else would he want it ?He didnt need a Cloak he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one !Something fell to the floor and rolled glittering under a chair He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter .He stooped to pick it up and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out .ITS IN HERE !He left me the ring its in the Snitch !You you reckon ?He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback .It was so obvious so clear to Harry Everything fit everything .His Cloak was the third Hallow and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow the Elder Wand and then But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage All his excitement all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke and he stood alone in the darkness and the glorious spell was broken .Thats what hes after .The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared .YouKnowWhos after the Elder Wand .He turned his back on their strained incredulous faces .He knew it was the truth .It all made sense .Voldemort was not seeking a new wand he was seeking an old wand a very old wand indeed .Harry walked to the entrance of the tent forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night thinking .Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage .Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child any more than Harry had heard them .Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows .Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them ?Harry gazed into the darkness .If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows surely he would have sought them done anything to possess them three objects that made the possessor master of Death ?If he had known about the Deathly Hallows he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place .Didnt the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow and turned it into a Horcrux demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret ?Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power without understanding that it was one of three .for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden whose existence was best known .The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history .Harry watched the cloudy sky curves of smokegray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon .He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries .He turned back into the tent .It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them Hermione still holding Lilys letter Ron at her side looking slightly anxious .Didnt they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes ?This is it Harry said trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty .This explains everything .The Deathly Hallows are real and Ive got one maybe two He held up the Snitch .and YouKnowWhos chasing the third but he doesnt realize .he just thinks its a powerful wand Harry said Hermione moving across to him and handing him back Lilys letter Im sorry but I think youve got this wrong all wrong .But dont you see ?It all fits No it doesnt she said .It doesnt Harry youre just getting carried away .Please she said as he started to speak please just answer me this If the Deathly Hallows really existed and Dumbledore knew about them knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death Harry why wouldnt he have told you ?Why ?He had his answer ready .But you said it Hermione !Youve got to find out about them for yourself !Its a Quest !But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods !cried Hermione in exasperation .I didnt really believe it !Harry took no notice .Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself .He let me try my strength take risks .This feels like the kind of thing hed do .Harry this isnt a game this isnt practice !This is the real thing and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions Find and destroy the Horcruxes !That symbol doesnt mean anything forget the Deathly Hallows we cant afford to get sidetracked Harry was barely listening to her .He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands half expecting it to break open to reveal the Resurrection Stone to prove to Hermione that he was right that the Deathly Hallows were real .She appealed to Ron .You dont believe in this do you ?Harry looked up .Ron hesitated .I dunno .I mean .bits of it sort of fit together said Ron awkwardly .But when you look at the whole thing .He took a deep breath .I think were supposed to get rid of Horcruxes Harry .Thats what Dumbledore told us to do .Maybe .maybe we should forget about this Hallows business .Thank you Ron said Hermione .Ill take first watch .And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop .But Harry hardly slept that night .The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind the wand the stone and the Cloak if he could just possess them all .I open at the close .But what was ‘the close ?Why couldnt he have the stone now ?If only he had the stone he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person .and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness trying everything even Parseltongue but the golden ball would not open .And the wand the Elder Wand where was that hidden ?Where was Voldemort searching now ?Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemorts thoughts because for the first time ever he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing .Hermione would not like that idea of course .But then she did not believe .Xenophilius had been right in a way .Limited .Narrow .Closeminded .The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows especially of the Resurrection Stone .and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch kissing it nearly swallowing it but the cold metal did not yield .It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna alone in a cell in Azkaban surrounded by dementors and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself .He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows .If only they could rescue her but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable .Now he came to think about it he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand .He must try that in the morning .If only there was a way of getting a better wand .And desire for the Elder Wand the Deathstick unbeatable invincible swallowed him once more .They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain .The downpour pursued them to the coast where they pitched the tent that night and persisted through the whole week through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing .He could think only of the Deathly Hallows .It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing not Hermione s flat disbelief nor Rons persistent doubts could extinguish .And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him the less joyful it made him .He blamed Ron and Hermione Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits but neither could erode his certainty which remained absolute .Harrys belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes .Obsession ?said Hermione in a low fierce voice when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes .Were not the ones with an obsession Harry !Were the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do !But he was impervious to the veiled criticism .Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher and he had also Harry remained convinced of it left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch .Neither can live while the other survives .master of Death .Why didnt Ron and Hermione understand ? ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death Harry quoted calmly .I thought it was YouKnowWho we were supposed to be fighting ?Hermione retorted and Harry gave up on her .Even the mystery of the silver doe which the other two insisted on discussing seemed less important to Harry now a vaguely interesting sideshow .The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two .He sought solitude whenever it happened but was disappointed by what he saw .The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality they had become blurred shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus .Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance .Used to images sharp as reality Harry was disconcerted by the change .He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged a connection that he both feared and whatever he had told Hermione prized .Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying vague images with the destruction of his wand as if it was the blackthorn wands fault that he could no longer see into Voldemorts mind as well as before .As the weeks crept on Harry could not help but notice even through his new selfabsorption that Ron seemed to be taking charge .Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them perhaps because Harrys descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action .Three Horcruxes left he kept saying .We need a plan of action come on !Where havent we looked ?Lets go through it again .The orphanage .Diagon Alley Hogwarts the Riddle House Borgin and Burkes Albania every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked visited or murdered Ron and Hermione raked over them again Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him .He would have been happy to sit alone in silence trying to read Voldemorts thoughts to find out more about the Elder Wand but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply Harry was aware to keep them moving .You never know was Rons constant refrain .Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village he mightve wanted to live there .Lets go and have a poke around .These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers .Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters said Ron .The lot that got me were a bit pathetic but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous .They said on Potterwatch On what ?said Harry .Potterwatch didnt I tell you thats what it was called ?The program I keep trying to get on the radio the only one that tells the truth about whats going on !Nearly all the programs are following YouKnow Whos line all except Potterwatch .I really want you to hear it but its tricky tuning in .Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled .Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox and once a few bars of A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love .While he tapped Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password muttering strings of random words under his breath .Theyre normally something to do with the Order he told them .Bill had a real knack for guessing them .Im bound to get one in the end .But not until March did luck favor Ron at last .Harry was sitting in the tent entrance on guard duty staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent .Ive got it Ive got it !Password was Altars !Get in here Harry !Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio .Hermione who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do was sitting openmouthed staring at the tiny speaker from which a most familiar voice was issuing . .apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters .But thats Lee Jordan !said Hermione .I know !beamed Ron .Cool eh ? .now found ourselves another secure location Lee was saying and Im pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening .Evening boys !Hi .Evening River . ‘River thats Lee Ron explained .Theyve all got code names but you can usually tell Shh !said Hermione .But before we hear from Royal and Romulus Lee went on lets take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet dont think important enough to mention .It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell .Harry felt a sick swooping in his belly .He Ron and Hermione gazed at one another in horror .A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed .It is believed that Muggleborn Dean Thomas and a second goblin both believed to have been traveling with Tonks Cresswell and Gornuk may have escaped .If Dean is listening or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts his parents and sisters are desperate for news .Meanwhile in Gaddley a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home .Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse more evidence as if it were needed of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime .Finally we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godrics Hollow .The evidence is that she died several months ago .The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic .Listeners Id like to invite you now to join us in a minutes silence in memory of Ted Tonks Dirk Cresswell Bathilda Bagshot Gornuk and the unnamed but no less regretted Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters .Silence fell and Harry Ron and Hermione did not speak .Half of Harry yearned to hear more half of him was afraid of what might come next .It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time .Thank you said Lees voice .And now we turn to regular contributor Royal for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world .Thanks River said an unmistakable voice deep measured reassuring .Kingsley !burst out Ron .We know !said Hermione hushing him .Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties said Kingsley .However we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors often without the Muggles knowledge .Id like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street .Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken .And what would you say Royal to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times it should be Wizards first ?asked Lee .Id say that its one short step from Wizards first to ‘Purebloods first and then to ‘Death Eaters replied Kingsley .Were all human arent we ?Every human life is worth the same and worth saving .Excellently put Royal and youve got my vote for Minister of Magic if ever we get out of this mess said Lee .And now over to Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals of Potter .Thanks River said another very familiar voice Ron started to speak but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper .We know its Lupin Romulus do you maintain as you have every time youve appeared on our program that Harry Potter is still alive ?I do said Lupin firmly .There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime .The Boy Who Lived remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting the triumph of good the power of innocence the need to keep resisting .A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry .Had Lupin forgiven him then for the terrible things he had said when they had last met ?And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening Romulus ?Id tell him were all with him in spirit said Lupin then hesitated slightly .And Id tell him to follow his instincts which are good and nearly always right .Harry looked at Hermione whose eyes were full of tears .Nearly always right she repeated .Oh didnt I tell you ?said Ron in surprise .Bill told me Lupins living with Tonks again !And apparently shes getting pretty big too . .and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potters who are suffering for their allegiance ?Lee was saying .Well as regular listeners will know several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned including Xenophilius Lovegood erstwhile editor of The Quibbler said Lupin .At least hes still alive !muttered Ron .We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid all three of them gasped and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence wellknown gamekeeper at Hogwarts School has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter party in his house .However Hagrid was not taken into custody and is we believe on the run .I suppose it helps when escaping from Death Eaters if youve got a sixteenfoothigh half brother ?asked Lee .It would tend to give you an edge agreed Lupin gravely .May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrids spirit we would urge even the most devoted of Harrys supporters against following Hagrids lead . ‘Support Harry Potter parties are unwise in the present climate .Indeed they are Romulus said Lee so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to PotterwatcM And now lets move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter .We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him Id like to introduce a new correspondent Rodent . ‘Rodent ?said yet another familiar voice and Harry Ron and Hermione cried out together Fred !No is it George ?Its Fred I think said Ron leaning in closer as whichever twin it was said Im not being ‘Rodent no way I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier !Oh all right then . ‘Rapier could you please give us your take on the various stories weve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater ?Yes River I can said Fred .As our listeners will know unless theyve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar YouKnowWhos strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic .Mind you if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine we must have a good nineteen YouKnowWhos running around the place .Which suits him of course said Kingsley .The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself .Agreed said Fred .So people lets try and calm down a bit .Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well .For instance this new idea that You KnowWho can kill with a single glance from his eyes .Thats a basilisk listeners .One simple test Check whether the thing thats glaring at you has got legs .If it has its safe to look into its eyes although if it really is YouKnowWho thats still likely to be the last thing you ever do .For the first time in weeks and weeks Harry was laughing He could feel the weight of tension leaving him .And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad ?asked Lee .Well who wouldnt want a nice little holiday after all the hard work hes been putting in ?asked Fred .Point is people dont get lulled into a false sense of security thinking hes out of the country .Maybe he is maybe he isnt but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to so dont count on him being a long way away if youre planning on taking any risks .I never thought Id hear myself say it but safety first !Thank you very much for those wise words Rapier said Lee .Listeners that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch .We dont know when it will be possible to broadcast again but you can be sure we shall be back .Keep twiddling those dials The next password will be ‘MadEye .Keep each other safe Keep faith .Good night .The radios dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out .Harry Ron and Hermione were still beaming .Hearing familiar friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort .It was like waking from a long sleep .Good eh ?said Ron happily .Brilliant said Harry .Its so brave of them sighed Hermione admiringly .If they were found .Well they keep on the move dont they ?said Ron .Like us .But did you hear what Fred said ?asked Harry excitedly now the broadcast was over his thoughts turned again toward his allconsuming obsession .Hes abroad !Hes still looking for the Wand I knew it !Harry Come on Hermione why are you so determined not to admit it ?Vol HARRY NO !demorts after the Elder Wand !The names Taboo !Ron bellowed leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent .I told you Harry I told you we cant say it anymore weve got to put the protection back around us quickly its how they find But Ron stopped talking and Harry knew why .The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer rough excited voices .Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it Their lamps went out .Come out of there with your hands up !came a rasping voice through the darkness .We know youre in there !Youve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we dont care who we curse !MALFOY MANOR Harry looked around at the other two now mere outlines in the darkness .He saw Hermione point her wand not toward the outside but into his face there was a bang a burst of white light and he buckled in agony unable to see .He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him .Get up vermin .Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground .Before he could stop them someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand .Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers tight swollen and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction .His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too .Get off her !Ron shouted .There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed No !Leave him alone leave him alone !Your boyfriends going to have worse than that done to him if hes on my list said the horribly familiar rasping voice .Delicious girl .What a treat .I do enjoy the softness of the skin .Harrys stomach turned over .He knew who this was Fenrir Grey back the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery .Search the tent !said another voice .Harry was thrown facedown onto the ground .A thud told him that Ron had been cast down beside him .They could hear footsteps and crashes the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched .Now lets see who weve got said Greybacks gloating voice from overhead and Harry was rolled over onto his back .A beam of wandlight fell into his face and Grey back laughed .Ill be needing butterbeer to wash this one down .What happened to you ugly ?Harry did not answer immediately .I said repeated Greyback and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain what happened to you ?Stung Harry muttered .Been stung .Yeah looks like it said a second voice .Whats your name ?snarled Greyback .Dudley said Harry .And your first name ?I Vernon .Vernon Dudley .Check the list Scabior said Greyback and Harry heard him move sideways to look down at Ron instead .And what about you ginger ?Stan Shunpike said Ron .Like ell you are said the man called Scabior .We know Stan Shunpike es put a bit of work our way .There was another thud .Ib Bardy said Ron and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood .Bardy Weadley .A Weasley ?rasped Greyback .So youre related to blood traitors even if youre not a Mudblood .And lastly your pretty little friend .The relish in his voice made Harrys flesh crawl .Easy Greyback said Scabior over the jeering of the others .Oh Im not going to bite just yet .Well see if shes a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny .Who are you girly ?Penelope Clearwater said Hermione .She sounded terrified but convincing .Whats your blood status ?Halfblood said Hermione .Easy enough to check said Scabior .But the ole lot of em look like they could still be ogwarts age Weh lebt said Ron .Left ave you ginger ?said Scabior .And you decided to go camping ?And you thought just for a laugh youd use the Dark Lords name ?Nod a laugh said Ron .Aggiden .Accident ?There was more jeering laughter .You know who used to like using the Dark Lords name Weasley ?growled Greyback .The Order of the Phoenix .Mean anything to you ?Doh .Well they dont show the Dark Lord proper respect so the names been Tabooed .A few Order members have been tracked that way .Well see .Bind them up with the other two prisoners !Someone yanked Harry up by the hair dragged him a short way pushed him down into a sitting position then started binding him backtoback with other people .Harry was still half blind barely able to see anything through his puffedup eyes .When at last the man tying them had walked away Harry whispered to the other prisoners .Anyone still got a wand ?No said Ron and Hermione from either side of him .This is all my fault .I said the name Im sorry Harry ?It was a new but familiar voice and it came from directly behind Harry from the person tied to Hermiones left .Dean ?It is you !If they find out who theyve got !Theyre Snatchers theyre only looking for truants to sell for gold Not a bad little haul for one night Greyback was saying as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent .A Mudblood a runaway goblin and three truants .You checked their names on the list yet Scabior ?he roared .Yeah .Theres no Vernon Dudley on ere Greyback .Interesting said Greyback .Thats interesting .He crouched down beside Harry who saw through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth .Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died of dirt sweat and blood .So you arent wanted then Vernon ?Or are you on that list under a different name ?What House were you in at Hogwarts ?Slytherin said Harry automatically .Funny ow they all thinks we wants to ear that jeered Scabior out of the shadows .But none of em can tell us where the common room is .Its in the dungeons said Harry clearly .You enter through the wall .Its full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake so the lights all green .There was a short pause .Well well looks like we really ave caught a little Slytherin said Scabior .Good for you Vernon cause there aint a lot of Mudblood Slytherins .Whos your father ?He works at the Ministry Harry lied .He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation but on the other hand he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case .Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes .You know what Greyback said Scabior .I think there is a Dudley in there .Harry could barely breathe Could luck sheer luck get them safely out of this ?Well well said Greyback and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official .Harrys heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it .If youre telling the truth ugly youve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry .I expect your fatherll reward us just for picking you up .But said Harry his mouth bone dry if you just let us Hey !came a shout from inside the tent .Look at this Greyback !A dark figure came bustling toward them and Harry saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands .They had found Gryffindors sword .Veery nice said Greyback appreciatively taking it from his companion .Oh very nice indeed .Looks goblinmade that .Where did you get something like this ?Its my fathers Harry lied hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt .We borrowed it to cut firewood ang on a minute Greyback !Look at this in the Propheti As Scabior said it Harrys scar which was stretched tight across his distended forehead burned savagely .More clearly than he could make out anything around him he saw a towering building a grim fortress jet black and forbidding Voldemorts thoughts had suddenly become razorsharp again he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose .So close .So close .With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemorts thoughts pulling himself back to where he sat tied to Ron Hermione Dean and Griphook in the darkness listening to Greyback and Scabior . ‘ermione Granger Scabior was saying ‘the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with arry Potter .Harrys scar burned in the silence but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present not to slip into Voldemorts mind .He heard the creak of Greybacks boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione .You know what little girly ?This picture looks a hell of a lot like you .It isnt !It isnt me !Hermione s terrified squeak was as good as a confession . ‘.known to be traveling with Harry Potter repeated Grey back quietly .A stillness had settled over the scene .Harrys scar was exquisitely painful but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemorts thoughts It had never been so important to remain in his own right mind .Well this changes things doesnt it ?whispered Greyback .Nobody spoke Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching frozen and felt Hermione s arm trembling against his .Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features .Whats that on your forehead Vernon ?he asked softly his breath foul in Harrys nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar .Dont touch it !Harry yelled he could not stop himself he thought he might be sick from the pain of it .I thought you wore glasses Potter ?breathed Greyback .I found glasses !yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background .There was glasses in the tent Greyback wait And seconds later Harrys glasses had been rammed back onto his face .The Snatchers were closing in now peering at him .It is !rasped Greyback .Weve caught Potter !They all took several steps backward stunned by what they had done .Harry still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head could think of nothing to say Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress No he was Harry tied up and wandless in grave danger looking up up to the topmost window the highest tower He was Harry and they were discussing his fate in low voices Time to fly . .to the Ministry ?To hell with the Ministry growled Greyback .Theyll take the credit and we wont get a look in .I say we take him straight to YouKnowWho .Will you summon im ?ere ?said Scabior sounding awed terrified .No snarled Greyback I havent got they say hes using the Malfoys place as a base .Well take the boy there .Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort .The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him but only Voldemorts inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark Greyback had not been granted this highest honor .Harrys scar seared again and he rose into the night flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower .completely sure its him ?Cause if it aint Greyback were dead .Whos in charge here ?roared Greyback covering his moment of inadequacy .I say thats Potter and him plus his wand thats two hundred thousand Galleons right there !But if youre too gutless to come along any of you its all for me and with any luck Ill get the girl thrown in !The window was the merest slit in the black rock not big enough for a man to enter .A skeletal figure was just visible through it curled beneath a blanket .Dead or sleeping . ?All right !said Scabior .All right were in !And what about the rest of em Greyback whatll we do with em ?Might as well take the lot .Weve got two Mudbloods thats another ten Galleons .Give me the sword as well .If theyre rubies thats another small fortune right there .The prisoners were dragged to their feet .Harry could hear Hermiones breathing fast and terrified .Grab hold and make it tight .Ill do Potter !said Greyback seizing a fistful of Harrys hair Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp .On three !One two three They Disapparated pulling the prisoners with them .Harry struggled trying to throw off Greybacks hand but it was hopeless Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side he could not separate from the group and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed lightly as vapor inside the celllike room The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane .Harrys eyes still puffy took a moment to acclimatize then he saw a pair of wroughtiron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive .He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief .The worst had not happened yet Voldemort was not here .He was Harry knew for he was fighting to resist the vision in some strange fortresslike place at the top of a tower .How long it would take Voldemort to get to this place once he knew that Harry was here was another matter .One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them .How do we get in ?Theyre locked Greyback I cant blimey !He whipped his hands away in fright .The iron was contorting twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face which spoke in a clanging echoing voice State your purpose !Weve got Potter !Greyback roared triumphantly .Weve captured Harry Potter !The gates swung open .Come on !said Greyback to his men and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive between high hedges that muffled their footsteps .Harry saw a ghostly white shape above him and realized it was an albino peacock .He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback now he was staggering along sideways tied backto back to the four other prisoners .Closing his puffy eyes he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment wanting to know what Voldemort was doing whether he knew yet that Harry was caught .The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him eyes opening in a skull of a face .The frail man sat up great sunken eyes fixed upon him upon Voldemort and then he smiled .Most of his teeth were gone .So you have come .I thought you would .one day .But your journey was pointless .I never had it .You lie As Voldemorts anger throbbed inside him Harrys scar threatened to burst with pain and he wrenched his mind back to his own body fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel .Light spilled out over all of them .What is this ?said a womans cold voice .Were here to see HeWhoMustNotBeNamed !rasped Greyback .Who are you ?You know me !There was resentment in the werewolfs voice .Fenrir Greyback !Weve caught Harry Potter !Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too .I know es swollen maam but its im !piped up Scabior .If you look a bit closer youll see is scar .And this ere see the girl ?The Mudblood whos been traveling around with im maam .Theres no doubt its im and weve got is wand as well !Ere maam Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face .Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her .She raised her eyebrows .Bring them in she said .Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits .Follow me said Narcissa leading the way across the hall .My son Draco is home for his Easter holidays .If that is Harry Potter he will know .The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room .A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling more portraits against the dark purple walls .Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers .What is this ?The dreadfully familiar drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harrys ears .He was panicking now He could see no way out and it was easier as his fear mounted to block out Voldemorts thoughts though his scar was still burning .They say theyve got Potter said Narcissas cold voice .Draco come here .Harry did not dare look directly at Draco but saw him obliquely a figure slightly taller than he was rising from an armchair his face a pale and pointed blur beneath whiteblond hair .Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier .Well boy ?rasped the werewolf .Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame .Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place .His face was huge shiny and pink every feature distorted by Hermiones jinx .His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw .Had he not known that it was he who stood there he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses .He resolved not to speak for his voice was sure to give him away yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached .Well Draco ?said Lucius Malfoy .He sounded avid .Is it ?Is it Harry Potter ?I cant I cant be sure said Draco .He was keeping his distance from Greyback and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him .But look at him carefully look !Come closer !Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited .Draco if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord everything will be forgiv Now we wont be forgetting who actually caught him I hope Mr Malfoy ?said Greyback menacingly .Of course not of course not !said Lucius impatiently .He approached Harry himself came so close that Harry could see the usually languid pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes .With his face a puffy mask Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage .What did you do to him ?Lucius asked Greyback .How did he get into this state ?That wasnt us .Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me said Lucius .His gray eyes raked Harrys forehead .Theres something there he whispered it could be the scar stretched tight .Draco come here look properly !What do you think ?Harry saw Dracos face up close now right beside his fathers .They were extraordinarily alike except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement Dracos expression was full of reluctance even fear .I dont know he said and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching .We had better be certain Lucius Narcissa called to her husband in her cold clear voice .Completely sure that it is Potter before we summon the Dark Lord .They say this is his she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand but it does not resemble Ollivanders description .If we are mistaken if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing .Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov ?What about the Mudblood then ?growled Greyback .Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again so that the light fell on Hermione instead .Wait said Narcissa sharply .Yes yes she was in Madam Malkins with Potter !I saw her picture in the Prophett Look Draco isnt it the Granger girl ?I .maybe .yeah .But then thats the Weasley boy !shouted Lucius striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron .Its them Potters friends Draco look at him isnt it Arthur Weasleys son whats his name ?Yeah said Draco again his back to the prisoners .It could be .The drawing room door opened behind Harry .A woman spoke and the sound of the voice wound Harrys fear to an even higher pitch .What is this ?Whats happened Cissy ?Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners and stopped on Harrys right staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes .But surely she said quietly this is the Mudblood girl ?This is Granger ?Yes yes its Granger !cried Lucius .And beside her we think Potter !Potter and his friends caught at last !Potter ?shrieked Bellatrix and she backed away the better to take in Harry .Are you sure ?Well then the Dark Lord must be informed at once !She dragged back her left sleeve Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm and knew that she was about to touch it to summon her beloved master I was about to call him !said Lucius and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrixs wrist preventing her from touching the Mark .I shall summon him Bella Potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority Your authority !she sneered attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp .You lost your authority when you lost your wand Lucius !How dare you !Take your hands off me !This is nothing to do with you you did not capture the boy Begging your pardon Mr Malfoy interjected Greyback but its us that caught Potter and its us that 11 be claiming the gold Gold !laughed Bellatrix still attempting to throw off her brotherinlaw her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand .Take your gold filthy scavenger what do I want with gold ?I seek only the honor of his of She stopped struggling her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see .Jubilant at her capitulation Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve STOP !shrieked Bellatrix .Do not touch it we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now !Lucius froze his index finger hovering over his own Mark .Bellatrix strode out of Harrys limited line of vision .What is that ?he heard her say .Sword grunted an outofsight Snatcher .Give it to me .Its not yorn missus its mine I reckon I found it .There was a bang and a flash of red light Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned .There was a roar of anger from his fellows Scabior drew his wand .What dyou think youre playing at woman ?Stupefyl she screamed .Stupefyl They were no match for her even though there were four of them against one of her She was a witch as Harry knew with prodigious skill and no conscience .They fell where they stood all except Greyback who had been forced into a kneeling position his arms outstretched .Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand her face waxen .Where did you get this sword ?she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip .How dare you ?he snarled his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her .He bared his pointed teeth .Release me woman !Where did you find this sword ?she repeated brandishing it in his face .Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts !It was in their tent rasped Greyback .Release me I say !She waved her wand and the werewolf sprang to his feet but appeared too wary to approach her .He prowled behind an armchair his filthy curved nails clutching its back .Draco move this scum outside said Bellatrix indicating the unconscious men .If you havent got the guts to finish them then leave them in the courtyard for me .Dont you dare speak to Draco like said Narcissa furiously but Bellatrix screamed Be quiet !The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine Cissy !We have a very serious problem !She stood panting slightly looking down at the sword examining its hilt .Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners .If it is indeed Potter he must not be harmed she muttered more to herself than to the others .The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself .But if he finds out .I must .I must know .She turned back to her sister again .The prisoners must be placed in the cellar while I think what to do !This is my house Bella you dont give orders in my Do it !You have no idea of the danger we are in !shrieked Bellatrix .She looked frightening mad a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet .Narcissa hesitated for a moment then addressed the werewolf .Take these prisoners down to the cellar Greyback .Wait said Bellatrix sharply .All except .except for the Mudblood .Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure .No !shouted Ron .You can have me keep me !Bellatrix hit him across the face the blow echoed around the room .If she dies under questioning Ill take you next she said .Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book .Take them downstairs Greyback and make sure they are secure but do nothing more to them yet .She threw Greybacks wand back to him then took a short silver knife from under her robes .She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door into a dark passageway his wand held out in front of him projecting an invisible and irresistible force .Reckon shell let me have a bit of the girl when shes finished with her ?Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor .Id say Ill get a bite or two wouldnt you ginger ?Harry could feel Ron shaking .They were forced down a steep flight of stairs still tied backtoback and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment .At the bottom was a heavy door .Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness .The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible drawnout scream from directly above them .HERMIONE !Ron bellowed and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together so that Harry staggered .HERMIONE !Be quiet !Harry said .Shut up Ron we need to work out a way HERMIONE !HERMIONE !We need a plan stop yelling we need to get these ropes off Harry ?came a whisper through the darkness .Ron ?Is that you ?Ron stopped shouting .There was a sound of movement close by them then Harry saw a shadow moving closer .Harry ?Ron ?Luna ?Yes its me !Oh no I didnt want you to be caught !Luna can you help us get these ropes off ?said Harry .Oh yes I expect so .Theres an old nail we use if we need to break anything .Just a moment .Hermione screamed again from overhead and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too but her words were inaudible for Ron shouted again HERMIONE !HERMIONE !Mr Ollivander ?Harry could hear Luna saying .Mr Ollivander have you got the nail ?If you just move over a little bit .I think it was beside the water jug .She was back within seconds .Youll need to stay still she said .Harry could feel her digging at the ropes tough fibers to work the knots free .From upstairs they heard Bellatrixs voice .Im going to ask you again !Where did you get this sword ?Where ?We found it we found it PLEASE !Hermione screamed again Ron struggled harder than ever and the rusty nail slipped onto Harrys wrist .Ron please stay still !Luna whispered .I cant see what Im doing My pocket !said Ron .In my pocket theres a Deluminator and its full of light !A few seconds later there was a click and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar Unable to rejoin their sources they simply hung there like tiny suns flooding the underground room with light .Harry saw Luna all eyes in her white face and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker curled up on the floor in the corner .Craning around he caught sight of their fellow prisoners Dean and Griphook the goblin who seemed barely conscious kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans .Oh thats much easier thanks Ron said Luna and she began hacking at their bindings again .Hello Dean !From above came Bellatrixs voice .You are lying filthy Mudblood and I know it !You have been inside my vault at Gringotts !Tell the truth tell the truth Another terrible scream HERMIONE !What else did you take ?What else have you got ?Tell me the truth or I swear I shall run you through with this knife !There !Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned rubbing his wrists to see Ron running around the cellar looking up at the low ceiling searching for a trapdoor .Dean his face bruised and bloody said Thanks to Luna and stood there shivering but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor looking groggy and disoriented many welts across his swarthy face .Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand .Theres no way out Ron said Luna watching his fruitless efforts .The cellar is completely escape proof .I tried at first .Mr Ollivander has been here for a long time hes tried everything .Hermione was screaming again The sound went through Harry like physical pain .Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar he too started to run around the cellar feeling the walls for he hardly knew what knowing in his heart that it was useless .What else did you take what else ?ANSWER ME !CRUCIO Hermione s screams echoed off the walls upstairs Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrids pouch from around his neck and groped inside it He pulled out Dumbledores Snitch and shook it hoping for he did not know what nothing happened he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand but they were lifeless the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor and he saw a gleam of brightest blue Dumbledores eye was gazing at him out of the mirror .Help us !he yelled at it in mad desperation .Were in the cellar of Malfoy Manor help us !The eye blinked and was gone .Harry was not even sure that it had really been there .He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever and next to him Ron was bellowing HERMIONE !HERMIONE !How did you get into my vault ?they heard Bellatrix scream .Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you ?We only met him tonight !Hermione sobbed .Weve never been inside your vault .It isnt the real sword !Its a copy just a copy !A copy ?screeched Bellatrix .Oh a likely story !But we can find out easily !came Luciuss voice .Draco fetch the goblin he can tell us whether the sword is real or not !Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor .Griphook he whispered into the goblins pointed ear you must tell them that swords a fake they mustnt know its the real one Griphook please He could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps next moment Dracos shaking voice spoke from behind the door .Stand back .Line up against the back wall .Dont try anything or Ill kill you !They did as they were bidden as the lock turned Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket restoring the cellars darkness .The door flew open Malfoy marched inside wand held out in front of him pale and determined .He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again dragging Griphook with him .The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar .Ron clicked the Deluminator .Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket revealing Dobby the houseelf who had just Apparated into their midst .DOB !Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting and Ron looked terrified at his mistake .Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix .Dobbys enormous tennisballshaped eyes were wide he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears .He was back in the home of his old masters and it was clear that he was petrified .Harry Potter he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice Dobby has come to rescue you .But how did you ?An awful scream drowned Harrys words Hermione was being tortured again .He cut to the essentials .You can Disapparate out of this cellar ?he asked Dobby who nodded his ears flapping .And you can take humans with you ?Dobby nodded again .Right .Dobby I want you to grab Luna Dean and Mr Ollivander and take them take them to Bill and Fleurs said Ron .Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth !The elf nodded for a third time .And then come back said Harry .Can you do that Dobby ?Of course Harry Potter whispered the little elf .He hurried over to Mr Ollivander who appeared to be barely conscious .He took one of the wandmakers hands in his own then held out the other to Luna and Dean neither of whom moved .Harry we want to help you !Luna whispered .We cant leave you here said Dean .Go both of you !Well see you at Bill and Fleurs .As Harry spoke his scar burned worse than ever and for a few seconds he looked down not upon the wandmaker but on another man who was just as old just as thin but laughing scornfully .Kill me then Voldemort I welcome death !But my death will not bring you what you seek .There is so much you do not understand .He felt Voldemorts fury but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present .Go !Harry beseeched Luna and Dean .Go !Well follow just go !They caught hold of the elfs outstretched fingers .There was another loud crack and Dobby Luna Dean and Ollivander vanished .What was that ?shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads .Did you hear that ?What was that noise in the cellar ?Harry and Ron stared at each other .Draco no call Wormtail !Make him go and check !Footsteps crossed the room overhead then there was silence .Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar .Were going to have to try and tackle him he whispered to Ron .They had no choice The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners they were lost .Leave the lights on Harry added and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door they backed against the wall on either side of it .Stand back came Wormtails voice .Stand away from the door .I am coming in .The door flew open .For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair .Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him .Ron seized Wormtails wand arm and forced it upward Harry slapped a hand to his mouth muffling his voice .Silently they struggled Wormtails wand emitted sparks his silver hand closed around Harrys throat .What is it Wormtail ?called Lucius Malfoy from above .Nothing !Ron called back in a passable imitation of Wormtails wheezy voice .All fine !Harry could barely breathe .Youre going to kill me ?Harry choked attempting to prise off the metal fingers .After I saved your life ?You owe me Wormtail !The silver fingers slackened .Harry had not expected it He wrenched himself free astonished keeping his hand over Wormtails mouth .He saw the ratlike mans small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done at the tiny merciful impulse it had betrayed and he continued to struggle more powerfully as though to undo that moment of weakness .And well have that whispered Ron tugging Wormtails wand from his other hand .Wandless helpless Pettigrews pupils dilated in terror .His eyes had slid from Harrys face to something else .His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat .No Without pausing to think Harry tried to drag back the hand but there was no stopping it .The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation his moment of pity he was being strangled before their eyes .No !Ron had released Wormtail too and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtails throat but it was no use .Pettigrew was turning blue .Relashiol said Ron pointing the wand at the silver hand but nothing happened Pettigrew dropped to his knees and at the same moment Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead .Wormtails eyes rolled upward in his purple face he gave a last twitch and was still .Harry and Ron looked at each other then leaving Wormtails body on the floor behind them ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room .Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door which was ajar .Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook who was holding Gryffindors sword in his longfingered hands .Hermione was lying at Bellatrixs feet .She was barely stirring .Well ?Bellatrix said to Griphook .Is it the true sword ?Harry waited holding his breath fighting against the prickling of his scar .No said Griphook .It is a fake .Are you sure ?panted Bellatrix .Quite sure ?Yes said the goblin .Relief broke across her face all tension drained from it .Good she said and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblins face and he dropped with a yell at her feet .She kicked him aside .And now she said in a voice that burst with triumph we call the Dark Lord !And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark .At once Harrys scar felt as though it had split open again .His true surroundings vanished He was Voldemort and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him he was enraged at the summons he felt he had warned them he had told them to summon him for nothing less than Potter .If they were mistaken .Kill me then !demanded the old man .You will not win you cannot win !That wand will never ever be yours And Voldemorts fury broke A burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back lifeless and Voldemort returned to the window his wrath barely controllable .They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back .And I think said Bellatrixs voice we can dispose of the Mudblood .Greyback take her if you want her .NOOOOOOOOOOOO !Ron had burst into the drawing room Bellatrix looked around shocked she turned her wand to face Ron instead ExpelliarmusV he roared pointing Wormtails wand at Bellatrix and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry who had sprinted after Ron .Lucius Narcissa Draco and Greyback wheeled about Harry yelled Stupefy and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth .Jets of light flew from Dracos Narcissas and Greybacks wands Harry threw himself to the floor rolling behind a sofa to avoid them .STOP OR SHE DIES !Panting Harry peered around the edge of the sofa .Bellatrix was supporting Hermione who seemed to be unconscious and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione s throat .Drop your wands she whispered .Drop them or well see exactly how filthy her blood is !Ron stood rigid clutching Wormtails wand .Harry straightened up still holding Bellatrixs .I said drop them !she screeched pressing the blade into Hermiones throat Harry saw beads of blood appear there .All right !he shouted and he dropped Bellatrixs wand onto the floor at his feet .Ron did the same with Wormtails .Both raised their hands to shoulder height .Good !she leered .Draco pick them up !The Dark Lord is coming Harry Potter !Your death approaches !Harry knew it his scar was bursting with the pain of it and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away over a dark and stormy sea and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them and Harry could see no way out .Now said Bellatrix softly as Draco hurried back to her with the wands Cissy I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood .I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl Greyback after what you have done tonight .At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above .All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble then with a creak and an ominous jingling it began to fall .Bellatrix was directly beneath it dropping Hermione she threw herself aside with a scream .The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains falling on top of Hermione and the goblin who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor .Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions Draco doubled over his hands covering his bloody face .As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage Harry took his chance He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Dracos grip pointed all of them at Greyback and yelled Stupefyl The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground .As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm Bellatrix sprang to her feet her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway .Dobby !she screamed and even Bellatrix froze .You !You dropped the chandelier ?The tiny elf trotted into the room his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress .You must not hurt Harry Potter he squeaked .Kill him Cissy !shrieked Bellatrix but there was another loud crack and Narcissas wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room .You dirty little monkey !bawled Bellatrix .How dare you take a witchs wand how dare you defy your masters ?Dobby has no master !squealed the elf .Dobby is a free elf and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends !Harrys scar was blinding him with pain .Dimly he knew that they had moments seconds before Voldemort was with them .Ron catch and GO !he yelled throwing one of the wands to him then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier .Hoisting the groaning goblin who still clung to the sword over one shoulder Harry seized Dobbys hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate .As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco of the streak of red that was Rons hair and a blur of flying silver as Bellatrixs knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing Bill and Fleurs .Shell Cottage .Bill and Fleurs .He had disappeared into the unknown all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there .The pain in his forehead pierced him and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him he could feel the blade of Gryffindors sword bumping against his back Dobbys hand jerked in his he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge to pull them in the right direction and tried by squeezing the fingers to indicate that that was fine with him .And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air .Harry fell to his knees relinquished Dobbys hand and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground .Are you all right ?he said as the goblin stirred but Griphook merely whimpered .Harry squinted around through the darkness .There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky and he thought he saw movement outside it .Dobby is this Shell Cottage ?he whispered clutching the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys ready to fight if he needed to .Have we come to the right place ?Dobby ?He looked around .The little elf stood feet from him .DOBBY !The elf swayed slightly stars reflected in his wide shining eyes .Together he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elfs heaving chest .Dobby no HELP !Harry bellowed toward the cottage toward the people moving there .HELP !He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles friends or foes all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobbys front and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication .Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass .Dobby no dont die dont die The elfs eyes found him and his lips trembled with the effort to form words .Harry .Potter .And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see .THE WANDMAKER It was like sinking into an old nightmare for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledores body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass pierced by Bellatrixs silver knife .Harrys voice was still saying Dobby .Dobby .even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back .After a minute or so he realized that they had after all come to the right place for here were Bill and Fleur Dean and Luna gathering around him as he knelt over the elf .Hermione ?he said suddenly .Where is she ?Rons taken her inside said Bill .Shell be all right .Harry looked back down at Dobby .He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elfs body then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket .The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby Harry listened to it while the others talked discussing matters in which he could take no interest making decisions .Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house Fleur hurrying with them now Bill was making suggestions about burying the elf .Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying .As he did so he gazed down at the tiny body and his scar prickled and burned and in one part of his mind viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor .His rage was dreadful and yet Harrys grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast silent ocean .I want to do it properly were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking .Not by magic .Have you got a spade ?And shortly afterward he had set to work alone digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden between bushes .He dug with a kind of fury relishing the manual work glorying in the nonmagic of it for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives .His scar burned but he was master of the pain he felt it yet was apart from it .He had learned control at last learned to shut his mind to Voldemort the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape .Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby .Grief it seemed drove Voldemort out .though Dumbledore of course would have said that it was love .On Harry dug deeper and deeper into the hard cold earth subsuming his grief in sweat denying the pain in his scar .In the darkness with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company the things that had happened at the Malfoys returned to him the things he had heard came back to him and understanding blossomed in the darkness .The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts .Hallows .Horcruxes .Hallows .Horcruxes .Yet he no longer burned with that weird obsessive longing .Loss and fear had snuffed it out He felt as though he had been slapped awake again .Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard and why .And he thought of Wormtail dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy .Dumbledore had foreseen that .How much more had he known ?Harry lost track of time .He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean .Hows Hermione ?Better said Ron .Fleurs looking after her .Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand but he did not need it .They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough .Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket .Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks which he placed upon the elfs bare feet .Dean produced a woolen hat which Harry placed carefully upon Dobbys head muffling his batlike ears .We should close his eyes .Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness .Bill was wearing a traveling cloak Fleur a large white apron from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be SkeleGro .Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown pale and unsteady on her feet Ron put an arm around her when she reached him .Luna who was huddled in one of Fleurs coats crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elfs eyelids sliding them over his glassy stare .There she said softly .Now he could be sleeping .Harry placed the elf into the grave arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body .He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledores funeral and the rows and rows of golden chairs and the Minister of Magic in the front row the recitation of Dumbledores achievements the stateliness of the white marble tomb .He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole .I think we ought to say something piped up Luna .Ill go first shall I ?And as everybody looked at her she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave .Thank you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar .Its so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave .Ill always remember what you did for us .I hope youre happy now .She turned and looked expectantly at Ron who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice Yeah .thanks Dobby .Thanks muttered Dean .Harry swallowed .Goodbye Dobby he said .It was all he could manage but Luna had said it all for him .Bill raised his wand and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it a small reddish mound .Dyou mind if I stay here a moment ?he asked the others .They murmured words he did not catch he felt gentle pats upon his back and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage leaving Harry alone beside the elf .He looked around There were a number of large white stones smoothed by the sea marking the edge of the flower beds .He picked up one of the largest and laid it pillowlike over the place where Dobby s head now rested .He then felt in his pocket for a wand .There were two in there .He had forgotten lost track he could not now remember whose wands these were he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someones hand .He selected the shorter of the two which felt friendlier in his hand and pointed it at the rock .Slowly under his murmured instruction deep cuts appeared upon the rocks surface .He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly and probably more quickly but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave .When Harry stood up again the stone read HERE LIES DOBBY A FREE ELF .He looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds then walked away his scar still prickling a little and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave ideas that had taken shape in the darkness ideas both fascinating and terrible .They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall their attention focused upon Bill who was talking .The room was lightcolored pretty with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace .Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet so he stood in the doorway listening . .lucky that Ginnys on holiday .If shed been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her .Now we know shes safe too .He looked around and saw Harry standing there .Ive been getting them all out of the Burrow he explained .Moved them to Muriels .The Death Eaters know Rons with you now theyre bound to target the family dont apologize he added at the sight of Harrys expression .It was always a matter of time Dads been saying so for months .Were the biggest bloodtraitor family there is .How are they protected ?asked Harry .Fidelius Charm .Dads SecretKeeper .And weve done it on this cottage too Im SecretKeeper here .None of us can go to work but thats hardly the most important thing now .Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough well move them to Muriels too .There isnt much room here but shes got plenty .Griphooks legs are on the mend Fleurs given him SkeleGro we could probably move them in an hour or No Harry said and Bill looked startled .I need both of them here .I need to talk to them .Its important .He heard the authority in his own voice the conviction the sense of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobbys grave .All of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled .Im going to wash Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered in mud and Dobbys blood .Then 111 need to see them straightaway .He walked into the little kitchen to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea .Dawn was breaking over the horizon shell pink and faintly gold as he washed again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden .Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar but Harry knew what he had seen .A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment and then help had come .Help will always be given at Hog warts to those who ask for it Harry dried his hands impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room .He looked out over the ocean and felt closer this dawn than ever before closer to the heart of it all .And still his scar prickled and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too .Harry understood and yet did not understand .His instinct was telling him one thing his brain quite another .The Dumbledore in Harrys head smiled surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers pressed together as if in prayer .You gave Ron the Deluminator .You understood him .You gave him a way back .And you understood Wormtail too .You knew there was a bit of regret there somewhere .And if you knew them .What did you know about me Dumbledore ?Am I meant to know but not to seek ?Did you know how hard Id find that ?Is that why you made it this difficult ?So Id have time to work that out ?Harry stood quite still eyes glazed watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon .Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them .He set it down and returned to the hall and as he did so he felt his scar pulse angrily and there flashed across his mind swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water the outline of a building he knew extremely well .Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs .I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander Harry said .No said Fleur .You will ave to wait Arry .Zey are both ill tired Im sorry he said without heat but it cant wait .I need to talk to them now .Privately and separately .Its urgent .Harry what the hells going on ?asked Bill .You turn up here with a dead houseelf and a half conscious goblin Hermione looks as though shes been tortured and Rons just refused to tell me anything We cant tell you what were doing said Harry flatly .Youre in the Order Bill you know Dumbledore left us a mission .Were not supposed to talk about it to anyone else .Fleur made an impatient noise but Bill did not look at her he was staring at Harry .His deeply scarred face was hard to read .Finally Bill said All right .Who do you want to talk to first ?Harry hesitated .He knew what hung on his decision .There was hardly any time left now was the moment to decide Horcruxes or Hallows ?Griphook Harry said .Ill speak to Griphook first .His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle .Up here then said Bill leading the way .Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back .I need you two as well !he called to Ron and Hermione who had been skulking half concealed in the doorway of the sitting room .They both moved into the light looking oddly relieved .How are you ?Harry asked Hermione .You were amazing coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one armed squeeze .What are we doing now Harry ?he asked .Youll see .Come on .Harry Ron and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing .Three doors led off it .In here said Bill opening the door into his and Fleurs room .It too had a view of the sea now flecked with gold in the sunrise .Harry moved to the window turned his back on the spectacular view and waited his arms folded his scar prickling .Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table Ron sat on the arm .Bill reappeared carrying the little goblin whom he set down carefully upon the bed .Griphook grunted thanks and Bill left closing the door upon them all .Im sorry to take you out of bed said Harry .How are your legs ?Painful replied the goblin .But mending .He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor and wore a strange look half truculent half intrigued .Harry noted the goblins sallow skin his long thin fingers his black eyes .Fleur had removed his shoes His long feet were dirty .He was larger than a house elf but not by much .His domed head was much bigger than a humans .You probably dont remember Harry began .that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault the first time you ever visited Gringotts ?said Griphook .I remember Harry Potter .Even amongst goblins you are very famous .Harry and the goblin looked at each other sizing each other up .Harrys scar was still prickling .He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly and at the same time was afraid of making a false move .While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request the goblin broke the silence .You buried the elf he said sounding unexpectedly rancorous .I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door .Yes said Harry .Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes .You are an unusual wizard Harry Potter .In what way ?asked Harry rubbing his scar absently .You dug the grave .So ?Griphook did not answer .Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle but it did not much matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobbys grave or not .He gathered himself for the attack .Griphook I need to ask You also rescued a goblin .What ?You brought me here .Saved me .Well I take it youre not sorry ?said Harry a little impatiently .No Harry Potter said Griphook and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin but you are a very odd wizard .Right said Harry .Well I need some help Griphook and you can give it to me .The goblin made no sign of encouragement but continued to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him .I need to break into a Gringotts vault .Harry had not meant to say it so baldly the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw again the outline of Hogwarts .He closed his mind firmly .He needed to deal with Griphook first .Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad .Harry said Hermione but she was cut off by Griphook .Break into a Gringotts vault ?repeated the goblin wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed .It is impossible .No it isnt Ron contradicted him .Its been done .Yeah said Harry .The same day I first met you Griphook .My birthday seven years ago .The vault in question was empty at the time snapped the goblin and Harry understood that even though Griphook had left Gringotts he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached .Its protection was minimal .Well the vault we need to get into isnt empty and Im guessing its protection will be pretty powerful said Harry .It belongs to the Lestranges .He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other astonished but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer .You have no chance said Griphook flatly .No chance at all .If you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours Thief you have been warned beware yeah I know I remember said Harry .But Im not trying to get myself any treasure Im not trying to take anything for personal gain .Can you believe that ?The goblin looked slantwise at Harry and the lightning scar on Harrys forehead prickled but he ignored it refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation .If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain said Griphook finally it would be you Harry Potter .Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night .Not from wand carriers .Wandcarriers repeated Harry The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door .The right to carry a wand said the goblin quietly has long been contested between wizards and goblins .Well goblins can do magic without wands said Ron .That is immaterial !Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings they deny us the possibility of extending our powers !Well goblins wont share any of their magic either said Ron .You wont tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do .Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never It doesnt matter said Harry noting Griphooks rising color .This isnt about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature Griphook gave a nasty laugh .But it is it is about precisely that !As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful your race is set still more firmly above mine !Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule houseelves are slaughtered and who amongst the wandcarriers protests ?We do !said Hermione .She had sat up straight her eyes bright .We protest !And Im hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf Griphook !Im a Mudblood !Dont call yourself Ron muttered .Why shouldnt I ?said Hermione .Mudblood and proud of it !Ive got no higher position under this new order than you have Griphook !It was me they chose to torture back at the Malfoys !As she spoke she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made scarlet against her throat .Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free ?she asked .Did you know that weve wanted elves to be freed for years ?Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermiones chair .You cant want You KnowWho defeated more than we do Griphook !The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry .What do you seek within the Lestranges vault ?he asked abruptly .The sword that lies inside it is a fake .This is the real one .He looked from one to the other of them .I think that you already know this .You asked me to lie for you back there .But the fake sword isnt the only thing in that vault is it ?asked Harry .Perhaps youve seen the other things in there ?His heart was pounding harder than ever .He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar .The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again .It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts .We are the guardians of fabulous treasures .We have a duty to the objects placed in our care which were so often wrought by our fingers .The goblin stroked the sword and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again .So young he said finally to be fighting so many .Will you help us ?said Harry .We havent got a hope of breaking in without a goblins help .Youre our one chance .I shall .think about it said Griphook maddeningly .But Ron started angrily Hermione nudged him in the ribs .Thank you said Harry .The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement then flexed his short legs .I think he said settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleurs bed that the SkeleGro has finished its work .I may be able to sleep at last .Forgive me .Yeah of course said Harry but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin .Griphook did not protest but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblins eyes as he closed the door upon him .Little git whispered Ron .Hes enjoying keeping us hanging .Harry whispered Hermione pulling them both away from the door into the middle of the stilldark landing are you saying what I think youre saying ?Are you saying theres a Horcrux in the Lestranges vault ?Yes said Harry .Bellatrix was terrified when she thought wed been in there she was beside herself .Why ?What did she think wed seen what else did she think we might have taken ?Something she was petrified YouKnowWho would find out about .But I thought we were looking for places YouKnow Whos been places hes done something important ?said Ron looking baffled .Was he ever inside the Lestranges vault ?I dont know whether he was ever inside Gringotts said Harry .He never had gold there when he was younger because nobody left him anything .He would have seen the bank from the outside though the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley .Harrys scar throbbed but he ignored it he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander .I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault .I think hed have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world .And dont forget he trusted Bellatrix and her husband .They were his most devoted servants before he fell and they went looking for him after he vanished .He said it the night he came back I heard him .Harry rubbed his scar .I dont think hed have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux though .He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary .He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault .The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide Hagrid told me .except for Hogwarts .When Harry had finished speaking Ron shook his head .You really understand him .Bits of him said Harry .Bits .I just wish Id understood Dumbledore as much .But well see .Come on Ollivander now .Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleurs .A weak Come in !answered them .The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window .He had been held in the cellar for more than a year and tortured Harry knew on at least one occasion .He was emaciated the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin .His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets .The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton .Harry sat down on the empty bed beside Ron and Hermione .The rising sun was not visible here .The room faced the cliff top garden and the freshly dug grave .Mr Ollivander Im sorry to disturb you Harry said .My dear boy .Ollivanders voice was feeble .You rescued us .I thought we would die in that place .I can never thank you .never thank you .enough .We were glad to do it .Harrys scar throbbed .He knew he was certain that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal or else to attempt to thwart him .He felt a flutter of panic .yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first .Feigning a calm he did not feel he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand .Mr Ollivander I need some help .Anything .Anything said the wandmaker weakly .Can you mend this ?Is it possible ?Ollivander held out a trembling hand and Harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm .Holly and phoenix feather said Ollivander in a tremulous voice .Eleven inches .Nice and supple .Yes said Harry .Can you ?No whispered Ollivander .I am sorry very sorry but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of .Harry had been braced to hear it but it was a blow nevertheless .He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck .Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys .Can you identify these ?Harry asked .The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes rolling it between his knobbleknuckled fingers flexing it slightly .Walnut and dragon heartstring he said .Twelve andthreequarter inches .Unyielding .This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange .And this one ?Ollivander performed the same examination .Hawthorn and unicorn hair .Ten inches precisely .Reasonably springy .This was the wand of Draco Malfoy .Was ?repeated Harry .Isnt it still his ?Perhaps not .If you took it I did then it may be yours .Of course the manner of taking matters .Much also depends upon the wand itself .In general however where a wand has been won its allegiance will change .There was silence in the room except for the distant rushing of the sea .You talk about wands like theyve got feelings said Harry like they can think for themselves .The wand chooses the wizard said Ollivander .That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore .A person can still use a wand that hasnt chosen them though ?asked Harry .Oh yes if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument .The best results however must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand .These connections are complex .An initial attraction and then a mutual quest for experience the wand learning from the wizard the wizard from the wand .The sea gushed forward and backward it was a mournful sound .I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force said Harry .Can I use it safely ?I think so .Subtle laws govern wand ownership but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master .So I should use this one ?said Ron pulling Wormtails wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander .Chestnut and dragon heartstring .Nineanda quarter inches .Brittle .I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping for Peter Pettigrew .Yes if you won it it is more likely to do your bidding and do it well than another wand .And this holds true for all wands does it ?asked Harry .I think so replied Ollivander his protuberant eyes upon Harrys face .You ask deep questions Mr Potter .Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic .So it isnt necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand ?asked Harry .Ollivander swallowed .Necessary ?No I should not say that it is necessary to kill .There are legends though said Harry and as his heart rate quickened the pain in his scar became more intense he was sure that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action .Legends about a wand or wands that have passed from hand to hand by murder .Ollivander turned pale .Against the snowy pillow he was light gray and his eyes were enormous bloodshot and bulging with what looked like fear .Only one wand I think he whispered .And YouKnowWho is interested in it isnt he ?asked Harry .I how ?croaked Ollivander and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help .How do you know this ?He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands said Harry .Ollivander looked terrified .He tortured me you must understand that !The Cruciatus Curse I I had no choice but to tell him what I knew what I guessed !I understand said Harry .You told him about the twin cores ?You said he just had to borrow another wizards wand ?Ollivander looked horrified transfixed by the amount that Harry knew .He nodded slowly .But it didnt work Harry went on .Mine still beat the borrowed wand .Do you know why that is ?Ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded .I had .never heard of such a thing .Your wand performed something unique that night .The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare yet why your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand I do not know .We were talking about the other wand the wand that changes hands by murder .When YouKnowWho realized my wand had done something strange he came back and asked about that other wand didnt he ?How do you know this ?Harry did not answer .Yes he asked whispered Ollivander .He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick the Wand of Destiny or the Elder Wand .Harry glanced sideways at Hermione .She looked flabbergasted .The Dark Lord said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones had always been happy with the wand I made him yew and phoenix feather thirteenandahalf inches until he discovered the connection of the twin cores .Now he seeks another more powerful wand as the only way to conquer yours .But hell know soon if he doesnt already that mines broken beyond repair said Harry quietly .No !said Hermione sounding frightened .He cant know that Harry how could he ?Priori Incantatem said Harry .We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys Hermione .If they examine them properly make them recreate the spells theyve cast lately theyll see that yours broke mine theyll see that you tried and failed to mend it and theyll realize that Ive been using the blackthorn one ever since .The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face .Ron gave Harry a reproachful look and said Lets not worry about that now But Mr Ollivander intervened .The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction Mr Potter .He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable .And will it ?The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack said Ollivander but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is I must admit .formidable .Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure when they first met of how much he liked Ollivander .Even now having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him .You you really think this wand exists then Mr Ollivander ?asked Hermione .Oh yes said Ollivander .Yes it is perfectly possible to trace the wands course through history .There are gaps of course and long ones where it vanishes from view temporarily lost or hidden but always it resurfaces .It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize .There are written accounts some of them obscure that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study .They have the ring of authenticity .So you you dont think it can be a fairy tale or a myth ?Hermione asked hopefully .No said Ollivander .Whether it needs to pass by murder I do not know .Its history is bloody but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object and arouses such passions in wizards .Immensely powerful dangerous in the wrong hands and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands .Mr Ollivander said Harry you told YouKnowWho that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand didnt you ?Ollivander turned if possible even paler .He looked ghostly as he gulped .But how how do you ?Never mind how I know it said Harry closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw for mere seconds a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade still dark because it was so much farther north .You told YouKnowWho that Gregorovitch had the wand ?It was a rumor whispered Ollivander .A rumor years and years ago long before you were born !I believe Gregorovitch himself started it .You can see how good it would be for business that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand !Yes I can see that said Harry .He stood up .Mr Ollivander one last thing and then well let you get some rest .What do you know about the Deathly Hallows ?The the what ?asked the wandmaker looking utterly bewildered .The Deathly Hallows .Im afraid I dont know what youre talking about .Is this still something to do with wands ?Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting .He did not know about the Hallows .Thank you said Harry .Thank you very much .Well leave you to get some rest now .Ollivander looked stricken .He was torturing me !he gasped .The Cruciatus Curse .you have no idea .I do said Harry .I really do .Please get some rest .Thank you for telling me all of this .He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase .Harry caught a glimpse of Bill Fleur Luna and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen cups of tea in front of them .They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden Ron and Hermione behind him .The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead and Harry walked back to it as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully .It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer .He would yield very soon because he needed to know that his theory was right .He must make only one more short effort so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione .Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago he said .I saw YouKnowWho trying to find him .When he tracked him down he found that Gregorovitch didnt have it anymore It was stolen from him by Grindelwald .How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it I dont know but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor it cant have been that difficult .Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts Harry could see him standing there and see too the lamp bobbing in the predawn coming closer and closer .And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful .And at the height of his power when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him he dueled Grindelwald and beat him and he took the Elder Wand .Dumbledore had the Elder Wand ?said Ron .But then where is it now ?At Hogwarts said Harry fighting to remain with them in the clifftop garden .But then lets go !said Ron urgently .Harry lets go and get it before he does !Its too late for that said Harry .He could not help himself but clutched his head trying to help it resist .He knows where it is .Hes there now .Harry !Ron said furiously .How long have you known this why have we been wasting time ?Why did you talk to Griphook first ?We could have gone we could still go No said Harry and he sank to his knees in the grass .Hermiones right .Dumbledore didnt want me to have it .He didnt want me to take it .He wanted me to get the Horcruxes .The unbeatable wand Harry !moaned Ron .Im not supposed to .Im supposed to get the Horcruxes .And now everything was cool and dark The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape up through the grounds toward the lake .I shall join you in the castle shortly he said in his high cold voice .Leave me now .Snape bowed and set off back up the path his black cloak billowing behind him .Harry walked slowly waiting for Snape s figure to disappear .It would not do for Snape or indeed anyone else to see where he was going .But there were no lights in the castle windows and he could conceal himself .and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes .And he walked on around the edge of the lake taking in the outlines of the beloved castle his first kingdom his birthright .And here it was beside the lake reflected in the dark waters .The white marble tomb an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape .He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria that heady sense of purpose in destruction .He raised the old yew wand How fitting that this would be its last great act .The tomb split open from head to foot .The shrouded figure was as long and thin as it had been in life .He raised the wand again .The wrappings fell open .The face was translucent pale sunken yet almost perfectly preserved .They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose He felt amused derision .Dumbledores hands were folded upon his chest and there it lay clutched beneath them buried with him .Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand ?Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb ?The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledores grasp and as he took it a shower of sparks flew from its tip sparkling over the corpse of its last owner ready to serve a new master at last .SHELL COTTAGE Bill and Fleurs cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed .It was a lonely and beautiful place .Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea like the breathing of some great slumbering creature .He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage craving the clifftop view of open sky and wide empty sea and the feel of cold salty wind on his face .The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry .He could not remember ever before choosing not to act .He was full of doubts doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together .What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand ?What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘worthy to get the Hallows ?Harry if that really is the Elder Wand how the hell are we supposed to finish off YouKnow Who ?Harry had no answers There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb .He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision they sounded feebler to him .The odd thing was that Hermiones support made him feel just as confused as Rons doubts .Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real she maintained that it was an evil object and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent not to be considered .You could never have done that Harry she said again and again .You couldnt have broken into Dumbledores grave .But the idea of Dumbledores corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledores intentions .He felt that he was still groping in the dark he had chosen his path but kept looking back wondering whether he had misread the signs whether he should not have taken the other way .From time to time anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died .But is he dead ?said Ron three days after they had arrived at the cottage .Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him he wished they had not having no wish to join in with their argument .Yes he is Ron please dont start that again !Look at the facts Hermione said Ron speaking across Harry who continued to gaze at the horizon .The silver doe .The sword .The eye Harry saw in the mirror Harry admits he could have imagined the eye !Dont you Harry ?I could have said Harry without looking at her .But you dont think you did do you ?asked Ron .No I dont said Harry .There you go !said Ron quickly before Hermione could carry on .If it wasnt Dumbledore explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar Hermione ?I cant but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if hes lying in a tomb at Hogwarts ?I dunno it couldve been his ghost !Dumbledore wouldnt come back as a ghost said Harry .There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now but he knew that much .He would have gone on .What dyou mean ‘gone on ?asked Ron but before Harry could say any more a voice behind them said Arry ?Fleur had come out of the cottage her long silver hair flying in the breeze .Arry Gripook would like to speak to you .E eez in ze smallest bedroom e says e does not want to be overeard .Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear she looked irritable as she walked back around the house .Griphook was waiting for them as Fleur had said in the tiniest of the cottages three bedrooms in which Hermione and Luna slept by night .He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright cloudy sky which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy light cottage .I have reached my decision Harry Potter said the goblin who was sitting crosslegged in a low chair drumming its arms with his spindly fingers .Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery I have decided to help you Thats great !said Harry relief surging through him .Griphook thank you were really in return said the goblin firmly for payment .Slightly taken aback Harry hesitated .How much do you want ?Ive got gold .Not gold said Griphook .I have gold .His black eyes glittered there were no whites to his eyes .I want the sword .The sword of Godric Gryffindor .Harrys spirits plummeted .You cant have that he said .Im sorry .Then said the goblin softly we have a problem .We can give you something else said Ron eagerly .Ill bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff you can take your pick once we get into the vault .He had said the wrong thing .Griphook flushed angrily .I am not a thief boy !I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right !The swords ours It is not said the goblin .Were Gryffindors and it was Godric Gryffindors And before it was Gryffindors whose was it ?demanded the goblin sitting up straight .No ones said Ron .It was made for him wasnt it ?No !cried the goblin bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron .Wizarding arrogance again !That sword was Ragnuk the Firsts taken from him by Godric Gryffindor !It is a lost treasure a masterpiece of goblinwork !It belongs with the goblins !The sword is the price of my hire take it or leave it !Griphook glared at them .Harry glanced at the other two then said We need to discuss this Griphook if thats all right .Could you give us a few minutes ?The goblin nodded looking sour .Downstairs in the empty sitting room Harry walked to the fireplace brow furrowed trying to think what to do .Behind him Ron said Hes having a laugh .We cant let him have that sword .It is true ?Harry asked Hermione .Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor ?I dont know she said hopelessly .Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races but theres no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword .Itll be one of those goblin stories said Ron about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them .I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasnt asked for one of our wands .Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards Ron said Hermione .Theyve been treated brutally in the past .Goblins arent exactly fluffy little bunnies though are they ?said Ron .Theyve killed plenty of us .Theyve fought dirty too .But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isnt going to make him more likely to help us is it ?There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem .Harry looked out of the window at Dobbys grave .Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone .Okay said Ron and Harry turned back to face him hows this ?We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it .Theres a fake in there isnt there ?We switch them and give him the fake .Ron hed know the difference better than we would !said Hermione .Hes the only one who realized there had been a swap !Yeah but we could scarper before he realizes He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him .That she said quietly is despicable .Ask for his help then doublecross him ?And you wonder why goblins dont like wizards Ron ?Rons ears had turned red .All right all right !It was the only thing I could think of !Whats your solution then ?We need to offer him something else something just as valuable .Brilliant .Ill go and get one of our other ancient goblinmade swords and you can gift wrap it .Silence fell between them again .Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword even if they had something as valuable to offer him .Yet the sword was their one indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes .He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea .The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggleborns the wizard who had clashed with the purebloodloving Slytherin .Maybe hes lying Harry said opening his eyes again .Griphook .Maybe Gryffindor didnt take the sword .How do we know the goblin version of historys right ?Does it make a difference ?asked Hermione .Changes how I feel about it said Harry .He took a deep breath .Well tell him he can have the sword after hes helped us get into that vault but well be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it .A grin spread slowly across Rons face .Hermione however looked alarmed .Harry we cant He can have it Harry went on after weve used it on all of the Horcruxes .Ill make sure he gets it then .Ill keep my word .But that could be years !said Hermione .I know that but he neednt .I wont be lying .really .Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame .He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard FOR THE GREATER GOOD .He pushed the idea away .What choice did they have ?I dont like it said Hermione .Nor do I much Harry admitted .Well I think its genius said Ron standing up again .Lets go and tell him .Back in the smallest bedroom Harry made the offer careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword .Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking he felt irritated at her afraid that she might give the game away .However Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry .I have your word Harry Potter that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you ?Yes said Harry .Then shake said the goblin holding out his hand .Harry took it and shook .He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own .Then Griphook relinquished him clapped his hands together and said So .We begin !It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again .They settled to work in the smallest bedroom which was kept according to Griphooks preference in semidarkness .I have visited the Lestranges vault only once Griphook told them on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword .It is one of the most ancient chambers .The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level where the vaults are largest and best protected .They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time .Slowly the days stretched into weeks .There was problem after problem to overcome not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted .Theres really only enough left for one of us said Hermione tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight .Thatll be enough said Harry who was examining Griphooks handdrawn map of the deepest passageways .The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes .Nobody asked questions although Harry often felt Bills eyes on the three of them at the table thoughtful concerned .The longer they spent together the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin .Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges vault .Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two but they did not discuss it They needed Griphook .The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them .Even after his legs had mended he continued to request trays of food in his room like the stillfrail Ollivander until Bill following an angry outburst from Fleur went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue .Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table although he refused to eat the same food insisting instead on lumps of raw meat roots and various fungi .Harry felt responsible It was after all he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding that Bill Fred George and Mr Weasley could no longer work .Im sorry he told Fleur one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner .I never meant you to have to deal with all of this .She had just set some knives to work chopping up steaks for Griphook and Bill who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback .While the knives sliced away behind her her somewhat irritable expression softened .Arry you saved my sisters life I do not forget .This was not strictly speaking true but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger .Anyway Fleur went on pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove which began to bubble at once Mr Ollivander leaves for Muriels zis evening .Zat will make zings easier .Ze goblin she scowled a little at the mention of him can move downstairs and you Ron and Dean can take zat room .We dont mind sleeping in the living room said Harry who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans .Dont worry about us .And when she tried to protest he went on Well be off your hands soon too Ron Hermione and I .We wont need to be here much longer .But what do you mean ?she said frowning at him her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair .Of course you must not leave you are safe ere !She looked rather like Mrs Weasley as she said it and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment .Luna and Dean entered their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood . .and tiny little ears Luna was saying a bit like a hippos Daddy says only purple and hairy .And if you want to call them you have to hum they prefer a waltz nothing too fast .Looking uncomfortable Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table .Seizing the chance to escape Fleurs questions Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them . .and if you ever come to our house Ill be able to show you the horn Daddy wrote to me about it but I havent seen it yet because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas Luna was saying as she and Dean relaid the fire .Luna we told you Hermione called over to her .That horn exploded .It came from an Erumpent not a CrumpleHorned Snorkack No it was definitely a Snorkack horn said Luna serenely .Daddy told me .It will probably have re formed by now they mend themselves you know .Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared leading Mr Ollivander down the stairs .The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail and he clung to Bills arm as the latter supported him carrying a large suitcase . ‘Tm going to miss you Mr Ollivander said Luna approaching the old man .And I you my dear said Ollivander patting her on the shoulder .You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place .So au revoir Mr Ollivander said Fleur kissing him on both cheeks .And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bills Auntie Muriel ?I never returned er tiara .It will be an honor said Ollivander with a little bow the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality .Fleur drew out a worn velvet case which she opened to show the wandmaker .The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the lowhanging lamp .Moonstones and diamonds said Griphook who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing .Made by goblins I think ?And paid for by wizards said Bill quietly and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging .A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night .The rest of them squeezed in around the table elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move they started to eat .The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them .Fleur Harry noticed was merely playing with her food she glanced at the window every few minutes however Bill returned before they had finished their first course his long hair tangled by the wind .Everythings fine he told Fleur .Ollivander settled in Mum and Dad say hello .Ginny sends you all her love .Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall theyre still operating an OwlOrder business out of her back room .It cheered her up to have her tiara back though .She said she thought wed stolen it .Ah she eez charmante your aunt said Fleur crossly waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair .She caught them and marched out of the room .Daddys made a tiara piped up Luna .Well more of a crown really .Ron caught Harrys eye and grinned Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius .Yes hes trying to recreate the lost diadem of Ravenclaw .He thinks hes identified most of the main elements now .Adding the billywig wings really made a difference There was a bang on the front door .Everyones head turned toward it .Fleur came running out of the kitchen looking frightened Bill jumped to his feet his wand pointing at the door Harry Ron and Hermione did the same .Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table out of sight .Who is it ?Bill called .It is I Remus John Lupin !called a voice over the howling wind .Harry experienced a thrill of fear what had happened ?I am a werewolf married to Nymphadora Tonks and you the SecretKeeper of Shell Cottage told me the address and bade me come in an emergency !Lupin muttered Bill and he ran to the door and wrenched it open .Lupin fell over the threshold .He was whitefaced wrapped in a traveling cloak his graying hair windswept .He straightened up looked around the room making sure of who was there then cried aloud Its a boy !Weve named him Ted after Doras father !Hermione shrieked .Wha ?Tonks Tonks has had the baby ?Yes yes shes had the baby !shouted Lupin .All around the table came cries of delight sighs of relief Hermione and Fleur both squealed Congratulations !and Ron said Blimey a baby !as if he had never heard of such a thing before .Yes yes a boy said Lupin again who seemed dazed by his own happiness .He strode around the table and hugged Harry the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened .Youll be godfather ?he said as he released Harry .Mme ?stammered Harry You yes of course Dora quite agrees no one better I yeah blimey Harry felt overwhelmed astonished delighted now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink .I cant stay long I must get back said Lupin beaming around at them all He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him .Thank you thank you Bill .Bill had soon filled all of their goblets they stood and raised them high in a toast .To Teddy Remus Lupin said Lupin a great wizard in the making !Oo does e look like ?Fleur inquired .I think he looks like Dora but she thinks he is like me .Not much hair .It looked black when he was born but I swear its turned ginger in the hour since .Probably be blond by the time I get back .Andromeda says Tonkss hair started changing color the day that she was born .He drained his goblet .Oh go on then just one more he added beaming as Bill made to fill it again .The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine .Lupins news seemed to have taken them out of themselves removed them for a while from their state of siege Tidings of new life were exhilarating .Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone .Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this until he saw Bills eyes following the goblin up the stairs .No .no .I really must get back said Lupin at last declining yet another goblet of wine .He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself .Goodbye goodbye Ill try and bring some pictures in a few days time theyll all be so glad to know that Ive seen you He fastened his cloak and made his farewells hugging the women and grasping hands with the men then still beaming returned into the wild night .Godfather Harry !said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together helping clear the table .A real honor !Congratulations !As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying Bill pulled the door behind him closed shutting out the stillvoluble voices of the others who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupins absence .I wanted a private word actually Harry .It hasnt been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people .Bill hesitated .Harry youre planning something with Griphook .It was a statement not a question and Harry did not bother to deny it .He merely looked at Bill waiting .I know goblins said Bill .Ive worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts .As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins I have goblin friends or at least goblins I know well and like .Again Bill hesitated .Harry what do you want from Griphook and what have you promised him in return ?I cant tell you that said Harry .Sorry Bill .The kitchen door opened behind them Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets .Wait Bill told her .Just a moment .She backed out and he closed the door again .Then I have to say this Bill went on .If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure you must be exceptionally careful .Goblin notions of ownership payment and repayment are not the same as human ones .Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort as though a small snake had stirred inside him .What do you mean ?he asked .We are talking about a different breed of being said Bill .Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries but youll know all that from History of Magic .There has been fault on both sides I would never claim that wizards have been innocent .However there is a belief among some goblins and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure that they have no respect for goblin ownership .I respect Harry began but Bill shook his head .You dont understand Harry nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins .To a goblin the rightful and true master of any object is the maker not the purchaser .All goblinmade objects are in goblin eyes rightfully theirs .But if it was bought then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money .They have however great difficulty with the idea of goblinmade objects passing from wizard to wizard .You saw Griphooks face when the tiara passed under his eyes .He disapproves .I believe he thinks as do the fiercest of his kind that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died .They consider our habit of keeping goblinmade objects passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment little more than theft .Harry had an ominous feeling now he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on .All I am saying said Bill setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room is to be very careful what you promise goblins Harry .It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin .Right said Harry as Bill opened the door yeah .Thanks .Ill bear that in mind .As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him born no doubt of the wine he had drunk .He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him .GRINGOTTS Their plans were made their preparations complete in the smallest bedroom a single long coarse black hair plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece .And youll be using her actual wand said Harry nodding toward the walnut wand so I reckon youll be pretty convincing .Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her as she picked it up .I hate this thing she said in a low voice .I really hate it .It feels all wrong it doesnt work properly for me .Its like a bit of her .Harry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own telling him to simply practice .He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her however the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her .Itll probably help you get in character though said Ron .Think what that wands done !But thats my point !said Hermione .This is the wand that tortured Nevilles mum and dad and who knows how many other people ?This is the wand that killed Sirius !Harry had not thought of that He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it to slice it in half with Gryffindors sword which was propped against the wall beside him .I miss my wand Hermione said miserably .I wish Mr Ollivander could have made me another one too .Mr Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning .She was out on the back lawn at that moment testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun .Dean who had lost his wand to the Snatchers was watching rather gloomily .Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy .He had been surprised but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione s had done .Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands Harry thought he knew what Hermione s problem was She had not won the walnut wands allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix .The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered .Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him but regretted his action at once He could tell that the goblin had noticed .Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment he said Weve just been checking the lastminute stuff Griphook .Weve told Bill and Fleur were leaving tomorrow and weve told them not to get up to see us off .They had been firm on this point because Hermione would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do the better .They had also explained that they would not be returning .As they had lost Perkinss old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them Bill had lent them another one .It was now packed inside the beaded bag which Harry was impressed to learn Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock .Though he would miss Bill Fleur Luna and Dean not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage .He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard tired of being shut in the tiny dark bedroom .Most of all he longed to be rid of Griphook .However precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindors sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer .It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it because the goblin rarely left Harry Ron and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time He could give my mother lessons growled Ron as the goblins long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors .With Bills warning in mind Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery .Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned doublecross that Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it Ron on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphookfree moments had come up with nothing better than Well just have to wing it mate .Harry slept badly that night .Lying awake in the early hours he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination almost an excitement .Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety nagging doubts He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong .He kept telling himself that their plan was good that Griphook knew what they were facing that they were wellprepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter yet still he felt uneasy .Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was awake but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean so Harry did not speak .It was a relief when six oclock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags dress in the semidarkness then creep out into the garden where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook .The dawn was chilly but there was little wind now that it was May .Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff He was going to miss the sound .Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobbys grave now in a years time the mound would be covered in flowers .The white stone that bore the elfs name had already acquired a weathered look .He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind .Looking down on the grave he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them .His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck through which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledores eye .Then the sound of a door opening made him look around .Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them accompanied by Griphook .As she walked she was tucking the small beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place .Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione he could not suppress a shiver of loathing .She was taller than he was her long black hair rippling down her back her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him but then she spoke and he heard Hermione through Bellatrixs low voice .She tasted disgusting worse than Gurdyroots !Okay Ron come here so I can do you .Right but remember I dont like the beard too long Oh for heavens sake this isnt about looking handsome Its not that it gets in the way !But I liked my nose a bit shorter try and do it the way you did last time .Hermione sighed and set to work muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Rons appearance .He was to be given a completely fake identity and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him .Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak .There said Hermione how does he look Harry ?It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise but only Harry thought because he knew him so well .Rons hair was now long and wavy he had a thick brown beard and mustache no freckles a short broad nose and heavy eyebrows .Well hes not my type but hell do said Harry .Shall we go then ?All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage lying dark and silent under the fading stars then turned and began to walk toward the point just beyond the boundary wall where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate .Once past the gate Griphook spoke .I should climb up now Harry Potter I think ?Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back his hands linked in front of Harrys throat .He was not heavy but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on .Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both .Perfect she said bending down to check Harrys feet .I cant see a thing .Lets go .Harry turned on the spot with Griphook on his shoulders concentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley .The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness and seconds later Harrys feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road .Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning quite unconscious of the little inns existence .The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted .Tom the stooped and toothless landlord was polishing glasses behind the bar counter a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows .Madam Lestrange murmured Tom and as Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently .Good morning said Hermione and as Harry crept past still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak he saw Tom look surprised .Too polite Harry whispered in Hermiones ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard .You need to treat people like theyre scum !Okay okay !Hermione drew out Bellatrixs wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them .At once the bricks began to whirl and spin A hole appeared in the middle of them which grew wider and wider finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley .It was quiet barely time for the shops to open and there were hardly any shoppers abroad .The crooked cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before .More shops than ever were boarded up though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit .Harrys own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE .A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways .He heard them moaning to the few passersby pleading for gold insisting that they were really wizards .One man had a bloody bandage over his eye .As they set off along the street the beggars glimpsed Hermione .They seemed to melt away before her drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could .Hermione looked after them curiously until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path .My children !he bellowed pointing at her .His voice was cracked highpitched he sounded distraught .Where are my children ?What has he done with them ?You know you know I I really stammered Hermione .The man lunged at her reaching for her throat Then with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground unconscious .Ron stood there his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard .Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street while a little knot of prosperouslooking passersby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots keen to vacate the scene .Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan .Before they could move or consult one another however they heard a cry from behind them .Why Madam Lestrange !Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harrys neck A tall thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long sharp nose was striding toward them .Its Travers hissed the goblin into Harrys ear but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was .Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster And what do you want ?Travers stopped in his tracks clearly affronted .Hes another Death Eater breathed Griphook and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione s ear .I merely sought to greet you said Travers coolly but if my presence is not welcome .Harry recognized his voice now Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophiliuss house .No no not at all Travers said Hermione quickly trying to cover up her mistake .How are you ?Well I confess I am surprised to see you out and about Bellatrix .Really ?Why ?asked Hermione .Well Travers coughed I heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house after the .ah .escape .Harry willed Hermione to keep her head .If this was true and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrixs most contemptuous manner .Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is Travers .Though the Death Eater looked offended he also seemed less suspicious .He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned .How did it offend you ?It does not matter it will not do so again said Hermione coolly .Some of these wandless can be troublesome said Travers .While they do nothing but beg I have no objection but one of them actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week . ‘Im a witch sir Im a witch let me prove it to youV he said in a squeaky impersonation .As if I was going to give her my wand but whose wand said Travers curiously are you using at the moment Bellatrix ?I heard that your own was I have my wand here said Hermione coldly holding up Bellatrixs wand .I dont know what rumors you have been listening to Travers but you seem sadly misinformed .Travers seemed a little taken aback at that and he turned instead to Ron .Who is your friend ?I do not recognize him .This is Dragomir Despard said Hermione they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume .He speaks very little English but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lords aims .He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime .Indeed ?How do you do Dragomir ?Ow you ?said Ron holding out his hand .Travers extended two fingers and shook Rons hand as though frightened of dirtying himself .So what brings you and your ah sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early ?asked Travers .I need to visit Gringotts said Hermione .Alas I also said Travers .Gold filthy gold !We cannot live without it yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our longfingered friends .Harry felt Griphooks clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck .Shall we ?said Travers gesturing Hermione forward .Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked cobbled street toward the place where the snowywhite Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops .Ron sloped along beside them and Harry and Griphook followed .A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed and the worst of it was with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrixs side there was no means for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron .All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors .As Griphook had already warned them the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods .Ah Probity Probes sighed Travers theatrically so crude but effective !And he set off up the steps nodding left and right to the wizards who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body .The Probes Harry knew detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects .Knowing that he had only seconds Harry pointed Dracos wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured Confundo twice .Unnoticed by Travers who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them .Hermione s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps .One moment madam said the guard raising his Probe .But youve just done that !said Hermione in Bellatrixs commanding arrogant voice .Travers looked around eyebrows raised .The guard was confused .He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion who said in a slightly dazed voice Yeah youve just checked them Marius .Hermione swept forward Ron by her side Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them .Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold The wizards were both scratching their heads .Two goblins stood before the inner doors which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves .Harry looked up at it and all of a sudden a knifesharp memory came to him standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven the most wonderful birthday of his life and Hagrid standing beside him saying Like I said yehd be mad ter try an rob it .Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal .But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank .The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of the day .Hermione Ron and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass .Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron .The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside said to nobody in particular Leprechaun and then greeted Travers who passed over a tiny golden key which was examined and given back to him .Hermione stepped forward .Madam Lestrange !said the goblin evidently startled .Dear me !How how may I help you today ?I wish to enter my vault said Hermione .The old goblin seemed to recoil a little .Harry glanced around .Not only was Travers hanging back watching but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione .You have .identification ?asked the goblin .Identification ?I I have never been asked for identification before !said Hermione .They know whispered Griphook in Harrys ear .They must have been warned there might be an impostor !Your wand will do madam said the goblin .He held out a slightly trembling hand and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrixs wand had been stolen .Act now act now whispered Griphook in Harrys ear the Imperius Cursel Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak pointed it at the old goblin and whispered for the first time in his life Imperiol A curious sensation shot down Harrys arm a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast .The goblin took Bellatrixs wand examined it closely and then said Ah you have had a new wand made Madam Lestrange !What ?said Hermione .No no thats mine A new wand ?said Travers approaching the counter again still the goblins all around were watching .But how could you have done which wandmaker did you use ?Harry acted without thinking Pointing his wand at Travers he muttered Imperiol once more .Oh yes I see said Travers looking down at Bellatrixs wand yes very handsome .And is it working well ?I always think wands require a little breaking in dont you ?Hermione looked utterly bewildered but to Harrys enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment .The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached .I shall need the Clankers he told the goblin who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal which he handed to his senior .Good good !So if you will follow me Madam Lestrange said the old goblin hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight I shall take you to your vault .He appeared around the end of the counter jogging happily toward them the contents of the leather bag still jingling .Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open .Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion .Wait Bogrod !Another goblin came scurrying around the counter .We have instructions he said with a bow to Hermione .Forgive me Madam but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange .He whispered urgently in Bogrods ear but the Imperiused goblin shook him off .I am aware of the instructions .Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault .Very old family .old clients .This way please .And still clanking he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall .Harry looked back at Travers who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant and made his decision With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond which was lit with flaming torches .Were in trouble they suspect said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak .Griphook jumped down from his shoulders neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst .Theyre Imperiused he added in response to Hermione and Rons confused queries about Travers and Bogrod who were both now standing there looking blank .I dont think I did it strongly enough I dont know .And another memory darted through his mind of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse You need to mean them Potter !What do we do ?asked Ron .Shall we get out now while we can ?If we can said Hermione looking back toward the door into the main hall beyond which who knew what was happening .Weve got this far I say we go on said Harry .Good !said Griphook .So we need Bogrod to control the cart I no longer have the authority .But there will not be room for the wizard .Harry pointed his wand at Travers .Imperio The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace .What are you making him do ?Hide said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness .Harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it Bogrod in front with Griphook Harry Ron and Hermione crammed together in the back .With a jerk the cart moved off gathering speed They hurtled past Travers who was wriggling into a crack in the wall then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages sloping downward all the time .Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites flying ever deeper into the earth but he kept glancing back .They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them the more he thought about it the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix to have brought along Bellatrixs wand when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them with seconds to spare a waterfall pounding over the track .Harry heard Griphook shout No !but there was no braking They zoomed through it .Water filled Harrys eyes and mouth He could not see or breathe Then with an awful lurch the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it .Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall heard Hermione shriek something and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor .CCushioning Charm Hermione spluttered as Ron pulled her to her feet but to Harrys horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix instead she stood there in overlarge robes sopping wet and completely herself Ron was redhaired and beardless again .They were realizing it as they looked at each other feeling their own faces .The Thiefs Downfall !said Griphook clambering to his feet and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks which Harry knew now had been more than water .It washes away all enchantment all magical concealment !They know there are impostors in Gringotts they have set off defenses against us !Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak .Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment The Thiefs Downfall seemed to have lifted the Imperius Curse .We need him said Griphook we cannot enter the vault without a Gringotts goblin .And we need the Clankers !Imperiol Harry said again his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand .Bogrod submitted once more to his will his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools .Harry I think I can hear people coming !said Hermione and she pointed Bellatrixs wand at the waterfall and cried Protego They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway .Good thinking said Harry .Lead the way Griphook !How are we going to get out again ?Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog .Lets worry about that when we have to said Harry .He was trying to listen He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby .Griphook how much farther ?Not far Harry Potter not far .And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared but which still brought all of them to a halt .A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place .The beasts scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground its eyes were milkily pink both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor .Its great spiked wings folded close to its body would have filled the chamber if it spread them and when it turned its ugly head toward them it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble opened its mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway .It is partially blind panted Griphook but even more savage for that .However we have the means to control it .It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come .Give them to me .Ron passed the bag to Griphook and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils .Griphook handed them out Bogrod accepted his meekly .You know what to do Griphook told Harry Ron and Hermione .It will expect pain when it hears the noise It will retreat and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault .They advanced around the corner again shaking the Clankers and the noise echoed off the rocky walls grossly magnified so that the inside of Harrys skull seemed to vibrate with the din .The dragon let out another hoarse roar then retreated .Harry could see it trembling and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers .Make him press his hand to the door !Griphook urged Harry who turned his wand again upon Bogrod .The old goblin obeyed pressing his palm to the wood and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets silver armor the skins of strange creatures some with long spines others with drooping wings potions in jeweled flasks and a skull still wearing a crown .Search fast !said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault .He had described Hufflepuffs cup to Ron and Hermione but if it was the other unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault he did not know what it looked like .He barely had time to glance around however before there was a muffled clunk from behind them The door had reappeared sealing them inside the vault and they were plunged into total darkness .No matter Bogrod will be able to release us !said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise .Light your wands cant you ?And hurry we have very little time !Lumosl Harry shone his lit wand around the vault Its beam fell upon glittering jewels he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains .Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them .Harry could this be ?Aargh !Hermione screamed in pain and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip .But as it fell it split became a shower of goblets so that a second later with a great clatter the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction the original impossible to discern amongst them .It burned me !moaned Hermione sucking her blistered fingers .They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses !said Griphook .Everything you touch will burn and multiply but the copies are worthless and if you continue to handle the treasure you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold !Okay dont touch anything !said Harry desperately but even as he said it Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal .Stand still dont move !said Hermione clutching at Ron .Just look around !said Harry .Remember the cups small and gold its got a badger engraved on it two handles otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaws symbol anywhere the eagle They directed their wands into every nook and crevice turning cautiously on the spot .It was impossible not to brush up against anything Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets and now there was scarcely room to place their feet and the glowing gold blazed with heat so that the vault felt like a furnace .Harrys wandlight passed over shields and goblin made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling higher and higher he raised the beam until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble .Its there its up there Ron and Hermione pointed their wands at it too so that the little golden cup sparkled in a threeway spotlight the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle .And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything ?asked Ron .Accio Cup cried Hermione who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions .No use no use !snarled the goblin .Then what do we do ?said Harry glaring at the goblin .If you want the sword Griphook then youll have to help us more than wait !Can I touch stuff with the sword ?Hermione give it here !Hermione fumbled inside her robes drew out the beaded bag rummaged for a few seconds then removed the shining sword .Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby which did not multiply .If I can just poke the sword through a handle but how am I going to get up there ?The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them even Ron who was tallest .The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves and sweat ran down Harrys face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder .They were truly trapped now There was no way out except through the door and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side .Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces .Hermione said Harry as the clanking grew louder Ive got to get up there weve got to get rid of it She raised her wand pointed it at Harry and whispered Levicorpus .Hoisted into the air by his ankle Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like whitehot bodies filling the cramped space .With screams of pain Ron Hermione and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects which also began to replicate .Half buried in a rising tide of redhot treasure they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuffs cup hooking it onto the blade .Impervius screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself Ron and the goblins from the burning metal .Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down Ron and Hermione were waistdeep in treasure struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view .Harry seized Griphooks fingers and pulled .The blistered goblin emerged by degrees howling .Liberacorpus yelled Harry and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure and the sword flew out of Harrys hand .Get it !Harry yelled fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again determined to avoid the swelling mass of redhot objects .Wheres the sword ?It had the cup on it !The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening it was too late There !It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word .One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harrys hair to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harrys reach .The tiny golden cup skewered by the handle on the swords blade was flung into the air .The goblin still astride him Harry dived and caught it and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him Ron and Hermione into the outer chamber .Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword but Griphook was gone .Sliding from Harrys shoulders the moment he could he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins brandishing the sword and crying Thieves !Thieves !Help !Thieves !He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question .Slipping on the hot metal Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through .Stupefyl he bellowed and Ron and Hermione joined in Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins and some toppled over but others advanced and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner .The tethered dragon let out a roar and a gush of flame flew over the goblins The wizards fled doubled up back the way they had come and inspiration or madness came to Harry .Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor he yelled Relashiol The cuffs broke open with loud bangs .This way !Harry yelled and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins he sprinted toward the blind dragon .Harry Harry what are you doing ?cried Hermione .Get up climb up come on The dragon had not realized that it was free Harrys foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back .The scales were hard as steel it did not even seem to feel him .He stretched out an arm Hermione hoisted herself up Ron climbed on behind them and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered .With a roar it reared Harry dug in his knees clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles and it soared into the air .Harry Ron and Hermione flat on its back scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks .Well never get out its too big !Hermione screamed but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again blasting the tunnel whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled .By sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through .Harrys eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust Deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragons roars he could only cling to its back expecting to be shaken off at any moment then he heard Hermione yelling Defodiol She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air away from the shrieking and clanking goblins Harry and Ron copied her blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells .They passed the underground lake and the great crawling snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it and behind them the passage was full of the dragons thrashing spiked tail of great lumps of rock gigantic fractured stalactites and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled while ahead the dragons fire kept their progress clear And then at last by the combined force of their spells and the dragons brute strength they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway .Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance it took off and with Harry Ron and Hermione still clinging to its back it forced its way through the metal doors leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky .THE FINAL HIDING PLACE There was no means of steering the dragon could not see where it was going and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back .Nevertheless as they climbed higher and higher London unfurling below them like a grayandgreen map Harrys overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible .Crouching low over the beasts neck he clung tight to the metallic scales and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin the dragons wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill .Behind him whether from delight or fear he could not tell Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice and Hermione seemed to be sobbing .After five minutes or so Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening .He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing nor how this particular dragon which could barely see would locate a good place to put down .He glanced around constantly imagining that he could feel his scar prickling .How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges vault ?How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix ?How quickly would they realize what had been taken ?And then when they discovered that the golden cup was missing ?Voldemort would know at last that they were hunting Horcruxes .The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air It climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital .On and on they flew over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon .What do you reckon its looking for ?Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north .No idea Harry bellowed back .His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip .He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them if the dragon headed for open sea he was cold and numb not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty .When he wondered had the beast itself last eaten ?Surely it would need sustenance before long ?And what if at that point it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back ?The sun slipped lower in the sky which was turning indigo and still the dragon flew cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud .Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragons back .Is it my imagination shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence or are we losing height ?Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes coppery in the sunset .The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight .Lower and lower the dragon flew in great spiraling circles honing in it seemed upon one of the smaller lakes .I say we jump when it gets low enough !Harry called back to the others .Straight into the water before it realizes were here !They agreed Hermione a little faintly and now Harry could see the dragons wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water .NOW !He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard plunging like a stone into a freezing green reedfilled world .He kicked toward the surface and emerged panting to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen .The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything It was already fifty feet away swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout .As Ron and Hermione emerged spluttering and gasping from the depths of the lake the dragon flew on its wings beating hard and landed at last on a distant bank .Harry Ron and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore .The lake did not seem to be deep Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming and at last they flopped sodden panting and exhausted onto slippery grass .Hermione collapsed coughing and shuddering .Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept he staggered to his feet drew out his wand and started casting the usual protective spells around them .When he had finished he joined the others .It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault .Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms and their clothing was singed away in places .They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries .Hermione handed Harry the bottle then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean dry robes for all of them .They changed and then gulped down the juice .Well on the upside said Ron finally who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow we got the Horcrux .On the downside no sword said Harry through gritted teeth as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath .No sword repeated Ron .That doublecrossing little scab .Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them .Glinting in the sun it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice .At least we cant wear it this time thatd look a bit weird hanging round our necks said Ron wiping his mouth on the back of his hand .Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking .Whatll happen to it do you think ?she asked .Will it be all right ?You sound like Hagrid said Ron .Its a dragon Hermione it can look after itself .Its us we need to worry about .What do you mean ?Well I dont know how to break this to you said Ron but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts .All three of them started to laugh and once started it was difficult to stop .Harrys ribs ached he felt lightheaded with hunger but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw .What are we going to do though ?said Hermione finally hiccuping herself back to seriousness .Hell know wont he ?You Know Who will know we know about his Horcruxes !Maybe theyll be too scared to tell him ?said Ron hopefully .Maybe theyll cover up The sky the smell of lake water the sound of Rons voice were extinguished Pain cleaved Harrys head like a sword stroke .He was standing in a dimly lit room and a semicircle of wizards faced him and on the floor at his feet knelt a small quaking figure .What did you say to me ?His voice was high and cold but fury and fear burned inside him .The one thing he had dreaded but it could not be true he could not see how .The goblin was trembling unable to meet the red eyes high above his .Say it again !murmured Voldemort .Say it again .Mmy Lord stammered the goblin its black eyes wide with terror mmy Lord .we ttried tto ststop them .Imimpostors my Lord .broke broke into the into the Lestranges vvault .Impostors ?What impostors ?I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors ?Who were they ?It was .it was .the PPotter bboy and ttwo accomplices .And they took ?he said his voice rising a terrible fear gripping him .Tell me !What did they take ?A .a ssmall golden ccup mmy Lord .The scream of rage of denial left him as if it were a strangers He was crazed frenzied it could not be true it was impossible nobody had ever known How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret ?The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room the kneeling goblin rolled over dead the watching wizards scattered before him terrified Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door and again and again his wand fell and those who were left were slain all of them for bringing him this news for hearing about the golden cup Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down and they passed before him in vision his treasures his safeguards his anchors to immortality the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen What if what if the boy knew about the others ?Could he know had he already acted had he traced more of them ?Was Dumbledore at the root of this ?Dumbledore who had always suspected him Dumbledore dead on his orders Dumbledore whose wand was his now yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy the boy But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes he Lord Voldemort would have known would have felt it ?He the greatest wizard of them all he the most powerful he the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless nameless men How could Lord Voldemort not have known if he himself most important and precious had been attacked mutilated ?True he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed but he had thought that was because he had no body to feel being less than ghost .No surely the rest were safe .The other Horcruxes must be intact .But he must know he must be sure .He paced the room kicking aside the goblins corpse as he passed and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain the lake the shack and Hogwarts A modicum of calm cooled his rage now How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack ?No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts he had hidden the connection the killings had never been traced to him The ring surely was safe .And how could the boy or anybody else know about the cave or penetrate its protection ?The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd .As for the school He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place .And there was still Nagini who must remain close now no longer sent to do his bidding under his protection .But to be sure to be utterly sure he must return to each of his hiding places he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes .A job like the quest for the Elder Wand that he must undertake alone .Which should he visit first which was in most danger ?An old unease flickered inside him .Dumbledore had known his middle name .Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts .Their abandoned home was perhaps the least secure of his hiding places it was there that he would go first .The lake surely impossible .though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds through the orphanage .And Hogwarts .but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection let alone the school .Nevertheless it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle .To tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish of course it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy Didnt their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust ?He would visit the Gaunt shack first then and take Nagini with him He would not be parted from the snake anymore .and he strode from the room through the hall and out into the dark garden where the fountain played he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow .Harrys eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him .Judging by their worried looks and by the continued pounding of his scar his sudden excursion into Voldemorts mind had not passed unnoticed .He struggled up shivering vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him and the lake deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun .He knows .His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemorts high screams .He knows and hes going to check where the others are and the last one he was already on his feet is at Hogwarts .I knew it .I knew it .What ?Ron was gaping at him Hermione sat up looking worried .But what did you see ?How do you know ?I saw him find out about the cup I I was in his head hes Harry remembered the killings hes seriously angry and scared too he cant understand how we knew and now hes going to check the others are safe the ring first .He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest because Snapes there because itll be so hard not to be seen getting in I think hell check that one last but he could still be there within hours Did you see where in Hogwarts it is ?asked Ron now scrambling to his feet too .No he was concentrating on warning Snape he didnt think about exactly where it is Wait wait cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again .We cant just go we havent got a plan we need to We need to get going said Harry firmly .He had been hoping to sleep looking forward to getting into the new tent but that was impossible now .Can you imagine what hes going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone ?What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux decides it isnt safe enough ?But how are we going to get in ?Well go to Hogsmeade said Harry and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the schools like .Get under the Cloak Hermione I want to stick together this time .But we dont really fit Itll be dark no ones going to notice our feet .The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air .They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher now black against the rapidly darkening sky until it vanished over a nearby mountain .Then Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two .Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness .THE MISSING MIRROR Harrys feet touched road .He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street dark shop fronts and the outline of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks and with a lurch of the heart he remembered with piercing accuracy how he had landed here nearly a year before supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore all this in a second upon landing and then even as he relaxed his grip upon Rons and Hermiones arms it happened .The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemorts when he had realized the cup had been stolen It tore at every nerve in Harrys body and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it .Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street their wands aloft .Harry seized Rons wrist as he raised his wand there were too many of them to Stun Even attempting it would give away their position .One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped still echoing around the distant mountains .Accio Cloak .roared one of the Death Eaters .Harry seized its folds but it made no attempt to escape The Summoning Charm had not worked on it .Not under your wrapper then Potter ?yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows Spread out .Hes here .Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them Harry Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street and the Death Eaters missed them by inches .They waited in the darkness listening to the footsteps running up and down beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters searching wands .Lets just leave !Hermione whispered .Disapparate now !Great idea said Ron but before Harry could reply a Death Eater shouted We know youre here Potter and theres no getting away !Well find you !They were ready for us whispered Harry .They set up that spell to tell them wed come .I reckon theyve done something to keep us here trap us What about dementors ?called another Death Eater .Let em have free rein theyd find him quick enough !The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his an dementors wont kill him !The Dark Lord wants Potters life not his soul .Hell be easier to kill if hes been Kissed first !There were noises of agreement .Dread filled Harry To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately .Were going to have to try to Disapparate Harry !Hermione whispered .Even as she said it he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street .Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars which vanished .In the pitchblackness he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together they turned on the spot .The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid They could not Disapparate the Death Eaters had cast their charms well .The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harrys flesh .He Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound .Then around the corner gliding noiselessly came dementors ten or more of them visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands .Could they sense fear in the vicinity ?Harry was sure of it They seemed to be coming more quickly now taking those dragging rattling breaths he detested tasting despair on the air closing in He raised his wand He could not would not suffer the Dementors Kiss whatever happened afterward .It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered Expecto Patronum .The silver stag burst from his wand and charged The dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight .Its him down there down there I saw his Patronus it was a stag !The dementors had retreated the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do there was a grinding of bolts nearby a door opened on the lefthand side of the narrow street and a rough voice said Potter in here quick !He obeyed without hesitation The three of them hurtled through the open doorway .Upstairs keep the Cloak on keep quiet !muttered a tall figure passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him .Harry had had no idea where they were but now he saw by the stuttering light of a single candle the grubby sawdust strewn bar of the Hogs Head Inn .They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could .The stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness .Shouts reached them from the street below .Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak they crept toward the grimy window and looked down .Their savior whom Harry now recognized as the Hogs Heads barman was the only person not wearing a hood .So what ?he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces .So what ?You send dementors down my street Ill send a Patronus back at em !Im not having em near me Ive told you that Im not having it !That wasnt your Patronus !said a Death Eater .That was a stag it was Potters !Stag !roared the barman and he pulled out a wand .Stag !You idiot Expecto Patronum .Something huge and horned erupted from the wand Head down it charged toward the High Street and out of sight .Thats not what I saw said the Death Eater though with less certainty .Curfews been broken you heard the noise one of his companions told the barman .Someone was out in the street against regulations If I want to put my cat out I will and be damned to your curfew !You set off the Caterwauling Charm ?What if I did ?Going to cart me off to Azkaban ?Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door ?Do it then if you want to !But I hope for your sakes you havent pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him .Hes not going to like being called here for me and my old cat is he now ?Dont you worry about us said one of the Death Eaters worry about yourself breaking curfew !And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pubs closed down ?Whatll happen to your little sidelines then ?Are you threatening ?I keep my mouth shut its why you come here isnt it ?I still say I saw a stag Patronus !shouted the first Death Eater .Stag ?roared the barman .Its a goat idiot !All right we made a mistake said the second Death Eater .Break curfew again and we wont be so lenient !The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street .Hermione moaned with relief wove out from under the Cloak and sat down on a wobblelegged chair .Harry drew the curtains tight shut then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron .They could hear the barman down below rebolting the door of the bar then climbing the stairs .Harrys attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece a small rectangular mirror propped on top of it right beneath the portrait of the girl .The barman entered the room .You bloody fools he said gruffly looking from one to the other of them .What were you thinking coming here ?Thank you said Harry .We cant thank you enough .You saved our lives .The barman grunted .Harry approached him looking up into the face trying to see past the long stringy wiregray hair and beard .He wore spectacles .Behind the dirty lenses the eyes were a piercing brilliant blue .Its your eye Ive been seeing in the mirror .There was silence in the room .Harry and the barman looked at each other .You sent Dobby .The barman nodded and looked around for the elf .Thought hed be with you .Where Ve you left him ?Hes dead said Harry .Bellatrix Lestrange killed him .The barmans face was impassive .After a few moments he said Im sorry to hear it .I liked that elf .He turned away lighting lamps with prods of his wand not looking at any of them .Youre Aberforth said Harry to the mans back .He neither confirmed nor denied it but bent to light the fire .How did you get this ?Harry asked walking across to Siriuss mirror the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before .Bought it from Dung bout a year ago said Aberforth .Albus told me what it was .Been trying to keep an eye out for you .Ron gasped .The silver doe !he said excitedly .Was that you too ?What are you talking about ?said Aberforth .Someone sent a doe Patronus to us !Brains like that you could be a Death Eater son .Havent I just proved my Patronus is a goat ?Oh said Ron .Yeah .well Im hungry !he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble .I got food said Aberforth and he sloped out of the room reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread some cheese and a pewter jug of mead which he set upon a small table in front of the fire .Ravenous they ate and drank and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing .Right then said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs .We need to think of the best way to get you out of here .Cant be done by night you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness Caterwauling Charms set off theyll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs .I dont reckon Ill be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time .Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot .Get right out of Hogsmeade up into the mountains and youll be able to Disapparate there .Might see Hagrid .Hes been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him .Were not leaving said Harry .We need to get into Hogwarts .Dont be stupid boy said Aberforth .Weve got to said Harry .What youve got to do said Aberforth leaning forward is to get as far from here as you can .You dont understand .There isnt much time .Weve got to get into the castle .Dumbledore I mean your brother wanted us The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth s glasses momentarily opaque a bright flat white and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider Aragog .My brother Albus wanted a lot of things said Aberforth and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans .You get away from this school Potter and out of the country if you can .Forget my brother and his clever schemes .Hes gone where none of this can hurt him and you dont owe him anything .You dont understand said Harry again .Oh dont I ?said Aberforth quietly .You dont think I understood my own brother ?Think you knew Albus better than I did ?I didnt mean that said Harry whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine .Its .he left me a job .Did he now ?said Aberforth .Nice job I hope ?Pleasant ?Easy ?Sort of thing youd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves ?Ron gave a rather grim laugh .Hermione was looking strained .Iits not easy no said Harry .But Ive got to ‘Got to ?Why ‘got to ?Hes dead isnt he ?said Aberforth roughly .Let it go boy before you follow him !Save yourself !I cant .Why not ?I Harry felt overwhelmed he could not explain so he took the offensive instead .But youre fighting too youre in the Order of the Phoenix I was said Aberforth .The Order of the Phoenix is finished .YouKnowWhos won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves .Itll never be safe for you here Potter he wants you too badly .So go abroad go into hiding save yourself .Best take these two with you .He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione .Theyll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows theyve been working with you .I cant leave said Harry .Ive got a job Give it to someone else !I cant .Its got to be me Dumbledore explained it all Oh did he now ?And did he tell you everything was he honest with you ?Harry wanted with all his heart to say Yes but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips .Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking .I knew my brother Potter .He learned secrecy at our mothers knee .Secrets and lies thats how we grew up and Albus .he was a natural .The old mans eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece .It was now Harry looked around properly the only picture in the room .There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore nor of anyone else .Mr Dumbledore ?said Hermione rather timidly .Is that your sister ?Ariana ?Yes said Aberforth tersely .Been reading Rita Skeeter have you missy ?Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red .Elphias Doge mentioned her to us said Harry trying to spare Hermione .That old berk muttered Aberforth taking another swig of mead .Thought the sun shone out of my brothers every orifice he did .Well so did plenty of people you three included by the looks of it .Harry kept quiet .He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now .He had made his choice while he dug Dobbys grave he had decided to continue along the winding dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know but simply to trust .He had no desire to doubt again he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose .He met Aberforth s gaze which was so strikingly like his brothers The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were Xraying the object of their scrutiny and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it .Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry very much said Hermione in a low voice .Did he now ?said Aberforth .Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if hed left em well alone .What do you mean ?asked Hermione breathlessly .Never you mind said Aberforth .But thats a really serious thing to say !said Hermione .Are you are you talking about your sister ?Aberforth glared at her His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back .Then he burst into speech .When my sister was six years old she was attacked set upon by three Muggle boys .Theyd seen her doing magic spying through the back garden hedge She was a kid she couldnt control it no witch or wizard can at that age .What they saw scared them I expect .They forced their way through the hedge and when she couldnt show them the trick they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it .Hermione s eyes were huge in the firelight Ron looked slightly sick .Aberforth stood up tall as Albus and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain .It destroyed her what they did She was never right again .She wouldnt use magic but she couldnt get rid of it it turned inward and drove her mad it exploded out of her when she couldnt control it and at times she was strange and dangerous .But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless .And my father went after the bastards that did it said Aberforth and attacked them .And they locked him up in Azkaban for it .He never said why hed done it because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become shed have been locked up in St .Mungos for good .Theyd have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy unbalanced like she was with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldnt keep it in any longer .We had to keep her safe and quiet .We moved house put it about she was ill and my mother looked after her and tried to keep her calm and happy .I was her favorite he said and as he said it a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforths wrinkles and tangled beard .Not Albus he was always up in his bedroom when he was home reading his books and counting his prizes keeping up with his correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day Aberforth sneered .He didnt want to be bothered with her .She liked me best .I could get her to eat when she wouldnt do it for my mother I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages and when she was quiet she used to help me feed the goats .Then when she was fourteen .See I wasnt there said Aberforth .If Id been there I could have calmed her down .She had one of her rages and my mother wasnt as young as she was and .it was an accident .Ariana couldnt control it .But my mother was killed .Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion he did not want to hear any more but Aberforth kept talking and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this whether in fact he had ever spoken about it .So that put paid to Albuss trip round the world with little Doge .The pair of em came home for my mothers funeral and then Doge went off on his own and Albus settled down as head of the family .Ha !Aberforth spat into the fire .Id have looked after her I told him so I didnt care about school Id have stayed home and done it .He told me I had to finish my education and hed take over from my mother .Bit of a comedown for Mr Brilliant theres no prizes for looking after your half mad sister stopping her blowing up the house every other day .But he did all right for a few weeks .till he came .And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforths face .Grindelwald .And at last my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented as he was .And looking after Ariana took a backseat then while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows and whatever else it was they were so interested in .Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind and if one young girl got neglected what did that matter when Albus was working for the greater good ?But after a few weeks of it Id had enough I had .It was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts so I told em both of em facetoface like I am to you now and Aberforth looked down at Harry and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager wiry and angry confronting his elder brother .I told him youd better give it up now .You cant move her shes in no fit state you cant take her with you wherever it is youre planning to go when youre making your clever speeches trying to whip yourselves up a following .He didnt like that said Aberforth and his eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses They shone white and blind again .Grindelwald didnt like that at all .He got angry .He told me what a stupid little boy I was trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother .Didnt I understand my poor sister wouldnt have to be hidden once theyd changed the world and led the wizards out of hiding and taught the Muggles their place ?And there was an argument .and I pulled out my wand and he pulled out his and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brothers best friend and Albus was trying to stop him and then all three of us were dueling and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off she couldnt stand it The color was draining from Aberforth s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound .and I think she wanted to help but she didnt really know what she was doing and I dont know which of us did it it could have been any of us and she was dead .His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair .Hermiones face was wet with tears and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth .Harry felt nothing but revulsion He wished he had not heard it wished he could wash his mind clean of it .Im so .Im so sorry Hermione whispered .Gone croaked Aberforth .Gone forever .He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat .Course Grindelwald scarpered .He had a bit of a track record already back in his own country and he didnt want Ariana set to his account too .And Albus was free wasnt he ?Free of the burden of his sister free to become the greatest wizard of the He was never free said Harry .I beg your pardon ?said Aberforth .Never said Harry .The night that your brother died he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind .He started screaming pleading with someone who wasnt there . ‘Dont hurt them please .hurt me instead .Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry .He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly .He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald I know he did said Harry remembering Dumbledore whimpering pleading .He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana .It was torture to him if youd seen him then you wouldnt say he was free .Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands .After a long pause he said How can you be sure Potter that my brother wasnt more interested in the greater good than in you ?How can you be sure you arent dispensable just like my little sister ?A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harrys heart .I dont believe it .Dumbledore loved Harry said Hermione .Why didnt he tell him to hide then ?shot back Aberforth .Why didnt he say to him Take care of yourself heres how to survive ?Because said Harry before Hermione could answer sometimes youve got to think about more than your own safety !Sometimes youve got to think about the greater good !This is war !Youre seventeen boy !Im of age and Im going to keep fighting even if youve given up !Who says Ive given up ?The Order of the Phoenix is finished Harry repeated .Tou Know Whos won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves .I dont say I like it but its the truth !No it isnt said Harry .Your brother knew how to finish YouKnowWho and he passed the knowledge on to me .Im going to keep going until I succeed or I die .Dont think I dont know how this might end .Ive known it for years .He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue but he did not .He merely scowled .We need to get into Hogwarts said Harry again .If you cant help us well wait till daybreak leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves .If you can help us well now would be a great time to mention it .Aberforth remained fixed in his chair gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brothers .At last he cleared his throat got to his feet walked around the little table and approached the portrait of Ariana .You know what to do he said .She smiled turned and walked away not as people in portraits usually did out of the sides of their frames but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her .They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness .Er what ?began Ron .Theres only one way in now said Aberforth .You must know theyve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends dementors all around the boundary walls regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me .The place has never been so heavily guarded .How you expect to do anything once you get inside it with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies .well thats your lookout isnt it ?You say youre prepared to die .But what . ?said Hermione frowning at Arianas picture .A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel and now Ariana was walking back toward them growing bigger and bigger as she came .But there was somebody else with her now someone taller than she was who was limping along looking excited .His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn .Larger and larger the two figures grew until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait .Then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little door and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed .And out of it his hair overgrown his face cut his robes ripped clambered the real Neville Longbottom who gave a roar of delight leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled I knew youd come !I knew it HarryY THE LOST DIADEM Neville what the how ?But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione and with yells of delight was hugging them too .The longer Harry looked at Neville the worse he appeared One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple there were gouge marks on his face and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough .Nevertheless his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again I knew youd come !Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time !Neville whats happened to you ?What ?This ?Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head .This is nothing .Seamus is worse .Youll see .Shall we get going then ?Oh he turned to Aberforth Ab there might be a couple more people on the way .Couple more ?repeated Aberforth ominously .What dyou mean a couple more Longbottom ?Theres a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole village !I know thats why theyll be Apparating directly into the bar said Neville .Just send them down the passage when they get here will you ?Thanks a lot .Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel Ron followed then Neville .Harry addressed Aberforth .I dont know how to thank you .Youve saved our lives twice .Look after em then said Aberforth gruffly .I might not be able to save em a third time .Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Arianas portrait .There were smooth stone steps on the other side It looked as though the passageway had been there for years .Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth as they walked their shadows rippled fanlike across the wall .How longs this been here ?Ron asked as they set off .It isnt on the Marauders Map is it Harry ?I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school ?They sealed off all of those before the start of the year said Neville .Theres no chance of getting through any of them now not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits .He started walking backward beaming drinking them in .Never mind that stuff .Is it true ?Did you break into Gringotts ?Did you escape on a dragon ?Its everywhere everyones talking about it Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner !Yeah its true said Harry .Neville laughed gleefully .What did you do with the dragon ?Released it into the wild said Ron .Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet Dont exaggerate Ron But what have you been doing ?People have been saying youve just been on the run Harry but I dont think so .I think youve been up to something .Youre right said Harry but tell us about Hogwarts Neville we havent heard anything .Its been .well its not really like Hogwarts anymore said Neville the smile fading from his face as he spoke .Do you know about the Carrows ?Those two Death Eaters who teach here ?They do more than teach said Neville .Theyre in charge of all discipline .They like punishment the Carrows .Like Umbridge ?Nah they make her look tame .The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong .They dont though if they can avoid it .You can tell they all hate them as much as we do .Amycus the bloke he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts except now its just the Dark Arts .Were supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people whove earned detentions What ?Harry Ron and Hermiones united voices echoed up and down the passage .Yeah said Neville .Thats how I got this one he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek I refused to do it .Some people are into it though Crabbe and Goyle love it .First time theyve ever been top in anything I expect .Alecto Amycuss sister teaches Muggle Studies which is compulsory for everyone .Weve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals stupid and dirty and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them and how the natural order is being reestablished .I got this one he indicated another slash to his face for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got .Blimey Neville said Ron theres a time and a place for getting a smart mouth .You didnt hear her said Neville .You wouldnt have stood it either .The thing is it helps when people stand up to them it gives everyone hope .I used to notice that when you did it Harry .But theyve used you as a knife sharpener said Ron wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Nevilles injuries were thrown into even greater relief .Neville shrugged .Doesnt matter .They dont want to spill too much pure blood so theyll torture us a bit if were mouthy but they wont actually kill us .Harry did not know what was worse the things that Neville was saying or the matteroffact tone in which he said them .The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble .They get taken hostage .Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quihhler so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas .Neville shes all right weve seen her Yeah I know she managed to get a message to me .From his pocket he pulled a golden coin and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledores Army had used to send one another messages .These have been great said Neville beaming at Hermione .The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating it drove them mad .We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls Dumbledores Army Still Recruiting stuff like that .Snape hated it .You used to ?said Harry who had noticed the past tense .Well it got more difficult as time went on said Neville .We lost Luna at Christmas and Ginny never came back after Easter and the three of us were sort of the leaders .The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it so they started coming down on me hard and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a firstyear theyd chained up and they tortured him pretty badly .That scared people off .No kidding muttered Ron as the passage began to slope upward .Yeah well I couldnt ask people to go through what Michael did so we dropped those kinds of stunts .But we were still fighting doing underground stuff right up until a couple of weeks ago .Thats when they decided there was only one way to stop me I suppose and they went for Gran .They what ?said Harry Ron and Hermione together .Yeah said Neville panting a little now because the passage was climbing so steeply well you can see their thinking .It had worked really well kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave I spose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around .Thing was he faced them and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran .Little old witch living alone they probably thought they didnt need to send anyone particularly powerful .Anyway Neville laughed Dawlish is still in St .Mungos and Grans on the run .She sent me a letter he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes telling me she was proud of me that Im my parents son and to keep it up .Cool said Ron .Yeah said Neville happily .Only thing was once they realized they had no hold over me they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all .I dont know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban either way I knew it was time to disappear .But said Ron looking thoroughly confused arent arent we heading straight back into Hogwarts ?Course said Neville .Youll see .Were here .They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage .Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Arianas portrait .Neville pushed it open and climbed through .As Harry followed he heard Neville call out to unseen people Look who it is !Didnt I tell you ?As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage there were several screams and yells HARRY !Its Potter its POTTER !Ron !Hermionel He had a confused impression of colored hangings of lamps and many faces .The next moment he Ron and Hermione were engulfed hugged pounded on the back their hair ruffled their hands shaken by what seemed to be more than twenty people They might just have won a Quidditch final .Okay okay calm down !Neville called and as the crowd backed away Harry was able to take in their surroundings .He did not recognize the room at all .It was enormous and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house or perhaps a gigantic ships cabin .Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark woodpaneled and windowless walls which were covered in bright tapestry hangings Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion emblazoned on scarlet the black badger of Hufflepuff set against yellow and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw on blue .The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent .There were bulging bookcases a few broomsticks propped against the walls and in the corner a large wooden cased wireless .Where are we ?Room of Requirement of course !said Neville .Surpassed itself hasnt it ?The Carrows were chasing me and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout I managed to get through the door and this is what I found !Well it wasnt exactly like this when I arrived it was a load smaller there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings .But its expanded as more and more of the D .A .have arrived .And the Carrows cant get in ?asked Harry looking around for the door .No said Seamus Finnigan whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke Seamuss face was bruised and puffy .Its a proper hideout as long as one of us stays in here they cant get at us the door wont open .Its all down to Neville .He really gets this room .Youve got to ask it for exactly what you need like ‘I dont want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in and itll do it for you !Youve just got to make sure you close the loopholes !Nevilles the man !Its quite straightforward really said Neville modestly .Id been in here about a day and a half and getting really hungry and wishing I could get something to eat and thats when the passage to the Hogs Head opened up .I went through it and met Aberforth .Hes been providing us with food because for some reason thats the one thing the room doesnt really do .Yeah well foods one of the five exceptions to Gamps Law of Elemental Transfiguration said Ron to general astonishment .So weve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks said Seamus and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up and thought theyd quite like to wash yes supplied Lavender Brown whom Harry had not noticed until that point .Now that he looked around properly he recognized many familiar faces .Both Patil twins were there as were Terry Boot Ernie Macmillan Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner .Tell us what youve been up to though said Ernie .Thereve been so many rumors weve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch .He pointed at the wireless .You didnt break into Gringotts ?They did !said Neville .And the dragons true too !There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops Ron took a bow .What were you after ?asked Seamus eagerly .Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own Harry felt a terrible scorching pain in the lightning scar .As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces the Room of Requirement vanished and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole and Voldemorts scream of fury vibrated inside his head .With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemorts mind again back to where he stood swaying in the Room of Requirement sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up .Are you all right Harry ?Neville was saying .Want to sit down ?I expect youre tired arent ?No said Harry .He looked at Ron and Hermione trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes .Time was running out fast If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next they would miss their chance .We need to get going he said and their expressions told him that they understood .What are we going to do then Harry ?asked Seamus .Whats the plan ?Plan ?repeated Harry .He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemorts rage His scar was still burning .Well theres something we Ron Hermione and I need to do and then well get out of here .Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore .Neville looked confused .What dyou mean ‘get out of here ?We havent come back to stay said Harry rubbing his scar trying to soothe the pain .Theres something important we need to do What is it ?I I cant tell you .There was a ripple of muttering at this Nevilles brows contracted .Why cant you tell us ?Its something to do with fighting YouKnowWho right ?Well yeah Then well help you .The other members of Dumbledores Army were nodding some enthusiastically others solemnly .A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action .You dont understand .Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours .We we cant tell you .Weve got to do it alone .Why ?asked Neville .Because .In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts .His scar was still searing .Dumbledore left the three of us a job he said carefully and we werent supposed to tell I mean he wanted us to do it just the three of us .Were his army said Neville .Dumbledores Army .We were all in it together weve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own It hasnt exactly been a picnic mate said Ron .I never said it had but I dont see why you cant trust us .Everyone in this rooms been fighting and theyve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down .Everyone in heres proven theyre loyal to Dumbledore loyal to you .Look Harry began without knowing what he was going to say but it did not matter The tunnel door had just opened behind him .We got your message Neville !Hello you three I thought you must be here !It was Luna and Dean .Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend .Hi everyone !said Luna happily .Oh its great to be back !Luna said Harry distractedly what are you doing here ?How did you ?I sent for her said Neville holding up the fake Galleon .I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up Id let them know .We all thought that if you came back it would mean revolution .That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows .Of course thats what it means said Luna brightly .Isnt it Harry ?Were going to fight them out of Hogwarts ?Listen said Harry with a rising sense of panic Im sorry but thats not what we came back for .Theres something weve got to do and then Youre going to leave us in this mess ?demanded Michael Corner .No !said Ron .What were doing will benefit everyone in the end its all about trying to get rid of YouKnowWho Then let us help !said Neville angrily .We want to be a part of it !There was another noise behind them and Harry turned .His heart seemed to fail Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall closely followed by Fred George and Lee Jordan .Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile He had forgotten or had never fully appreciated how beautiful she was but he had never been less pleased to see her .Aberforths getting a bit annoyed said Fred raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting .He wants a kip and his bars turned into a railway station .Harrys mouth fell open .Right behind Lee Jordan came Harrys old girlfriend Cho Chang .She smiled at him .I got the message she said holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner .So whats the plan Harry ?said George .There isnt one said Harry still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely .Just going to make it up as we go along are we ?My favorite kind said Fred .Youve got to stop this !Harry told Neville .What did you call them all back for ?This is insane Were fighting arent we ?said Dean taking out his fake Galleon .The message said Harry was back and we were going to fight !Ill have to get a wand though You havent got a wand ?began Seamus .Ron turned suddenly to Harry .Why cant they help ?What ?They can help .He dropped his voice and said so that none of them could hear but Hermione who stood between them We dont know where it is .Weve got to find it fast .We dont have to tell them its a Horcrux .Harry looked from Ron to Hermione who murmured I think Rons right .We dont even know what were looking for we need them .And when Harry looked unconvinced You dont have to do everything alone Harry .Harry thought fast his scar still prickling his head threatening to split again .Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes .Secrets and lies thats how we grew up and Albus .he was a natural .Was he turning into Dumbledore keeping his secrets clutched to his chest afraid to trust ?But Dumbledore had trusted Snape and where had that led ?To murder at the top of the highest tower .All right he said quietly to the other two .Okay he called to the room at large and all noise ceased Fred and George who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest fell silent and all of them looked alert excited .Theres something we need to find Harry said .Something something thatll help us overthrow YouKnowWho .Its here at Hogwarts but we dont know where .It might have belonged to Ravenclaw .Has anyone heard of an object like that ?Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it for instance ?He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws to Padma Michael Terry and Cho but it was Luna who answered perched on the arm of Ginnys chair .Well theres her lost diadem .I told you about it remember Harry ?The lost diadem of Ravenclaw ?Daddys trying to duplicate it .Yeah but the lost diadem said Michael Corner rolling his eyes is lost Luna .Thats sort of the point .When was it lost ?asked Harry .Centuries ago they say said Cho and Harrys heart sank .Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself .People have looked but she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws nobodys ever found a trace of it have they ?They all shook their heads .Sorry but what is a diadem ?asked Ron .Its a kind of crown said Terry Boot .Ravenclaws was supposed to have magical properties enhance the wisdom of the wearer .Yes Daddys Wrackspurt siphons But Harry cut across Luna .And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it ?They all shook their heads again .Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him .An object that had been lost this long and apparently without trace did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle .Before he could formulate a new question however Cho spoke again .If youd like to see what the diadems supposed to look like I could take you up to our common room and show you Harry ?Ravenclaws wearing it in her statue .Harrys scar scorched again For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders .Voldemort was flying again whether to the underground lake or here to the castle he did not know Either way there was hardly any time left .Hes on the move he said quietly to Ron and Hermione .He glanced at Cho and then back at them .Listen I know its not much of a lead but Im going to go and look at this statue at least find out what the diadem looks like .Wait for me here and keep you know the other one safe .Cho had got to her feet but Ginny said rather fiercely No Luna will take Harry wont you Luna ?Oooh yes Id like to said Luna happily and Cho sat down again looking disappointed .How do we get out ?Harry asked Neville .Over here .He led Harry and Luna to a corner where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase .It comes out somewhere different every day so theyve never been able to find it he said .Only trouble is we never know exactly where were going to end up when we go out .Be careful Harry theyre always patrolling the corridors at night .No problem said Harry .See you in a bit .He and Luna hurried up the staircase which was long lit by torches and turned corners in unexpected places .At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall .Get under here Harry told Luna pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them .He gave the wall a little push .It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once .They were standing in a dark corridor Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows fumbled in the pouch around his neck and took out the Marauders Map .Holding it close to his nose he searched and located his and Lunas dots at last .Were up on the fifth floor he whispered watching Filch moving away from them a corridor ahead .Come on this way .They crept off .Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before but never had his heart hammered this fast never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place .Through squares of moonlight upon the floor past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps around corners beyond which who knew what lurked Harry and Luna walked checking the Marauders Map whenever light permitted twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves .He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment his worst fear was Peeves and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first telltale signs of the poltergeists approach .This way Harry breathed Luna plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase .They climbed in tight dizzying circles Harry had never been up here before .At last they reached a door .There was no handle and no keyhole nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle .Luna reached out a pale hand which looked eerie floating in midair unconnected to arm or body .She knocked once and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast .At once the beak of the eagle opened but instead of a birds call a soft musical voice said Which came first the phoenix or the flame ?Hmm .What do you think Harry ?said Luna looking thoughtful .What ?Isnt there just a password ?Oh no youve got to answer a question said Luna .What if you get it wrong ?Well you have to wait for somebody who gets it right said Luna .That way you learn you see ?Yeah .Trouble is we cant really afford to wait for anyone else Luna .No I see what you mean said Luna seriously .Well then I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning .Well reasoned said the voice and the door swung open .The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide circular room airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts .Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls which were hung with blueandbronze silks By day the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains .The ceiling was domed and painted with stars which were echoed in the midnightblue carpet .There were tables chairs and bookcases and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble .Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Lunas house .The statue stood beside a door that led he guessed to dormitories above .He strode right up to the marble woman and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face beautiful yet slightly intimidating .A delicate  looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head .It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding .There were tiny words etched into it .Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaws plinth to read them . ‘Wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure .Which makes you pretty skint witless said a cackling voice .Harry whirled around slipped off the plinth and landed on the floor .The slopingshouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him and even as Harry raised his wand she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm .THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE The moment her finger touched the Mark Harrys scar burned savagely the starry room vanished from sight and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff and the sea was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart They have the boy .A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood Disoriented he raised his wand but the witch before him was already falling forward she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled .Ive never Stunned anyone except in our D .A .lessons said Luna sounding mildly interested .That was noisier than I thought it would be .And sure enough the ceiling had begun to tremble .Scurrying echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories Lunas spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above .Luna where are you ?I need to get under the Cloak !Lunas feet appeared out of nowhere he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws all in their nightclothes flooded into the common room .There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious .Slowly they shuffled in around her a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them .Then one brave little first year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe .I think she might be dead !he shouted with delight .Oh look whispered Luna happily as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto .Theyre pleased !Yeah .great .Harry closed his eyes and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemorts mind .He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave .He had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming .but that would not take him long .There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze .From the other side Harry heard the soft musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker Where do Vanished objects go ?I dunno do I ?Shut it !snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother Amycus .Alecto ?Alecto ?Are you there ?Have you got him ?Open the door !The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves terrified .Then without warning there came a series of loud bangs as though somebody was firing a gun into the door .ALECTO If he comes and we havent got Potter dyou want to go the same way as the Malfoys ?ANSWER ME !Amyous bellowed shaking the door for all he was worth but still it did not open .The Ravenclaws were all backing away and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds .Then just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else a second most familiar voice rang out beyond the door .May I ask what you are doing Professor Carrow ?Trying to get through this damned door !shouted Amycus .Go and get Flitwick !Get him to open it now !But isnt your sister in there ?asked Professor McGonagall .Didnt Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening at your urgent request ?Perhaps she could open the door for you ?Then you neednt wake up half the castle .She aint answering you old besom !You open it !Garn !Do it now !Certainly if you wish it said Professor McGonagall with awful coldness .There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again Where do Vanished objects go ?Into nonbeing which is to say everything replied Professor McGonagall .Nicely phrased replied the eagle door knocker and the door swung open .The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold brandishing his wand .Hunched like his sister he had a pallid doughy face and tiny eyes which fell at once on Alecto sprawled motionless on the floor .He let out a yell of fury and fear .Whatve they done the little whelps ?he screamed .Ill Cruciate the lot of em till they tell me who did it and whats the Dark Lord going to say ?he shrieked standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist .We havent got him and theyve gorn and killed her !Shes only Stunned said Professor McGonagall impatiently who had stooped down to examine Alecto .Shell be perfectly all right .No she bludgering well wont !bellowed Amycus .Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her !Shes gorn and sent for him I felt me Mark burn and he thinks weve got Potter ! ‘Got Potter ?said Professor McGonagall sharply .What do you mean ‘got Potter ?He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower and to send for him if we caught him !Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower ?Potter belongs in my House !Beneath the disbelief and anger Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him .We was told he might come in here !said Carrow .I dunno why do I ?Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room .Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood .We can push it off on the kids said Amycus his piglike face suddenly crafty .Yeah thats what well do .Well say Alecto was ambushed by the kids them kids up there he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories and well say they forced her to press her Mark and thats why he got a false alarm .He can punish them .Couple of kids more or less whats the difference ?Only the difference between truth and lies courage and cowardice said Professor McGonagall who had turned pale a difference in short which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate .But let me make one thing very clear .You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts .I shall not permit it .Excuse me ?Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall his face within inches of hers .She refused to back away but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat .Its not a case of what youll permit Minerva McGonagall .Your times over .Its us whats in charge here now and youll back me up or youll pay the price .And he spat in her face .Harry pulled the Cloak off himself raised his wand and said You shouldnt have done that .As Amycus spun around Harry shouted Crucio The Death Eater was lifted off his feet .He writhed through the air like a drowning man thrashing and howling in pain and then with a crunch and a shattering of glass he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled insensible to the floor .I see what Bellatrix meant said Harry the blood thundering through his brain you need to really mean it .Potter !whispered Professor McGonagall clutching her heart .Potter youre here !What ?How ?She struggled to pull herself together .Potter that was foolish !He spat at you said Harry .Potter I that was very very gallant of you but dont you realize ?Yeah I do Harry assured her .Somehow her panic steadied him .Professor McGonagall Voldemorts on the way .Oh are we allowed to say the name now ?asked Luna with an air of interest pulling off the Invisibility Cloak .This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown .I dont think it makes any difference what we call him Harry told Luna .He already knows where I am .In a distant part of Harrys brain that part connected to the angry burning scar he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat .He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood .You must flee whispered Professor McGonagall .Now Potter as quickly as you can !I cant said Harry .Theres something I need to do .Professor do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is ?The ddiadem of Ravenclaw ?Of course not hasnt it been lost for centuries ?She sat up a little straighter .Potter it was madness utter madness for you to enter this castle I had to said Harry .Professor theres something hidden here that Im supposed to find and it could be the diadem if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick There was a sound of movement of clinking glass Amycus was coming round .Before Harry or Luna could act Professor McGonagall rose to her feet pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater and said Imperio .Amycus got up walked over to his sister picked up her wand then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own .Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto .Professor McGonagall waved her wand again and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows binding them tightly together .Potter said Professor McGonagall turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows predicament if HeWhoMustNotBeNamed does indeed know that you are here As she said it a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry setting his scar on fire and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface Potter are you all right ?said a voice and Harry came back He was clutching Lunas shoulder to steady himself .Times running out Voldemorts getting nearer .Professor Im acting on Dumbledores orders I must find what he wanted me to find !But weve got to get the students out while Im searching the castle its me Voldemort wants but he wont care about killing a few more or less not now not now he knows Im attacking Horcruxes Harry finished the sentence in his head .Youre acting on Dumbledores orders ?she repeated with a look of dawning wonder .Then she drew herself up to her fullest height .We shall secure the school against HeWhoMust NotBeNamed while you search for this this object .Is that possible ?I think so said Professor McGonagall dryly we teachers are rather good at magic you know .I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it .Of course something will have to be done about Professor Snape Let me and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege with the Dark Lord at the gates it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible .With the Floo Network under observation and Apparition impossible within the grounds Theres a way said Harry quickly and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hogs Head .Potter were talking about hundreds of students I know Professor but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they wont be interested in anyone whos Disapparating out of the Hogs Head .Theres something in that she agreed .She pointed her wand at the Carrows and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies tied itself around them and hoisted them into the air where they dangled beneath the blueandgold ceiling like two large ugly sea creatures .Come .We must alert the other Heads of House .Youd better put that Cloak back on .She marched toward the door and as she did so she raised her wand .From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes .The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead filling the spiral staircase with silvery light as Professor McGonagall Harry and Luna hurried back down .Along the corridors they raced and one by one the Patronuses left them Professor McGonagalls tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak .They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs .Harry whose scar was still prickling heard them first He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauders Map but before he could take it out McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company .She halted raised her wand ready to duel and said Whos there ?It is I said a low voice .From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape .Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him He had forgotten the details of Snape s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face how his black eyes had a dead cold look .He was not wearing nightclothes but was dressed in his usual black cloak and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight .Where are the Carrows ?he asked quietly .Wherever you told them to be I expect Severus said Professor McGonagall .Snape stepped nearer and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her as if he knew that Harry was there .Harry held his wand up too ready to attack .I was under the impression said Snape that Alecto had apprehended an intruder .Really ?said Professor McGonagall .And what gave you that impression ?Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin .Oh but naturally said Professor McGonagall .You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication I forgot .Snape pretended not to have heard her .His eyes were still probing the air all about her and he was moving gradually closer with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing .I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva .You have some objection ?I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour ?I thought I heard a disturbance said Professor McGonagall .Really ?But all seems calm .Snape looked into her eyes .Have you seen Harry Potter Minerva ?Because if you have I must insist Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple unconscious but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance .She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket Harry about to curse Snape was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape Then it was no longer fire but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke which reformed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him and with echoing clangs the daggers sank one after another into its breast Minerva !said a squeaky voice and looking behind him still shielding Luna from flying spells Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear .No !squealed Flitwick raising his wand .Youll do no more murder at Hogwarts !Flitwicks spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter With a clatter it came to life .Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered .When Harry looked up again Snape was in full flight McGonagall Flitwick and Sprout all thundering after him He hurtled through a classroom door and moments later he heard McGonagall cry Coward !COWARD !Whats happened whats happened ?asked Luna .Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall Flitwick and Sprout were standing at a smashed window .He jumped said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room .You mean hes dead ?Harry sprinted to the window ignoring Flitwicks and Sprouts yells of shock at his sudden appearance .No hes not dead said McGonagall bitterly .Unlike Dumbledore he was still carrying a wand .and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master .With a tingle of horror Harry saw in the distance a huge batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall .There were heavy footfalls behind them and a great deal of puffing Slughorn had just caught up .Harry !he panted massaging his immense chest beneath his emeraldgreen silk pajamas .My dear boy .what a surprise .Minerva do please explain . .Severus .what . ?Our headmaster is taking a short break said Professor McGonagall pointing at the Snapeshaped hole in the window .Professor !Harry shouted his hands at his forehead .He could see the Inferifilled lake sliding beneath him and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart Professor weve got to barricade the school hes coming now !Very well .HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is coming she told the other teachers .Sprout and Flitwick gasped Slughorn let out a low groan .Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledores orders .We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do .You realize of course that nothing we do will be able to keep out YouKnowWho indefinitely ?squeaked Flitwick .But we can hold him up said Professor Sprout .Thank you Pomona said Professor McGonagall and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding .I suggest we establish basic protection around the place then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall .Most must be evacuated though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight I think they ought to be given the chance .Agreed said Professor Sprout already hurrying toward the door .I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House .And as she jogged out of sight they could hear her muttering Tentacula .Devils Snare .And Snargaluff pods .yes Id like to see the Death Eaters fighting those .I can act from here said Flitwick and although he could barely see out of it he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity .Harry heard a weird rushing noise as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds .Professor Harry said approaching the little Charms master Professor Im sorry to interrupt but this is important .Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is ?Protego Horribilis the diadem of Ravenclaw ?squeaked Flitwick .A little extra wisdom never goes amiss Potter but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation !I only meant do you know where it is ?Have you ever seen it ?Seen it ?Nobody has seen it in living memory !Long since lost boy !Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic .What then was the Horcrux ?We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall Filius !said Professor McGonagall beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her .They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech .My word he puffed pale and sweaty his walrus mustache aquiver .What a todo !Im not at all sure whether this is wise Minerva .He is bound to find a way in you know and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also said Professor McGonagall .If you wish to leave with your students we shall not stop you .But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle then Horace we duel to kill .Minerva !he said aghast .The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties interrupted Professor McGonagall .Go and wake your students Horace .Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter He and Luna ran after Professor McGonagall who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand .Piertotum oh for heavens sake Filch not now The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view shouting Students out of bed !Students in the corridors !Theyre supposed to be you blithering idiot !shouted McGonagall .Now go and do something constructive !Find Peeves !PPeeves ?stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before .Yes Peeves you fool Peevesl Havent you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century ?Go and fetch him at once !Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses but hobbled away hunch shouldered muttering under his breath .And now Piertotum Locomotori cried Professor McGonagall .And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same .Hogwarts is threatened !shouted Professor McGonagall .Man the boundaries protect us do your duty to our school !Clattering and yelling the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry some of them smaller others larger than life .There were animals too and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains .Now Potter said McGonagall you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall I shall rouse the other Gryffindors .They parted at the top of the next staircase Harry and Luna running back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement .As they ran they met crowds of students most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects .That was Potter !Harry Potted It was him I swear I just saw him !But Harry did not look back and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement .Harry leaned against the enchanted wall which opened to admit them and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase .Wh ?As the room came into view Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock .It was packed far more crowded than when he had last been in there .Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him as were Oliver Wood Katie Bell Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet Bill and Fleur and Mr and Mrs Weasley .Harry whats happening ?said Lupin meeting him at the foot of the stairs .Voldemorts on his way theyre barricading the school Snapes run for it What are you doing here ?How did you know ?We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledores Army Fred explained .You couldnt expect everyone to miss the fun Harry and the D .A .let the Order of the Phoenix know and it all kind of snowballed .What first Harry ?called George .Whats going on ?Theyre evacuating the younger kids and everyones meeting in the Great Hall to get organized Harry said .Were fighting .There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix Dumbledores Army and Harrys old Quidditch team all with their wands drawn heading up into the main castle .Come on Luna Dean called as he passed holding out his free hand she took it and followed him back up the stairs .The crowd was thinning Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement and Harry joined them .Mrs Weasley was struggling with Ginny .Around them stood Lupin Fred George Bill and Fleur .Youre underage !Mrs Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached .I wont permit it !The boys yes but you youve got to go home !I wont !Ginnys hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mothers grip .Im in Dumbledores Army A teenagers gang !A teenagers gang thats about to take him on which no one else has dared to do !said Fred .Shes sixteen !shouted Mrs Weasley .Shes not old enough !What you two were thinking bringing her with you Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves .Mums right Ginny said Bill gently .You cant do this .Everyone underage will have to leave its only right .I cant go home !Ginny shouted angry tears sparkling in her eyes .My whole familys here I cant stand waiting there alone and not knowing and Her eyes met Harrys for the first time .She looked at him beseechingly but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly .Fine she said staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hogs Head .Ill say goodbye now then and There was a scuffling and a great thump Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel overbalanced slightly and fallen .He pulled himself up on the nearest chair looked around through lopsided horn rimmed glasses and said Am I too late ?Has it started ?I only just found out so I I Percy spluttered into silence .Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family .There was a long moment of astonishment broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension So ow eez leetle Teddy ?Lupin blinked at her startled .The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying like ice .I oh yes hes fine !Lupin said loudly .Yes Tonks is with him at her mothers Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another frozen .Here Ive got a picture !Lupin shouted pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair waving fat fists at the camera .I was a fool !Percy roared so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph .I was an idiot I was a pompous prat I was a a Ministryloving familydisowning powerhungry moron said Fred .Percy swallowed .Yes I was !Well you cant say fairer than that said Fred holding out his hand to Percy .Mrs Weasley burst into tears .She ran forward pushed Fred aside and pulled Percy into a strangling hug while he patted her on the back his eyes on his father .Im sorry Dad Percy said .Mr Weasley blinked rather rapidly then he too hurried to hug his son .What made you see sense Perce ?inquired George .Its been coming on for a while said Percy mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak .But I had to find a way out and its not so easy at the Ministry theyre imprisoning traitors all the time .I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it so here I am .Well we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these said George in a good imitation of Percys most pompous manner .Now lets get upstairs and fight or all the good Death Eatersll be taken .So youre my sisterinlaw now ?said Percy shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill Fred and George .Ginny !barked Mrs Weasley .Ginny had been attempting under cover of the reconciliation to sneak upstairs too .Molly how about this said Lupin .Why doesnt Ginny stay here then at least shell be on the scene and know whats going on but she wont be in the middle of the fighting ?Thats a good idea said Mr Weasley firmly .Ginny you stay in this room you hear me ?Ginny did not seem to like the idea much but under her fathers unusually stern gaze she nodded .Mr and Mrs Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well .Wheres Ron ?asked Harry .Wheres Hermione ?They must have gone up to the Great Hall already Mr Weasley called over his shoulder .I didnt see them pass me said Harry .They said something about a bathroom said Ginny not long after you left .A bathroom ?Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond .It was empty .Youre sure they said bath ?But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished He was looking through the high wroughtiron gates with winged boars on pillars at either side looking through the dark grounds toward the castle which was ablaze with lights .Nagini lay draped over his shoulders .He was possessed of that cold cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder .THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students some in traveling cloaks others in dressing gowns .Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts .Every eye living and dead was fixed upon Professor McGonagall who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall .Behind her stood the remaining teachers including the palomino centaur Firenze and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight . .evacuation will be overseen by Mr Filch and Madam Pomfrey .Prefects when I give the word you will organize your House and take your charges in an orderly fashion to the evacuation point .Many of the students looked petrified .However as Harry skirted the walls scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted And what if we want to stay and fight ?There was a smattering of applause .If you are of age you may stay said Professor McGonagall .What about our things ?called a girl at the Ravenclaw table .Our trunks our owls ?We have no time to collect possessions said Professor McGonagall .The important thing is to get you out of here safely .Wheres Professor Snape ?shouted a girl from the Slytherin table .He has to use the common phrase done a bunk replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws .Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table still looking for Ron and Hermione .As he passed faces turned in his direction and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake .We have already placed protection around the castle Professor McGonagall was saying but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it .I must ask you therefore to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall .It was high cold and clear There was no telling from where it came it seemed to issue from the walls themselves .Like the monster it had once commanded it might have lain dormant there for centuries .I know that you are preparing to fight .There were screams amongst the students some of whom clutched each other looking around in terror for the source of the sound .Your efforts are futile .You cannot fight me .I do not want to kill you .I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts .I do not want to spill magical blood .There was silence in the Hall now the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums that seems too huge to be contained by walls .Give me Harry Potter said Voldemorts voice and none shall be harmed .Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched .Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded .You have until midnight .The silence swallowed them all again .Every head turned every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams .Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed But hes there !Potters there Someone grab him !Before Harry could speak there was a massive movement .The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing not Harry but the Slytherins .Then the Hufflepuffs stood and almost at the same moment the Ravenclaws all of them with their backs to Harry all of them looking toward Pansy instead and Harry awestruck and overwhelmed saw wands emerging everywhere pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves .Thank you Miss Parkinson said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice .You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch .If the rest of your House could follow .Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall .Ravenclaws follow on !cried Professor McGonagall .Slowly the four tables emptied .The Slytherin table was completely deserted but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats necessitating Professor McGonagalls descent from the teachers platform to chivvy the underage on their way .Absolutely not Creevey go !And you Peakes !Harry hurried over to the Weasleys all sitting together at the Gryffindor table .Where are Ron and Hermione ?Havent you found ?began Mr Weasley looking worried .But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind .Weve only got half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast !A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix .Professors Flitwick Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers Ravenclaw Astronomy and Gryffindor where theyll have a good overview excellent positions from which to work spells .Meanwhile Remus he indicated Lupin Arthur he pointed toward Mr Weasley sitting at the Gryffindor table and I will take groups into the grounds .Well need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school Sounds like a job for us called Fred indicating himself and George and Kingsley nodded his approval .All right leaders up here and well divide up the troops !Potter said Professor McGonagall hurrying up to him as students flooded the platform jostling for position receiving instructions Arent you supposed to be looking for something ?What ?Oh said Harry oh yeah !He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind .Then go Potter go !Right yeah He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students .He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor .Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes .He tried to calm himself to concentrate on finding the Horcrux but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass .Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas .He slowed down coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauders Map out of the pouch around his neck .He could not see Rons or Hermiones names anywhere on it though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might he thought be concealing them .He put the map away pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes trying to concentrate .Voldemort thought Id go to Ravenclaw Tower .There it was a solid fact the place to start .Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room and there could only be one explanation Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House .But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem .and how could the Horcrux be the diadem ?How was it possible that Voldemort the Slytherin had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws ?Who could have told him where to look when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory ?In living memory .Beneath his fingers Harrys eyes flew open again .He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come now in pursuit of his one last hope .The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs .Prefects were shouting instructions trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses there was much pushing and shoving Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over firstyears to get to the front of the queue here and there younger students were in tears while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings .Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor .Nick !NICK !I need to talk to you !He forced his way back through the tide of students finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where Nearly Headless Nick ghost of Gryffindor Tower stood waiting for him .Harry !My dear boy !Nick made to grasp Harrys hands with both of his own Harrys felt as though they had been thrust into icy water .Nick youve got to help me .Whos the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower ?Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended .The Gray Lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require ?Its got to be her dyou know where she is ?Lets see .Nicks head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither peering over the heads of the swarming students .Thats her over there Harry the young woman with the long hair .Harry looked in the direction of Nicks transparent pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her raised her eyebrows and drifted away through a solid wall .Harry ran after her .Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared he saw her at the very end of the passage still gliding smoothly away from him .Hey wait come back !She consented to pause floating a few inches from the ground .Harry supposed that she was beautiful with her waistlength hair and floorlength cloak but she also looked haughty and proud .Close to he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor but to whom he had never spoken .Youre the Gray Lady ?She nodded but did not speak .The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower ?That is correct .Her tone was not encouraging .Please I need some help .I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem .A cold smile curved her lips .I am afraid she said turning to leave that I cannot help you .WAIT !He had not meant to shout but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him .He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him It was a quarter to midnight .This is urgent he said fiercely .If that diadems at Hogwarts Ive got to find it fast .You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem she said disdainfully .Generations of students have badgered me This isnt about trying to get better marks !Harry shouted at her .Its about Voldemort defeating Voldemort or arent you interested in that ?She could not blush but her transparent cheeks became more opaque and her voice was heated as she replied Of course I how dare you suggest ?Well help me then !Her composure was slipping .It it is not a question of she stammered .My mothers diadem Your mothers ?She looked angry with herself .When I lived she said stiffly I was Helena Ravenclaw .Youre her daughter ?But then you must know what happened to it !While the diadem bestows wisdom she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord Havent I just told you Im not interested in wearing it !Harry said fiercely .Theres no time to explain but if you care about Hogwarts if you want to see Voldemort finished youve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem !She remained quite still floating in midair staring down at him and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry .Of course if she had known anything she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore who had surely asked her the same question .He had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice .I stole the diadem from my mother .You you did what ?I stole the diadem repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper .I sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother .I ran away with it .He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask he simply listened hard as she went on My mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still .She concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of Hogwarts .Then my mother fell ill fatally ill .In spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time .She sent a man who had long loved me though I spurned his advances to find me .She knew that he would not rest until he had done so .Harry waited .She drew a deep breath and threw back her head .He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding .When I refused to return with him he became violent .The Baron was always a hottempered man .Furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me .The Baron ?You mean ?The Bloody Baron yes said the Gray Lady and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest .When he saw what he had done he was overcome with remorse .He took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself .All these centuries later he wears his chains as an act of penitence .as he should she added bitterly .And .and the diadem ?It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me .Concealed inside a hollow tree .A hollow tree ?repeated Harry .What tree ?Where was this ?A forest in Albania .A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mothers reach .Albania repeated Harry .Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick .Youve already told someone this story havent you ?Another student ?She closed her eyes and nodded .I had .no idea .He was .flattering .He seemed to .to understand .to sympathize .Yes Harry thought Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaws desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right .Well you werent the first person Riddle wormed things out of Harry muttered .He could be charming when he wanted .So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray Lady .He had traveled to that farflung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes .And wouldnt those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when so much later Voldemort had needed a place to lie low undisturbed for ten long years ?But the diadem once it became his precious Horcrux had not been left in that lowly tree .No the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home and Voldemort must have put it there the night he asked for a job !said Harry finishing his thought .I beg your pardon ?He hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach !said Harry .Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all .He mustve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from Dumbledore s office !But it was still worth trying to get the job then he mightve got the chance to nick Gryffindors sword as well thank you thanks !Harry left her floating there looking utterly bewildered .As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall he checked his watch .It was five minutes until midnight and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was he was no closer to discovering where it was .Generations of students had failed to find the diadem that suggested that it was not in Ravenclaw Tower but if not there where ?What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle that he believed would remain secret forever ?Lost in desperate speculation Harry turned a corner but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening shattering crash .As he leapt aside a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall .Something large and furry detached itself whimpering from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry .Hagrid !Harry bellowed fighting off Fang the boarhounds attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet .What the ?Harry yer here !Yer here Hagrid stooped down bestowed upon Harry a cursory and ribcracking hug then ran back to the shattered window .Good boy Grawpy !he bellowed through the hole in the window .Ill see yer in a moment theres a good lad !Beyond Hagrid out in the dark night Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird keening scream .He looked down at his watch It was midnight .The battle had begun .Blimey Harry panted Hagrid this is it eh ?Time ter fight ?Hagrid where have you come from ?Heard YouKnowWho from up in our cave said Hagrid grimly .Voice carried didn it ?Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter .Knew yeh mus be here knew what mus be happenin .Get down Fang .So we come ter join in me an Grawpy an Fang .Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest Grawpy was carryin us Fang an me .Told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him .Not exacly what I meant bu wheres Ron an Hermione ?That said Harry is a really good question .Come on .They hurried together along the corridor Fang lolloping beside them .Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around running footsteps shouts through the windows he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds .Wherere we goin ?puffed Hagrid pounding along at Harrys heels making the floorboards quake .I dunno exactly said Harry making another random turn but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere .The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window .Their remains stirred feebly on the floor and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads it moaned faintly Oh dont mind me .Ill just lie here and crumble .Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophiliuss house wearing that mad headdress and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower with the stone diadem upon her white curls .And as he reached the end of the passage the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him that of an ugly old warlock onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara .The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky and he nearly stumbled .He knew at last where the Horcrux sat waiting for him .Tom Riddle who confided in no one and operated alone might have been arrogant enough to assume that he and only he had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle .Of course Dumbledore and Flitwick those model pupils had never set foot in that particular place but he Harry had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew that Dumbledore had never discovered He was roused by Professor Sprout who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants .Mandrakes !Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran .Going to lob them over the walls they wont like this !Harry knew now where to go He sped off with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him .They passed portrait after portrait and the painted figures raced alongside them wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches in armor and cloaks cramming themselves into each others canvases screaming news from other parts of the castle .As they reached the end of this corridor the whole castle shook and Harry knew as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order .Its all righ Fang its all righ !yelled Hagrid but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog leaving Harry alone .He forged on through the trembling passages his wand at the ready and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight Sir Cadogan rushed from painting to painting beside him clanking along in his armor screaming encouragement his fat little pony cantering behind him .Braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out Harry Potter see them off !Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott standing beside another empty plinth whose statue had concealed a secret passageway .Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole .Nice night for it !Fred shouted as the castle quaked again and Harry sprinted by elated and terrified in equal measure .Along yet another corridor he dashed and then there were owls everywhere and Mrs Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws no doubt to return them to their proper place .Potter !Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead his wand held ready .Ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub Potter !I know were evacuating Harry said Voldemorts attacking because they havent handed you over yeah said Aberforth Im not deaf the whole of Hogsmeade heard him .And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage ?There are kids of Death Eaters youve just sent to safety .Wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here ?It wouldnt stop Voldemort said Harry and your brother would never have done it .Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction .Your brother would never have done it .Well it was the truth Harry thought as he ran on again Dumbledore who had defended Snape for so long would never have held students ransom .And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them Ron and Hermione both with their arms full of large curved dirty yellow objects Ron with a broomstick under his arm .Where the hell have you been ?Harry shouted .Chamber of Secrets said Ron .Chamber what ?said Harry coming to an unsteady halt before them .It was Ron all Rons idea !said Hermione breathlessly .Wasnt it absolutely brilliant ?There we were after you left and I said to Ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it ?We still hadnt got rid of the cup !And then he thought of it !The basilisk !What the ?Something to get rid of Horcruxes said Ron simply .Harrys eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermiones arms great curved fangs torn he now realized from the skull of a dead basilisk .But how did you get in there ?he asked staring from the fangs to Ron .You need to speak Parseltongue !He did !whispered Hermione .Show him Ron !Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise .Its what you did to open the locket he told Harry apologetically .I had to have a few goes to get it right but he shrugged modestly we got there in the end .He was amazing .said Hermione .Amazing !So .Harry was struggling to keep up .So .So were another Horcrux down said Ron and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuffs cup .Hermione stabbed it .Thought she should .She hasnt had the pleasure yet .Genius !yelled Harry .It was nothing said Ron though he looked delighted with himself .So whats new with you ?As he said it there was an explosion from overhead All three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream .I know what the diadem looks like and I know where it is said Harry talking fast .He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book where everyones been hiding stuff for centuries .He thought he was the only one to find it .Come on .As the walls trembled again he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement .It was empty except for three women Ginny Tonks and an elderly witch wearing a motheaten hat whom Harry recognized immediately as Nevilles grandmother .Ah Potter she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him .You can tell us whats going on .Is everyone okay ?said Ginny and Tonks together .S far as we know said Harry .Are there still people in the passage to the Hogs Head ?He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it .I was the last to come through said Mrs Longbottom .I sealed it I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub .Have you seen my grandson ?Hes fighting said Harry .Naturally said the old lady proudly .Excuse me I must go and assist him .With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps .Harry looked at Tonks .I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mothers ?I couldnt stand not knowing Tonks looked anguished .Shell look after him have you seen Remus ?He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds Without another word Tonks sped off .Ginny said Harry Im sorry but we need you to leave too .Just for a bit .Then you can come back in .Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary .And then you can come back in !he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks .Youve got to come back ini Hang on a moment !said Ron sharply .Weve forgotten someone !Who ?asked Hermione .The houseelves theyll all be down in the kitchen wont they ?You mean we ought to get them fighting ?asked Harry .No said Ron seriously I mean we should tell them to get out .We dont want any more Dobbies do we ?We cant order them to die for us There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione s arms .Running at Ron she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth .Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet .Is this the moment ?Harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice .01 !Theres a war going on here !Ron and Hermione broke apart their arms still around each other .I know mate said Ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger so its now or never isnt it ?Never mind that what about the Horcrux ?Harry shouted .Dyou think you could just just hold it in until weve got the diadem ?Yeah right sorry said Ron and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face .It was clear as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever dust filled the air and through the nearest window Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place .Looking down Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure .Lets hope he steps on some of them !said Ron as more screams echoed from close by .As long as its not any of our lot !said a voice Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks both with their wands drawn at the next window which was missing several panes .Even as he watched Ginny sent a well aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below .Good girl !roared a figure running through the dust toward them and Harry saw Aberforth again his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past .They look like they might be breaching the north battlements theyve brought giants of their own !Have you seen Remus ?Tonks called after him .He was dueling Dolohov shouted Aberforth havent seen him since !Tonks said Ginny Tonks Im sure hes okay But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth .Ginny turned helpless to Harry Ron and Hermione .Theyll be all right said Harry though he knew they were empty words .Ginny well be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe come on !he said to Ron and Hermione and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant .I need the place where everything is hidden Harry begged of it inside his head and the door materialized on their third run past .The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them All was silent .They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of longgone students .And he never realized anyone could get in ?said Ron his voice echoing in the silence .He thought he was the only one said Harry .Too bad for him Ive had to hide stuff in my time .this way he added I think its down here .He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequences then hesitated looking up and down aisles of junk he could not remember where to go next .Accio Diadem .cried Hermione in desperation but nothing flew through the air toward them .It seemed that like the vault at Gringotts the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily .Lets split up Harry told the other two .Look for a stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara !Its standing on a cupboard and its definitely somewhere near here .They sped off up adjacent aisles Harry could hear the others footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk of bottles hats crates chairs books weapons broomsticks bats .Somewhere near here Harry muttered to himself .Somewhere .somewhere .Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room .His breath was loud in his ears and then his very soul seemed to shiver There it was right ahead the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book and on top of it the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara .He had already stretched out his hand though he remained ten feet away when a voice behind him said Hold it Potter .He skidded to a halt and turned around .Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder wands pointing right at Harry .Through the small space between their leering faces he saw Draco Malfoy .Thats my wand youre holding Potter said Malfoy pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle .Not anymore panted Harry tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand .Winners keepers Malfoy .Whos lent you theirs ?My mother said Draco .Harry laughed though there was nothing very humorous about the situation .He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore .They seemed to have run out of earshot searching for the diadem .So how come you three arent with Voldemort ?asked Harry .Were gonna be rewarded said Crabbe His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before .Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets .We ung back Potter .We decided not to go .Decided to bring you to im .Good plan said Harry in mock admiration .He could not believe that he was this close and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle .He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust .If he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out .So how did you get in here ?he asked trying to distract them .I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year said Malfoy his voice brittle .I know how to get in .We was hiding in the corridor outside grunted Goyle .We can do Disslusion Charms now !And then his face split into a gormless grin you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a diedum !Whats a diedum ?Harry ?Rons voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harrys right .Are you talking to someone ?With a whiplike movement Crabbe pointed his wand at the fiftyfoot mountain of old furniture of broken trunks of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted DescendoV The wall began to totter then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood .Ron !Harry bellowed as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall He pointed his wand at the rampart cried Finite !and it steadied .No !shouted Malfoy staying Crabbes arm as the latter made to repeat his spell .If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing !Whats that matter ?said Crabbe tugging himself free .Its Potter the Dark Lord wants who cares about a diedum ?Potter came in here to get it said Malfoy with ill disguised impatience at the slowwittedness of his colleagues so that must mean ‘Must mean ?Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity .Who cares what you think ?I dont take your orders no more Draco .You an your dad are finished .Harry ?shouted Ron again from the other side of the junk wall .Whats going on ?Harry ?mimicked Crabbe .Whats going no Potter !Cruciol Harry had lunged for the tiara Crabbes curse missed him but hit the stone bust which flew into the air the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested .STOP !Malfoy shouted at Crabbe his voice echoing through the enormous room .The Dark Lord wants him alive So ?Im not killing him am I ?yelled Crabbe throwing off Malfoys restraining arm .But if I can I will the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway whats thediff ?A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe s head .It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way .Its that Mudblood !Avada Kedavral Harry saw Hermione dive aside and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind .He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe who lurched out of the way knocking Malfoys wand out of his hand it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes .Dont kill him !DONT KILL HIM !Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle who were both aiming at Harry Their split seconds hesitation was all Harry needed .Expelliarmusl Goyle s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot trying to retrieve it Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione s second Stunning Spell and Ron appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle shot a full BodyBind Curse at Crabbe which narrowly missed .Crabbe wheeled around and screamed Avada KedavraY again .Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light .The wandless Malfoy cowered behind a threelegged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came .Its somewhere here !Harry yelled at her pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen .Look for it while I go and help R HARRY !she screamed .A roaring billowing noise behind him gave him a moments warning .He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them .Like it hot scum ?roared Crabbe as he ran .But he seemed to have no control over what he had done .Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks which were crumbling to soot at their touch .Aguamenti Harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air .RUN !Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along Crabbe outstripped all of them now looking terrified Harry Ron and Hermione pelted along in his wake and the fire pursued them .It was not normal fire Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive sentient intent upon killing them .Now the fire was mutating forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts Flaming serpents chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths tossed high on clawed feet before being consumed by the inferno .Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle had vanished from view Harry Ron and Hermione stopped dead the fiery monsters were circling them drawing closer and closer claws and horns and tails lashed and the heat was solid as a wall around them .What can we do ?Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire .What can we do ?Here !Harry seized a pair of heavylooking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron who pulled Hermione onto it behind him .Harry swung his leg over the second broom and with hard kicks to the ground they soared up into the air missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them .The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room .Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy Crabbe or Goyle anywhere He swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them but there was nothing but fire What a terrible way to die .He had never wanted this .Harry lets get out lets get out !bellowed Ron though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke .And then Harry heard a thin piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion the thunder of devouring flame .Its too dangerous !Ron yelled but Harry wheeled in the air .His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke he raked the firestorm below seeking a sign of life a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood .And he saw them Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks and Harry dived .Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy s hand covered in sweat slid instantly out of Harrys IF WE DIE FOR THEM ILL KILL YOU HARRY !roared Rons voice and as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose rolling and pitching into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry .The door get to the door the door !screamed Malfoy in Harrys ear and Harry sped up following Ron Hermione and Goyle through the billowing black smoke hardly able to breathe and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration cups and shields a sparkling necklace and an old discolored tiara What are you doing what are you doing the doors that way screamed Malfoy but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived .The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him he soared upward and straight toward the place where he prayed the door stood open Ron Hermione and Goyle had vanished Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt .Then through the smoke Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond .Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown gasping coughing and retching .Harry rolled over and sat up The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle who was still unconscious .CCrabbe choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak .CCrabbe .Hes dead said Ron harshly .There was silence apart from panting and coughing .Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms .Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around The battle was still going on all around him .He could hear more screams than those of the retreating ghosts .Panic flared within him .Wheres Ginny ?he said sharply .She was here .She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement .Blimey dyou reckon itll still work after that fire ?asked Ron but he too got to his feet rubbing his chest and looking left and right .Shall we split up and look ?No said Hermione getting to her feet too .Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor neither of them had wands .Lets stick together .I say we go Harry whats that on your arm ?What ?Oh yeah He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up .It was still hot blackened with soot but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MANS GREATEST TREASURE .A bloodlike substance dark and tarry seemed to be leaking from the diadem .Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently then break apart in his hands and as it did so he thought he heard the faintest most distant scream of pain echoing not from the grounds or the castle but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers .It must have been Fiendfyre !whimpered Hermione her eyes on the broken pieces .Sorry ?Fiendfyre cursed fire its one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes but I would never ever have dared use it its so dangerous how did Crabbe know how to ?Mustve learned from the Carrows said Harry grimly .Shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really said Ron whose hair like Hermiones was singed and whose face was blackened .If he hadnt tried to kill us all Id be quite sorry he was dead .But dont you realize ?whispered Hermione .This means if we can just get the snake But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor .Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts .Fred and Percy had just backed into view both of them dueling masked and hooded men .Harry Ron and Hermione ran forward to help Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off fast Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair Hello Minister !bellowed Percy sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes apparently in awful discomfort .Did I mention Im resigning ?Youre joking Perce !shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells .Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin .Fred looked at Percy with glee .You actually are joking Perce .I dont think Ive heard you joke since you were The air exploded .They had been grouped together Harry Ron Hermione Fred and Percy the two Death Eaters at their feet one Stunned the other Transfigured and in that fragment of a moment when danger seemed temporarily at bay the world was rent apart .Harry felt himself flying through the air and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon and shield his head in his arms He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack .Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously .Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause and he stood up swaying more frightened than he had been that day more frightened perhaps than he had been in his life .And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart .Harry grabbed Hermione s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood .No no no !someone was shouting .No !Fred !No !And Percy was shaking his brother and Ron was kneeling beside them and Freds eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face .THE ELDER WAND The world had ended so why had the battle not ceased the castle fallen silent in horror and every combatant laid down their arms ?Harrys mind was in free fall spinning out of control unable to grasp the impossibility because Fred Weasley could not be dead the evidence of all his senses must be lying And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them from the darkness hitting the wall behind their heads .Get down !Harry shouted as more curses flew through the night He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor but Percy lay across Freds body shielding it from further harm and when Harry shouted Percy come on weve got to move !he shook his head .Percy !Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Rons face as he seized his elder brothers shoulders and pulled but Percy would not budge .Percy you cant do anything for him !Were going to Hermione screamed and Harry turning did not need to ask why .A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall One of Aragogs descendants had joined the fight .Ron and Harry shouted together their spells collided and the monster was blown backward its legs jerking horribly and vanished into the darkness .It brought friends !Harry called to the others glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building liberated from the Forbidden Forest into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated .Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them knocking the lead monster into its fellows so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight .Then more curses came soaring over Harrys head so close he felt the force of them blow his hair .Lets move NOW !Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron Harry stooped to seize Freds body under the armpits .Percy realizing what Harry was trying to do stopped clinging to the body and helped together crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds they hauled Fred out of the way .Here said Harry and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier .He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to and after making sure that the body was well hidden he took off after Ron and Hermione .Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the end of the corridor which was now full of dust and falling masonry glass long gone from the windows he saw many people running backward and forward whether friends or foes he could not tell .Rounding the corner Percy let out a bulllike roar ROOKWOOD !and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man who was pursuing a couple of students .Harry in here !Hermione screamed .She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry They seemed to be wrestling together and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron to stop him running after Percy .Listen to me LISTEN ROM I wanna help I wanna kill Death Eaters His face was contorted smeared with dust and smoke and he was shaking with rage and grief .Ron were the only ones who can end it !Please Ron we need the snake weve got to kill the snake !said Hermione .But Harry knew how Ron felt Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge he too wanted to fight to punish them the people who had killed Fred and he wanted to find the other Weasleys and above all make sure make quite sure that Ginny was not but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind We will fight !Hermione said .Well have to to reach the snake !But lets not lose sight now of what were supposed to be ddoing !Were the only ones who can end it !She was crying too and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as still keeping a tight hold on Ron she turned to Harry .You need to find out where Voldemort is because hell have the snake with him wont he ?Do it Harry look inside him !Why was it so easy ?Because his scar had been burning for hours yearning to show him Voldemorts thoughts ?He closed his eyes on her command and at once the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant as though he stood far far away from them .He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one .The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant .The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp .He was rolling his wand between his fingers watching it his thoughts on the room in the castle the secret room only he had ever found the room like the Chamber that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover .He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem .although Dumbledores puppet had come much farther than he had ever expected .too far .My Lord said a voice desperate and cracked .He turned There was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boys last escape .One of his eyes remained closed and puffy .My Lord .please .my son .If your son is dead Lucius it is not my fault .He did not come and join me like the rest of the Slytherins .Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter ?No never whispered Malfoy .You must hope not .Arent arent you afraid my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours ?asked Malfoy his voice shaking .Wouldnt it be .forgive me .more prudent to call off this battle enter the castle and seek him yyourself ?Do not pretend Lucius .You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son .And I do not need to seek Potter .Before the night is out Potter will have come to find me .Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers .It troubled him .and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged .Go and fetch Snape .Snape mmy Lord ?Snape .Now .I need him .There is a service I require from him .Go .Frightened stumbling a little through the gloom Lucius left the room .Voldemort continued to stand there twirling the wand between his fingers staring at it .It is the only way Nagini he whispered and he looked around and there was the great thick snake now suspended in midair twisting gracefully within the enchanted protected space he had made for her a starry transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank .With a gasp Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries the smashes and bangs of battle .Hes in the Shrieking Shack .The snakes with him its got some sort of magical protection around it .Hes just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape .Voldemorts sitting in the Shrieking Shack ?said Hermione outraged .Hes not hes not even fighting ?He doesnt think he needs to fight said Harry .He thinks Im going to go to him .But why ?He knows Im after Horcruxes hes keeping Nagini close beside him obviously Im going to have to go to him to get near the thing Right said Ron squaring his shoulders .So you cant go thats what he wants what hes expecting .You stay here and look after Hermione and Ill go and get it Harry cut across Ron .You two stay here Ill go under the Cloak and Ill be back as soon as I No said Hermione it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and Dont even think about it Ron snarled at her .Before Hermione could get farther than Ron Im just as capable the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open .POTTER !Two masked Death Eaters stood there but even before their wands were fully raised Hermione shouted Glisseo The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she Harry and Ron hurtled down it unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters Stunning Spells flew far over their heads .They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor hitting the opposite wall .Duro cried Hermione pointing her wand at the tapestry and there were two loud sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it .Get back !shouted Ron and he Harry and Hermione flattened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall .She appeared not to notice them Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek .As she turned the corner they heard her scream CHARGE !Harry you get the Cloak on said Hermione .Never mind us But he threw it over all three of them large though they were he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air the falling stone the shimmer of spells .They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers .The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement while Death Eaters both masked and unmasked dueled students and teachers .Dean had won himself a wand for he was facetoface with Dolohov Parvati with Travers .Harry Ron and Hermione raised their wands at once ready to strike but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses .Even as they stood braced looking for the opportunity to act there came a great Wheeeeeeeeeeee and looking up Harry saw Peeves zooming over them dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms .Argh !A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Rons head the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose .Someones invisible there !shouted a masked Death Eater pointing .Dean made the most of the Death Eaters momentary distraction knocking him out with a Stunning Spell Dolohov attempted to retaliate and Parvati shot a BodyBind Curse at him .LETS GO !Harry yelled and he Ron and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted heads down through the midst of the fighters slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall .Im Draco Malfoy Im Draco Im on your side !Draco was on the upper landing pleading with another masked Death Eater .Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed Malfoy looked around beaming for his savior and Ron punched him from under the Cloak .Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater his mouth bleeding utterly bemused .And thats the second time weve saved your life tonight you twofaced bastard !Ron yelled .There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked Yaxley close to the front doors in combat with Flitwick a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them .Students ran in every direction some carrying or dragging injured friends .Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater it missed but nearly hit Neville who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in .Harry Ron and Hermione sped down the marble staircase Glass shattered to their left and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere so that people slipped and staggered as they ran .Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen .NO !shrieked Hermione and with a deafening blast from her wand Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of Lavender Brown .He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet .Then with a bright white flash and a crack a crystal ball fell on top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move .I have more !shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters .More for any who want them !Here And with a movement like a tennis serve she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag waved her wand through the air and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window .At the same moment the heavy wooden front doors burst open and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the entrance hall .Screams of terror rent the air The fighters scattered Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters which shuddered and reared more terrifying than ever .How do we get out ?yelled Ron over all the screaming but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs brandishing his flowery pink umbrella .Dont hurt em dont hurt em !he yelled .HAGRID NO !Harry forgot everything else He sprinted out from under the Cloak running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall .HAGRID COME BACK !But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders and with a great scurrying a foul swarming movement they retreated under the onslaught of spells Hagrid buried in their midst .HAGRID !Harry heard someone calling his own name whether friend or foe he did not care He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds and the spiders were swarming away with their prey and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all .HAGRID !He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm but as he made to chase after them his way was impeded by a monumental foot which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder .He looked up A giant stood before him twenty feet high its head hidden in shadow nothing but its treelike hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors .With one brutal fluid movement it smashed a massive fist through an upper window and glass rained down upon Harry forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway .Oh my !shrieked Hermione as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above .DONT !Ron yelled grabbing Hermiones hand as she raised her wand .Stun him and hell crush half the castle HAGGER ?Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle only now did Harry realize that Grawp was indeed an undersized giant .The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar .The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin and Grawp s lopsided mouth fell open showing yellow halfbrick sized teeth and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions .RUN !Harry roared the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled and he seized Hermiones hand and tore down the steps into the grounds Ron bringing up the rear .Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again .The air around them had frozen Harrys breath caught and solidified in his chest .Shapes moved out in the darkness swirling figures of concentrated blackness moving in a great wave toward the castle their faces hooded and their breath rattling .Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted deadened because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night and Fred was gone and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead .Come on Harry !said Hermiones voice from a very long way away .Patronuses Harry come on !He raised his wand but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about he felt as though his soul had already half left his body .HARRY COME ON !screamed Hermione .A hundred dementors were advancing gliding toward them sucking their way closer to Harrys despair which was like a promise of a feast .He saw Rons silver terrier burst into the air flicker feebly and expire he saw Hermiones otter twist in midair and fade and his own wand trembled in his hand and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion the promise of nothing of no feeling .And then a silver hare a boar and a fox soared past Harry Ron and Hermiones heads The dementors fell back before the creatures approach .Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them their wands outstretched continuing to cast their Patronuses Luna Ernie and Seamus .Thats right said Luna encouragingly as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D .A .Thats right Harry .come on think of something happy .Something happy ?he said his voice cracked .Were all still here she whispered were still fighting .Come on now .There was a silver spark then a wavering light and then with the greatest effort it had ever cost him the stag burst from the end of Harrys wand .It cantered forward and now the dementors scattered in earnest and immediately the night was mild again but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears .Cant thank you enough said Ron shakily turning to Luna Ernie and Seamus you just saved With a roar and an earthquaking tremor another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest brandishing a club taller than any of them .RUN !Harry shouted again but the others needed no telling They all scattered and not a second too soon for next moment the creatures vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing .Harry looked round Ron and Hermione were following him but the other three had vanished back into the battle .Lets get out of range !yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness .The Whomping Willow said Harry go !Somehow he walled it all up in his mind crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid and his terror for all the people he loved scattered in and outside the castle must all wait because they had to run had to reach the snake and Voldemort because that was as Hermione said the only way to end it He sprinted half believing he could outdistance death itself ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life and it was he who saw the great tree first the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike slashing branches .Panting and gasping Harry slowed down skirting the Willows swiping branches peering through the darkness toward its thick trunk trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it .Ron and Hermione caught up Hermione so out of breath she could not speak .How howre we going to get in ?panted Ron .I can see the place if we just had Crookshanks again Crookshanks ?wheezed Hermione bent double clutching her chest .Are you a wizard or what ?Oh right yeah Ron looked around then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said Wingardium Leviosal The twig flew up from the ground spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willows ominously swaying branches .It jabbed at a place near the roots and at once the writhing tree became still .Perfect !panted Hermione .Wait .For one teetering second while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air Harry hesitated .Voldemort wanted him to do this wanted him to come .Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap ?But then the reality seemed to close upon him cruel and plain The only way forward was to kill the snake and the snake was where Voldemort was and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel .Harry were coming just get in there !said Ron pushing him forward .Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the trees roots .It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it .The tunnel was lowceilinged They had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously now there was nothing for it but to crawl .Harry went first his wand illuminated expecting at any moment to meet barriers but none came .They moved in silence Harrys gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist .At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead .Hermione tugged at his ankle .The Cloak !she whispered .Put the Cloak on !He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand .With difficulty he dragged it over himself murmured Nox extinguishing his wandlight and continued on his hands and knees as silently as possible all his senses straining expecting every second to be discovered to hear a cold clear voice see a flash of green light .And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate .Hardly daring to breathe Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall .The room beyond was dimly lit but he could see Nagini swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater safe in her enchanted starry sphere which floated unsupported in midair .He could see the edge of a table and a longfingered white hand toying with a wand .Then Snape spoke and Harrys heart lurched Snape was inches away from where he crouched hidden . .my Lord their resistance is crumbling and it is doing so without your help said Voldemort in his high clear voice .Skilled wizard though you are Severus I do not think you will make much difference now .We are almost there .almost .Let me find the boy .Let me bring you Potter .I know I can find him my Lord .Please .Snape strode past the gap and Harry drew back a little keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her but he could not think of anything .One failed attempt and he would give away his position .Voldemort stood up .Harry could see him now see the red eyes the flattened serpentine face the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness .I have a problem Severus said Voldemort softly .My Lord ?said Snape .Voldemort raised the Elder Wand holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductors baton .Why doesnt it work for me Severus ?In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled or was it Voldemorts sibilant sigh lingering on the air ?My my Lord ?said Snape blankly .I do not understand .You you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand .No said Voldemort .I have performed my usual magic .I am extraordinary but this wand .no .It has not revealed the wonders it has promised .I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago .Voldemorts tone was musing calm but Harrys scar had begun to throb and pulse Pain was building in his forehead and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort .No difference said Voldemort again .Snape did not speak .Harry could not see his face He wondered whether Snape sensed danger was trying to find the right words to reassure his master .Voldemort started to move around the room Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled speaking in that same measured voice while the pain and fury mounted in Harry .I have thought long and hard Severus .Do you know why I have called you back from the battle ?And for a moment Harry saw Snape s profile His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage .No my Lord but I beg you will let me return .Let me find Potter .You sound like Lucius .Neither of you understands Potter as I do .He does not need finding .Potter will come to me .I know his weakness you see his one great flaw .He will hate watching the others struck down around him knowing that it is for him that it happens .He will want to stop it at any cost .He will come .But my Lord he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear .Capture Potter .Kill his friends the more the better but do not kill him .But it is of you that I wished to speak Severus not Harry Potter .You have been very valuable to me .Very valuable .My Lord knows I seek only to serve him .But let me go and find the boy my Lord .Let me bring him to you .I know I can I have told you no !said Voldemort and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake and he felt Voldemorts impatience in his burning scar .My concern at the moment Severus is what will happen when I finally meet the boy !My Lord there can be no question surely ?but there is a question Severus .There is .Voldemort halted and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers staring at Snape .Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter ?I I cannot answer that my Lord .Cant you ?The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harrys head He forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain .He closed his eyes and suddenly he was Voldemort looking into Snapes pale face .My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it Severus except to kill Harry Potter .Twice it failed .Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores told me to take anothers wand .I did so but Luciuss wand shattered upon meeting Potters .I I have no explanation my Lord .Snape was not looking at Voldemort now .His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere .I sought a third wand Severus .The Elder Wand the Wand of Destiny the Deathstick .I took it from its previous master .I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore .And now Snape looked at Voldemort and Snapes face was like a death mask .It was marble white and so still that when he spoke it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes .My Lord let me go to the boy All this long night when I am on the brink of victory I have sat here said Voldemort his voice barely louder than a whisper wondering wondering why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner .and I think I have the answer .Snape did not speak .Perhaps you already know it ?You are a clever man after all Severus .You have been a good and faithful servant and I regret what must happen .My Lord The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly Severus because I am not its true master .The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner .You killed Albus Dumbledore .While you live Severus the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine .My Lord !Snape protested raising his wand .It cannot be any other way said Voldemort .I must master the wand Severus .Master the wand and I master Potter at last .And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand .It did nothing to Snape who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved But then Voldemorts intention became clear .The snakes cage was rolling through the air and before Snape could do anything more than yell it had encased him head and shoulders and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue .Kill .There was a terrible scream .Harry saw Snape s face losing the little color it had left it whitened as his black eyes widened as the snakes fangs pierced his neck as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor .I regret it said Voldemort coldly .He turned away there was no sadness in him no remorse .It was time to leave this shack and take charge with a wand that would now do his full bidding .He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake which drifted upward off Snape who fell sideways onto the floor blood gushing from the wounds in his neck .Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere .Back in the tunnel and his own mind Harry opened his eyes He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out .Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor .Harry !breathed Hermione behind him but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view .It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently .As quietly as he could he pulled himself up into the room .He did not know why he was doing it why he was approaching the dying man He did not know what he felt as he saw Snapes white face and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck .Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated whose widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak .Harry bent over him and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close .A terrible rasping gurgling noise issued from Snapes throat .Take .it .Take .it .Something more than blood was leaking from Snape .Silvery blue neither gas nor liquid it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes and Harry knew what it was but did not know what to do A flask conjured from thin air was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione .Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand .When the flask was full to the brim and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him his grip on Harrys robes slackened .Look .at .me .he whispered .The green eyes found the black but after a second something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish leaving them fixed blank and empty .The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor and Snape moved no more .THE PRINCES TALE Harry remained kneeling at Snapes side simply staring down at him until quite suddenly a high cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet the flask gripped tightly in his hands thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room .Voldemort s voice reverberated from the walls and floor and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them his breath on the back of their necks a deathblow away .You have fought said the high cold voice valiantly .Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery .Yet you have sustained heavy losses .If you continue to resist me you will all die one by one .I do not wish this to happen .Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste .Lord Voldemort is merciful .I command my forces to retreat immediately .You have one hour .Dispose of your dead with dignity .Treat your injured .I speak now Harry Potter directly to you .You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself .I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest .If at the end of that hour you have not come to me have not given yourself up then battle recommences .This time I shall enter the fray myself Harry Potter and I shall find you and I shall punish every last man woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me .One hour .Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically looking at Harry .Dont listen to him said Ron .Itll be all right said Hermione wildly .Lets lets get back to the castle if hes gone to the forest well need to think of a new plan She glanced at Snapes body then hurried back to the tunnel entrance .Ron followed her .Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak then looked down at Snape .He did not know what to feel except shock at the way Snape had been killed and the reason for which it had been done .They crawled back through the tunnel none of them talking and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could .You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest .One hour .Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle .It could only be an hour or so from dawn yet it was pitchblack .The three of them hurried toward the stone steps .A lone clog the size of a small boat lay abandoned in front of them .There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker .The castle was unnaturally silent .There were no flashes of light now no bangs or screams or shouts .The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood .Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor along with pieces of marble and splintered wood .Part of the banisters had been blown away .Where is everyone ?whispered Hermione .Ron led the way to the Great Hall .Harry stopped in the doorway .The House tables were gone and the room was crowded .The survivors stood in groups their arms around each others necks .The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers .Firenze was amongst the injured his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay unable to stand .The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall .Harry could not see Freds body because his family surrounded him .George was kneeling at his head Mrs Weasley was lying across Freds chest her body shaking Mr Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks .Without a word to Harry Ron and Hermione walked away .Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny whose face was swollen and blotchy and hug her .Ron joined Bill Fleur and Percy who flung an arm around Rons shoulders .As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred Remus and Tonks pale and still and peacefullooking apparently asleep beneath the dark enchanted ceiling .The Great Hall seemed to fly away become smaller shrink as Harry reeled backward from the doorway .He could not draw breath .He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies to see who else had died for him .He could not bear to join the Weasleys could not look into their eyes when if he had given himself up in the first place Fred might never have died .He turned away and ran up the marble staircase .Lupin Tonks .He yearned not to feel .He wished he could rip out his heart his innards everything that was screaming inside him .The castle was completely empty even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall .Harry ran without stopping clutching the crystal flask of Snapes last thoughts and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmasters office .Password ?Dumbledore !said Harry without thinking because it was he whom he yearned to see and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind .But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change .The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty .Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him all it seemed had flitted away charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on .Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledores deserted frame which hung directly behind the headmasters chair then turned his back on it .The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snapes memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge .To escape into someone elses head would be a blessed relief .Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts .The memories swirled silver white and strange and without hesitating with a feeling of reckless abandonment as though this would assuage his torturing grief Harry dived .He fell headlong into sunlight and his feet found warm ground .When he straightened up he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground .A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline .Two girls were swinging backward and forward and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes .His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate too short jeans a shabby overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man an odd smocklike shirt .Harry moved closer to the boy .Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old sallow small stringy .There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister .Lily dont do it !shrieked the elder of the two .But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air quite literally flown launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt she soared like a trapeze artist through the air staying up far too long landing far too lightly .Mummy told you not to !Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground making a crunching grinding sound then leapt up hands on hips .Mummy said you werent allowed Lily !But Im fine said Lily still giggling .Tuney look at this .Watch what I can do .Petunia glanced around .The playground was deserted apart from themselves and though the girls did not know it Snape .Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked .Petunia advanced evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval .Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view then held out her palm .The flower sat there opening and closing its petals like some bizarre manylipped oyster .Stop it !shrieked Petunia .Its not hurting you said Lily but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground .Its not right said Petunia but her eyes had followed the flowers flight to the ground and lingered upon it .How do you do it ?she added and there was definite longing in her voice .Its obvious isnt it ?Snape could no longer contain himself but had jumped out from behind the bushes .Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings but Lily though clearly startled remained where she was .Snape seemed to regret his appearance .A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily .Whats obvious ?asked Lily .Snape had an air of nervous excitement .With a glance at the distant Petunia now hovering beside the swings he lowered his voice and said I know what you are .What do you mean ?Youre .youre a witch whispered Snape .She looked affronted .Thats not a very nice thing to say to somebody !She turned nose in the air and marched off toward her sister .No !said Snape .He was highly colored now and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it .He flapped after the girls looking ludicrously batlike like his older self .The sisters considered him united in disapproval both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag .You are said Snape to Lily .You are a witch .Ive been watching you for a while .But theres nothing wrong with that .My mums one and Im a wizard .Petunias laugh was like cold water .Wizard !she shrieked her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance .I know who you are .Youre that Snape boy !They live down Spinners End by the river she told Lily and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation .Why have you been spying on us ?Havent been spying said Snape hot and uncomfortable and dirtyhaired in the bright sunlight .Wouldnt spy on you anyway he added spitefully youre a Muggle .Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word she could hardly mistake the tone .Lily come on were leaving !she said shrilly .Lily obeyed her sister at once glaring at Snape as she left .He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate and Harry the only one left to observe him recognized Snape s bitter disappointment and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while and that it had all gone wrong .The scene dissolved and before Harry knew it re formed around him .He was now in a small thicket of trees .He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks .The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade .Two children sat facing each other crosslegged on the ground .Snape had removed his coat now his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light . .and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school you get letters .But I have done magic outside school !Were all right .We havent got wands yet .They let you off when youre a kid and you cant help it .But once youre eleven he nodded importantly and they start training you then youve got to go careful .There was a little silence .Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it .Then she dropped the twig leaned in toward the boy and said It is real isnt it ?Its not a joke ?Petunia says youre lying to me .Petunia says there isnt a Hogwarts .It is real isnt it ?Its real for us said Snape .Not for her .But well get the letter you and me .Really ?whispered Lily .Definitely said Snape and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her brimful of confidence in his destiny .And will it really come by owl ?Lily whispered .Normally said Snape .But youre Muggleborn so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents .Does it make a difference being Muggleborn ?Snape hesitated .His black eyes eager in the greenish gloom moved over the pale face the dark red hair .No he said .It doesnt make any difference .Good said Lily relaxing It was clear that she had been worrying .Youve got loads of magic said Snape .I saw that .All the time I was watching you .His voice trailed away she was not listening but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead .He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground .How are things at your house ?Lily asked .A little crease appeared between his eyes .Fine he said .Theyre not arguing anymore ?Oh yes theyre arguing said Snape .He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart apparently unaware of what he was doing .But it wont be that long and Ill be gone .Doesnt your dad like magic ?He doesnt like anything much said Snape .Severus ?A little smile twisted Snape s mouth when she said his name .Yeah ?Tell me about the dementors again .What dyou want to know about them for ?If I use magic outside school They wouldnt give you to the dementors for that !Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff .They guard the wizard prison Azkaban .Youre not going to end up in Azkaban youre too He turned red again and shredded more leaves .Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn Petunia hiding behind a tree had lost her footing .Tuney !said Lily surprise and welcome in her voice but Snape had jumped to his feet .Whos spying now ?he shouted .What dyou want ?Petunia was breathless alarmed at being caught .Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say .What is that youre wearing anyway ?she said pointing at Snapes chest .Your mums blouse ?There was a crack A branch over Petunias head had fallen .Lily screamed The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder and she staggered backward and burst into tears .Tuney !But Petunia was running away .Lily rounded on Snape .Did you make that happen ?No .He looked both defiant and scared .You did !She was backing away from him .You did .You hurt her !No no I didnt !But the lie did not convince Lily After one last burning look she ran from the little thicket off after her sister and Snape looked miserable and confused .And the scene reformed .Harry looked around He was on platform nine and threequarters and Snape stood beside him slightly hunched next to a thin sallowfaced sourlooking woman who greatly resembled him .Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away .The two girls stood a little apart from their parents .Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister Harry moved closer to listen . .Im sorry Tuney Im sorry !Listen She caught her sisters hand and held tight to it even though Petunia tried to pull it away .Maybe once Im there no listen Tuney !Maybe once Im there Ill be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind !I dont want to go !said Petunia and she dragged her hand back out of her sisters grasp .You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a a Her pale eyes roved over the platform over the cats mewling in their owners arms over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages over the students some already in their long black robes loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart .you think I want to be a a freak ?Lilys eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away .Im not a freak said Lily .Thats a horrible thing to say .Thats where youre going said Petunia with relish .A special school for freaks .You and that Snape boy .weirdos thats what you two are .Its good youre being separated from normal people .Its for our safety .Lily glanced toward her parents who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment drinking in the scene .Then she looked back at her sister and her voice was low and fierce .You didnt think it was such a freaks school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you .Petunia turned scarlet .Beg ?I didnt beg !I saw his reply .It was very kind .You shouldnt have read whispered Petunia that was my private how could you ?Lily gave herself away by halfglancing toward where Snape stood nearby .Petunia gasped .That boy found it !You and that boy have been sneaking in my room !No not sneaking Now Lily was on the defensive .Severus saw the envelope and he couldnt believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts thats all !He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere !said Petunia now as pale as she had been flushed .Freak .she spat at her sister and she flounced off to where her parents stood .The scene dissolved again .Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside .He had already changed into his school robes had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes .At last he stopped outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking .Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily her face pressed against the windowpane .Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily .She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window .She had been crying .I dont want to talk to you she said in a constricted voice .Why not ?Tuney hhates me .Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore .So what ?She threw him a look of deep dislike .So shes my sister !Shes only a He caught himself quickly Lily too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed did not hear him .But were going !he said unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice .This is it !Were off to Hogwarts !She nodded mopping her eyes but in spite of herself she half smiled .Youd better be in Slytherin said Snape encouraged that she had brightened a little .Slytherin ?One of the boys sharing the compartment who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point looked around at the word and Harry whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window saw his father slight blackhaired like Snape but with that indefinable air of having been wellcaredfor even adored that Snape so conspicuously lacked .Who wants to be in Slytherin ?I think Id leave wouldnt you ?James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him and with a jolt Harry realized that it was Sirius .Sirius did not smile .My whole family have been in Slytherin he said .Blimey said James and I thought you seemed all right !Sirius grinned .Maybe Ill break the tradition .Where are you heading if youve got the choice ?James lifted an invisible sword . ‘Gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart !Like my dad .Snape made a small disparaging noise .James turned on him .Got a problem with that ?No said Snape though his slight sneer said otherwise .If youd rather be brawny than brainy Where re you hoping to go seeing as youre neither ?interjected Sirius .James roared with laughter .Lily sat up rather flushed and looked from James to Sirius in dislike .Come on Severus lets find another compartment .Oooooo .James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice James tried to trip Snape as he passed .See ya Snivellus !a voice called as the compartment door slammed .And the scene dissolved once more .Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables lined with rapt faces .Then Professor McGonagall said Evans Lily !He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool .Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair the hat cried Gryffindoii Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan .Lily took off the hat handed it back to Professor McGonagall then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors but as she went she glanced back at Snape and there was a sad little smile on her face .Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her .She took one look at him seemed to recognize him from the train folded her arms and firmly turned her back on him .The roll call continued .Harry watched Lupin Pettigrew and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table .At last when only a dozen students remained to be sorted Professor McGonagall called Snape .Harry walked with him to the stool watched him place the hat upon his head .Slytherinl cried the Sorting Hat .And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall away from Lily to where the Slytherins were cheering him to where Lucius Malfoy a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him .And the scene changed .Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard evidently arguing .Harry hurried to catch up with them to listen in .As he reached them he realized how much taller they both were A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting . .thought we were supposed to be friends ?Snape was saying .Best friends ?We are Sev but I dont like some of the people youre hanging round with !Im sorry but I detest Avery and Mulciber !Mulciber What do you see in him Sev hes creepy !Dyou know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day ?Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it looking up into the thin sallow face .That was nothing said Snape .It was a laugh thats all It was Dark Magic and if you think thats funny What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to ?demanded Snape .His color rose again as he said it unable it seemed to hold in his resentment .Whats Potter got to do with anything ?said Lily .They sneak out at night .Theres something weird about that Lupin .Where does he keep going ?Hes ill said Lily .They say hes ill Every month at the full moon ?said Snape .I know your theory said Lily and she sounded cold .Why are you so obsessed with them anyway ?Why do you care what theyre doing at night ?Im just trying to show you theyre not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are .The intensity of his gaze made her blush .They dont use Dark Magic though .She dropped her voice .And youre being really ungrateful .I heard what happened the other night .You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow and James Potter saved you from whatevers down there Snapes whole face contorted and he spluttered Saved ?Saved ?You think he was playing the hero ?He was saving his neck and his friends too !Youre not going to I wont let you Let me ?Let me ?Lilys bright green eyes were slits .Snape backtracked at once .I didnt mean I just dont want to see you made a fool of He fancies you James Potter fancies you !The words seemed wrenched from him against his will .And hes not .everyone thinks .big Quidditch hero Snapes bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent and Lilys eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead .I know James Potters an arrogant toerag she said cutting across Snape .I dont need you to tell me that .But Mulcibers and Averys idea of humor is just evil .Evil Sev .I dont understand how you can be friends with them .Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery .The moment she had insulted James Potter his whole body had relaxed and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snapes step .And the scene dissolved .Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O .W .L .in Defense Against the Dark Arts watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James Sirius Lupin and Pettigrew sat together .But Harry kept his distance this time because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him he knew what had been done and said and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again .He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snapes defense .Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury the unforgivable word MudbloocL .The scene changed .Im sorry .Im not interested .Im sorry !Save your breath .It was nighttime .Lily who was wearing a dressing gown stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower .I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here .I was .I would have done .I never meant to call you Mudblood it just Slipped out ?There was no pity in Lilys voice .Its too late .Ive made excuses for you for years .None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you .You and your precious little Death Eater friends you see you dont even deny it !You dont even deny thats what youre all aiming to be !You cant wait to join You Know Who can you ?He opened his mouth but closed it without speaking .I cant pretend anymore .Youve chosen your way Ive chosen mine .No listen I didnt mean to call me Mudblood ?But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood Severus .Why should I be any different ?He struggled on the verge of speech but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole .The corridor dissolved and the scene took a little longer to reform Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop forlorn and cold in the darkness the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees .The adult Snape was panting turning on the spot his wand gripped tightly in his hand waiting for something or for someone .His fear infected Harry too even though he knew that he could not be harmed and he looked over his shoulder wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for Then a blinding jagged jet of white light flew through the air Harry thought of lightning but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand .Dont kill me !That was not my intention .Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches .He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand .Well Severus ?What message does Lord Voldemort have for me ?No no message Im here on my own account !Snape was wringing his hands He looked a little mad with his straggling black hair flying around him .I I come with a warning no a request please Dumbledore flicked his wand .Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other .What request could a Death Eater make of me ?The the prophecy .the prediction .Trelawney Ah yes said Dumbledore .How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort ?Everything everything I heard !said Snape .That is why it is for that reason he thinks it means Lily Evans !The prophecy did not refer to a woman said Dumbledore .It spoke of a boy born at the end of July You know what I mean !He thinks it means her son he is going to hunt her down kill them all If she means so much to you said Dumbledore surely Lord Voldemort will spare her ?Could you not ask for mercy for the mother in exchange for the son ?I have I have asked him You disgust me said Dumbledore and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice .Snape seemed to shrink a little .You do not care then about the deaths of her husband and child ?They can die as long as you have what you want ?Snape said nothing but merely looked up at Dumbledore .Hide them all then he croaked .Keep her them safe .Please .And what will you give me in return Severus ?In in return ?Snape gaped at Dumbledore and Harry expected him to protest but after a long moment he said Anything .The hilltop faded and Harry stood in Dumbledores office and something was making a terrible sound like a wounded animal .Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him looking grim .After a moment or two Snape raised his face and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop .I thought .you were going .to keep her .safe .She and James put their faith in the wrong person said Dumbledore .Rather like you Severus .Werent you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her ?Snapes breathing was shallow .Her boy survives said Dumbledore .With a tiny jerk of the head Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly .Her son lives .He has her eyes precisely her eyes .You remember the shape and color of Lily Evanss eyes I am sure ?DONT !bellowed Snape .Gone .dead .Is this remorse Severus ?I wish .I wish were dead .And what use would that be to anyone ?said Dumbledore coldly .If you loved Lily Evans if you truly loved her then your way forward is clear .Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain and Dumbledore s words appeared to take a long time to reach him .What what do you mean ?You know how and why she died .Make sure it was not in vain .Help me protect Lilys son .He does not need protection .The Dark Lord has gone The Dark Lord will return and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does .There was a long pause and slowly Snape regained control of himself mastered his own breathing .At last he said Very well .Very well .But never never tell Dumbledore !This must be between us !Swear it !I cannot bear .especially Potters son .I want your word !My word Severus that I shall never reveal the best of you ?Dumbledore sighed looking down into Snapes ferocious anguished face .If you insist .The office dissolved but reformed instantly .Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore .mediocre arrogant as his father a determined rulebreaker delighted to find himself famous attentionseeking and impertinent You see what you expect to see Severus said Dumbledore without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today .Other teachers report that the boy is modest likable and reasonably talented .Personally I find him an engaging child .Dumbledore turned a page and said without looking up Keep an eye on Quirrell wont you ?A whirl of color and now everything darkened and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed .Well ?murmured Dumbledore .Karkaroffs Mark is becoming darker too .He is panicking he fears retribution you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell .Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore s crooked nosed profile .Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns .Does he ?said Dumbledore softly as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds .And are you tempted to join him ?No said Snape his black eyes on Fleurs and Rogers retreating figures .I am not such a coward .No agreed Dumbledore .You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff .You know I sometimes think we Sort too soon .He walked away leaving Snape looking stricken .And now Harry stood in the headmasters office yet again .It was nighttime and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk apparently semiconscious .His right hand dangled over the side blackened and burned .Snape was muttering incantations pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore s throat .After a moment or two Dumbledore s eyelids fluttered and opened .Why said Snape without preamble why did you put on that ring ?It carries a curse surely you realized that .Why even touch it ?Marvolo Gaunts ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore .It was cracked the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it .Dumbledore grimaced .I .was a fool .Sorely tempted .Tempted by what ?Dumbledore did not answer .It is a miracle you managed to return here !Snape sounded furious .That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power to contain it is all we can hope for I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being Dumbledore raised his blackened useless hand and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio .You have done very well Severus .How long do you think I have ?Dumbledore s tone was conversational he might have been asking for a weather forecast .Snape hesitated and then said I cannot tell .Maybe a year .There is no halting such a spell forever .It will spread eventually it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time .Dumbledore smiled .The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him .I am fortunate extremely fortunate that I have you Severus .If you had only summoned me a little earlier I might have been able to do more buy you more time !said Snape furiously .He looked down at the broken ring and the sword .Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse ?Something like that .I was delirious no doubt .said Dumbledore .With an effort he straightened himself in his chair .Well really this makes matters much more straightforward .Snape looked utterly perplexed .Dumbledore smiled .I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me .His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me .Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied across the desk from Dumbledore .Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore s cursed hand but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further .Scowling Snape said The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed .This is merely punishment for Luciuss recent failures .Slow torture for Dracos parents while they watch him fail and pay the price .In short the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have said Dumbledore .Now I should have thought the natural successor to the job once Draco fails is yourself ?There was a short pause .That I think is the Dark Lords plan .Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts ?He believes the school will soon be in his grasp yes .And if it does fall into his grasp said Dumbledore almost it seemed as an aside I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts ?Snape gave a stiff nod .Good .Now then .Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to .A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself .Offer him help and guidance he ought to accept he likes you much less since his father has lost favor .Draco blames me he thinks I have usurped Luciuss position .All the same try .I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy .Ultimately of course there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemorts wrath .Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked Are you intending to let him kill you ?Certainly not .You must kill me .There was a long silence broken only by an odd clicking noise .Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone .Would you like me to do it now ?asked Snape his voice heavy with irony .Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph ?Oh not quite yet said Dumbledore smiling .I daresay the moment will present itself in due course .Given what has happened tonight he indicated his withered hand we can be sure that it will happen within a year .If you dont mind dying said Snape roughly why not let Draco do it ?That boys soul is not yet so damaged said Dumbledore .I would not have it ripped apart on my account .And my soul Dumbledore ?Mine ?You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation said Dumbledore .I ask this one great favor of you Severus because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this years league .I confess I should prefer a quick painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if for instance Greyback is involved I hear Voldemort has recruited him ?Or dear Bellatrix who likes to play with her food before she eats it .His tone was light but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry as though the soul they discussed was visible to him .At last Snape gave another curt nod .Dumbledore seemed satisfied .Thank you Severus .The office disappeared and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight .What are you doing with Potter all these evenings you are closeted together ?Snape asked abruptly .Dumbledore looked weary .Why ?You arent trying to give him more detentions Severus ?The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out .He is his father over again In looks perhaps but his deepest nature is much more like his mothers .I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him information I must give him before it is too late .Information repeated Snape .You trust him .you do not trust me .It is not a question of trust .I have as we both know limited time .It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do .And why may I not have the same information ?I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort .Which I do on your orders !And you do it extremely well .Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself Severus .To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you .Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency whose magic is mediocre and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lords mind !Voldemort fears that connection said Dumbledore .Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harrys mind means to him .It was pain such as he has never experienced .He will not try to possess Harry again I am sure of it .Not in that way .I dont understand .Lord Voldemorts soul maimed as it is cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harrys .Like a tongue on frozen steel like flesh in flame Souls ?We were talking of minds !In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort to speak of one is to speak of the other .Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone .They were close by the Forbidden Forest now but there was no sign of anyone near them .After you have killed me Severus You refuse to tell me everything yet you expect that small service of me !snarled Snape and real anger flared in the thin face now .You take a great deal for granted Dumbledore !Perhaps I have changed my mind !You gave me your word Severus .And while we are talking about services you owe me I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend ?Snape looked angry mutinous .Dumbledore sighed .Come to my office tonight Severus at eleven and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you .They were back in Dumbledore s office the windows dark and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still as Dumbledore walked around him talking .Harry must not know not until the last moment not until it is necessary otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done ?But what must he do ?That is between Harry and me .Now listen closely Severus .There will come a time after my death do not argue do not interrupt !There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake .For Nagini ?Snape looked astonished .Precisely .If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection then I think it will be safe to tell Harry .Tell him what ?Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes .Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort and a fragment of Voldemorts soul was blasted apart from the whole and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building .Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes and a connection with Lord Voldemorts mind that he has never understood .And while that fragment of soul unmissed by Voldemort remains attached to and protected by Harry Lord Voldemort cannot die .Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel they were so far away from him their voices echoing strangely in his ears .So the boy .the boy must die ?asked Snape quite calmly .And Voldemort himself must do it Severus .That is essential .Another long silence .Then Snape said I thought .all these years .that we were protecting him for her .For Lily .We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him to raise him to let him try his strength said Dumbledore his eyes still tight shut .Meanwhile the connection between them grows ever stronger a parasitic growth Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself .If I know him he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death it will truly mean the end of Voldemort .Dumbledore opened his eyes .Snape looked horrified .You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment ?Dont be shocked Severus .How many men and women have you watched die ?Lately only those whom I could not save said Snape .He stood up .You have used me .Meaning ?I have spied for you and lied for you put myself in mortal danger for you .Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potters son safe .Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter But this is touching Severus said Dumbledore seriously .Have you grown to care for the boy after all ?For him ?shouted Snape .Expecto Patronuml From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe She landed on the office floor bounded once across the office and soared out of the window .Dumbledore watched her fly away and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape and his eyes were full of tears .After all this time ?Always said Snape .And the scene shifted .Now Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk .You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harrys departure from his aunt and uncles said Dumbledore .Not to do so will raise suspicion when Voldemort believes you so well informed .However you must plant the idea of decoys that I think ought to ensure Harrys safety .Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher .And Severus if you are forced to take part in the chase be sure to act your part convincingly .I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemorts good books as long as possible or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows .Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern Mundungus s face looking curiously blank Snape frowning in concentration .You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix Snape murmured that they use decoys .Polyjuice Potion .Identical Potters .It is the only thing that might work .You will forget that I have suggested this .You will present it as your own idea .You understand ?I understand murmured Mundungus his eyes unfocused .Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George . .A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand pointing it directly at Lupins back Sectumsemprcd shouted Snape .But the spell intended for the Death Eaters wand hand missed and hit George instead And next Snape was kneeling in Siriuss old bedroom .Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily .The second page carried only a few words could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald .I think her minds going personally !Lots of love Lily Snape took the page bearing Lilys signature and her love and tucked it inside his robes .Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor under the chest of drawers .And now Snape stood again in the headmasters study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait .Headmaster !They are camping in the Forest of Dean !The Mudblood Do not use that word !the Granger girl then mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her !Good .Very good !cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmasters chair .Now Severus the sword !Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor and he must not know that you give it !If Voldemort should read Harrys mind and see you acting for him I know said Snape curtly .He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side .It swung forward revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor .And you still arent going to tell me why its so important to give Potter the sword ?said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes .No I dont think so said Dumbledores portrait .He will know what to do with it .And Severus be very careful they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasleys mishap Snape turned at the door .Dont worry Dumbledore he said coolly .I have a plan .And Snape left the room .Harry rose up out of the Pensieve and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room Snape might just have closed the door .THE FOREST AGAIN Finally the truth .Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive .His job was to walk calmly into Deaths welcoming arms .Along the way he was to dispose of Voldemorts remaining links to life so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemorts path and did not raise a wand to defend himself the end would be clean and the job that ought to have been done in Godrics Hollow would be finished Neither would live neither could survive .He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest .How strange that in his dread of death it pumped all the harder valiantly keeping him alive .But it would have to stop and soon .Its beats were numbered .How many would there be time for as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time out into the grounds and into the forest ?Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor with that funeral drum pounding inside him .Would it hurt to die ?All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped he had never really thought of the thing itself His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death .Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape to outrun Voldemort .It was over he knew it and all that was left was the thing itself dying .If he could only have died on that summers night when he had left number four Privet Drive for the last time when the noble phoenixfeather wand had saved him !If he could only have died like Hedwig so quickly he would not have known it had happened !Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved .He envied even his parents deaths now .This coldblooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery .He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them although no one could see him the portraits on the walls were all empty .Slowly very slowly he sat up and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before .Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was brain and nerve and bounding heart ?It would all be gone .or at least he would be gone from it .His breath came slow and deep and his mouth and throat were completely dry but so were his eyes .Dumbledores betrayal was almost nothing .Of course there had been a bigger plan Harry had simply been too foolish to see it he realized that now .He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive .Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes .Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort but himself to life !How neat how elegant not to waste any more lives but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter and whose death would not be a calamity but another blow against Voldemort .And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out that he would keep going to the end even though it was his end because he had taken trouble to get to know him hadnt he ?Dumbledore knew as Voldemort knew that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it .The images of Fred Lupin and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his minds eye and for a moment he could hardly breathe Death was impatient .But Dumbledore had overestimated him .He had failed The snake survived .One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth even after Harry had been killed .True that would mean an easier job for somebody .He wondered who would do it .Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done of course .That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others .so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early they could carry on .Like rain on a cold window these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth which was that he must die .I must die .It must end .Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away in a far off country he felt as though he had parted from them long ago .There would be no goodbyes and no explanations he was determined of that .This was a journey they could not take together and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time .He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday .Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed .He stood up .His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird .Perhaps it knew it had little time left perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetimes beats before the end .He did not look back as he closed the office door .The castle was empty .He felt ghostly striding through it alone as if he had already died .The portrait people were still missing from their frames the whole place was eerily still as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed .Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall .Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed to be seen to be stopped but the Cloak was as ever impenetrable perfect and he reached the front doors easily .Then Neville nearly walked into him .He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds .Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach Colin Creevey though underage must have sneaked back just as Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle had done .He was tiny in death .You know what ?I can manage him alone Neville said Oliver Wood and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a firemans lift and carried him into the Great Hall .Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand .He looked like an old man .Then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies .Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall .People were moving around trying to comfort each other drinking kneeling beside the dead but he could not see any of the people he loved no hint of Hermione Ron Ginny or any of the other Weasleys no Luna .He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them but then would he ever have the strength to stop looking ?It was better like this .He moved down the steps and out into the darkness .It was nearly four in the morning and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath waiting to see whether he could do what he must .Harry moved toward Neville who was bending over another body .Neville .Blimey Harry you nearly gave me heart failure !Harry had pulled off the Cloak The idea had come to him out of nowhere born out of a desire to make absolutely sure .Where are you going alone ?Neville asked suspiciously .Its all part of the plan said Harry .Theres something Ive got to do .Listen Neville Harry !Neville looked suddenly scared .Harry youre not thinking of handing yourself over ?No Harry lied easily .Course not .this is something else .But I might be out of sight for a while .You know Voldemorts snake Neville ?Hes got a huge snake .Calls it Nagini .Ive heard yeah .What about it ?Its got to be killed .Ron and Hermione know that but just in case they The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment made it impossible to keep talking .But he pulled himself together again This was crucial he must be like Dumbledore keep a cool head make sure there were backups others to carry on .Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes now Neville would take Harrys place There would still be three in the secret .Just in case theyre busy and you get the chance Kill the snake ?Kill the snake Harry repeated .All right Harry .Youre okay are you ?Im fine .Thanks Neville .But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on .Were all going to keep fighting Harry .You know that ?Yeah I The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence he could not go on .Neville did not seem to find it strange .He patted Harry on the shoulder released him and walked away to look for more bodies .Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on .Someone else was moving not far away stooping over another prone figure on the ground .He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny .He stopped in his tracks .She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother .Its all right Ginny was saying .Its okay .Were going to get you inside .But I want to go home whispered the girl .I dont want to fight anymore !I know said Ginny and her voice broke .Its going to be all right .Ripples of cold undulated over Harrys skin .He wanted to shout out to the night he wanted Ginny to know that he was there he wanted her to know where he was going .He wanted to be stopped to be dragged back to be sent back home .But he was home .Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known .He and Voldemort and Snape the abandoned boys had all found home here .Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now holding her hand .With a huge effort Harry forced himself on .He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby but he did not speak and he did not look back .Hagrids hut loomed out of the darkness .There were no lights no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door his bark booming in welcome .All those visits to Hagrid and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire and rock cakes and giant grubs and his great bearded face and Ron vomiting slugs and Hermione helping him save Norbert .He moved on and now he reached the edge of the forest and he stopped .A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees he could feel their chill and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it .He had no strength left for a Patronus .He could no longer control his own trembling .It was not after all so easy to die .Every second he breathed the smell of the grass the cool air on his face was so precious To think that people had years and years time to waste so much time it dragged and he was clinging to each second .At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on and knew that he must .The long game was ended the Snitch had been caught it was time to leave the air .The Snitch .His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out .I open at the close .Breathing fast and hard he stared down at it .Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible it seemed to have sped up and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought .This was the close .This was the moment .He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered I am about to die .The metal shell broke open .He lowered his shaking hand raised Dracos wand beneath the Cloak and murmured Lumos .The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch .The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand .The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible .And again Harry understood without having to think .It did not matter about bringing them back for he was about to join them .He was not really fetching them They were fetching him .He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times .He knew it had happened because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy twig strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest .He opened his eyes and looked around .They were neither ghost nor truly flesh he could see that .They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago and he had been memory made nearly solid .Less substantial than living bodies but much more than ghosts they moved toward him and on each face there was the same loving smile .James was exactly the same height as Harry .He was wearing the clothes in which he had died and his hair was untidy and ruffled and his glasses were a little lopsided like Mr Weasleys .Sirius was tall and handsome and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life .He loped with an easy grace his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face .Lupin was younger too and much less shabby and his hair was thicker and darker .He looked happy to be back in this familiar place scene of so many adolescent wanderings .Lilys smile was widest of all .She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him and her green eyes so like his searched his face hungrily as though she would never be able to look at him enough .Youve been so brave .He could not speak .His eyes feasted on her and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever and that would be enough .You are nearly there said James .Very close .We are .so proud of you .Does it hurt ?The childish question had fallen from Harrys lips before he could stop it .Dying ?Not at all said Sirius .Quicker and easier than falling asleep .And he will want it to be quick .He wants it over said Lupin .I didnt want you to die Harry said .These words came without his volition .Any of you .Im sorry He addressed Lupin more than any of them beseeching him .right after youd had your son .Remus Im sorry I am sorry too said Lupin .Sorry I will never know him .but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand .I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life .A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harrys brow .He knew that they would not tell him to go that it would have to be his decision .Youll stay with me ?Until the very end said James .They wont be able to see you ?asked Harry .We are part of you said Sirius .Invisible to anyone else .Harry looked at his mother .Stay close to me he said quietly .And he set off .The dementors chill did not overcome him he passed through it with his companions and they acted like Patronuses to him and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together their branches tangled their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot .Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness traveling deeper and deeper into the forest with no idea where exactly Voldemort was but sure that he would find him .Beside him making scarcely a sound walked James Sirius Lupin and Lily and their presence was his courage and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other .His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now his limbs working without conscious instruction as if he were passenger not driver in the body he was about to leave .The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle Ron Hermione Ginny and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life toward Voldemort .A thud and a whisper Some other living creature had stirred close by .Harry stopped under the Cloak peering around listening and his mother and father Lupin and Sirius stopped too .Someone there came a rough whisper close at hand .Hes got an Invisibility Cloak .Could it be ?Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree Their wands flared and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness directly at the place Harry his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood .Apparently they could not see anything .Definitely heard something said Yaxley .Animal dyou reckon ?That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here said Dolohov glancing over his shoulder .Yaxley looked down at his watch .Times nearly up .Potters had his hour .Hes not coming .And he was sure hed come !He wont be happy .Better go back said Yaxley .Find out what the plan is now .He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest .Harry followed them knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go .He glanced sideways and his mother smiled at him and his father nodded encouragement .They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived .The remnants of his vast web were there still but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters to fight for their cause .A fire burned in the middle of the clearing and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent watchful Death Eaters .Some of them were still masked and hooded others showed their faces .Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group casting massive shadows over the scene their faces cruel roughhewn like rock .Harry saw Fenrir skulking chewing his long nails the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip .He saw Lucius Malfoy who looked defeated and terrified and Narcissa whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension .Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort who stood with his head bowed and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him .He might have been praying or else counting silently in his mind and Harry standing still on the edge of the scene thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hideand seek .Behind his head still swirling and coiling the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering charmed cage like a monstrous halo .When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle Voldemort looked up .No sign of him my Lord said Dolohov .Voldemort s expression did not change .The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight .Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers .My Lord Bellatrix had spoken She sat closest to Voldemort disheveled her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed .Voldemort raised his hand to silence her and she did not speak another word but eyed him in worshipful fascination .I thought he would come said Voldemort in his high clear voice his eyes on the leaping flames .I expected him to come .Nobody spoke .They seemed as scared as Harry whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside .His hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes with his wand .He did not want to be tempted to fight .I was it seems .mistaken said Voldemort .You werent .Harry said it as loudly as he could with all the force he could muster He did not want to sound afraid .The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents Sirius and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight .At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort .It was just the two of them .The illusion was gone as soon as it had come .The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together and there were many cries gasps even laughter .Voldemort had frozen where he stood but his red eyes had found Harry and he stared as Harry moved toward him with nothing but the fire between them .Then a voice yelled HARRY !NO !He turned Hagrid was bound and trussed tied to a tree nearby .His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled desperate .NO !NO !HARRY WHATRE YEH ?QUIET !shouted Rowle and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was silenced .Bellatrix who had leapt to her feet was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry her breast heaving .The only things that moved were the flames and the snake coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemorts head .Harry could feel his wand against his chest but he made no attempt to draw it .He knew that the snake was too well protected knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini fifty curses would hit him first .And still Voldemort and Harry looked at each other and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side considering the boy standing before him and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth .Harry Potter he said very softly .His voice might have been part of the spitting fire .The Boy Who Lived .None of the Death Eaters moved .They were waiting Everything was waiting .Hagrid was struggling and Bellatrix was panting and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny and her blazing look and the feel of her lips on his Voldemort had raised his wand .His head was still tilted to one side like a curious child wondering what would happen if he proceeded .Harry looked back into the red eyes and wanted it to happen now quickly while he could still stand before he lost control before he betrayed fear He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light and everything was gone .KINGS CROSS He lay facedown listening to the silence .He was perfectly alone .Nobody was watching .Nobody else was there .He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself .A long time later or maybe no time at all it came to him that he must exist must be more than disembodied thought because he was lying definitely lying on some surface .Therefore he had a sense of touch and the thing against which he lay existed too .Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion Harry became conscious that he was naked .Convinced as he was of his total solitude this did not concern him but it did intrigue him slightly .He wondered whether as he could feel he would be able to see .In opening them he discovered that he had eyes .He lay in a bright mist though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before .His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings .The floor on which he lay seemed to be white neither warm nor cold but simply there a flat blank something on which to be .He sat up .His body appeared unscathed .He touched his face .He was not wearing glasses anymore .Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him the small soft thumpings of something that flapped flailed and struggled .It was a pitiful noise yet also slightly indecent .He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive shameful .For the first time he wished he were clothed .Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away .He took them and pulled them on They were soft clean and warm .It was extraordinary how they had appeared just like that the moment he had wanted them .He stood up looking around .Was he in some great Room of Requirement ?The longer he looked the more there was to see .A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight .Perhaps it was a palace .All was hushed and still except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist .Harry turned slowly on the spot and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes .A wideopen space bright and clean a hall larger by far than the Great Hall with that clear domed glass ceiling .It was quite empty .He was the only person there except for He recoiled .He had spotted the thing that was making the noises .It had the form of a small naked child curled on the ground its skin raw and rough flayedlooking and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left unwanted stuffed out of sight struggling for breath .He was afraid of it .Small and fragile and wounded though it was he did not want to approach it .Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer ready to jump back at any moment .Soon he stood near enough to touch it yet he could not bring himself to do it .He felt like a coward .He ought to comfort it but it repulsed him .You cannot help .He spun around .Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him sprightly and upright wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue .Harry .He spread his arms wide and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged .You wonderful boy .You brave brave man .Let us walk .Stunned Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed set some distance away under that high sparkling ceiling .Dumbledore sat down in one of them and Harry fell into the other staring at his old headmasters face .Dumbledore s long silver hair and beard the piercingly blue eyes behind halfmoon spectacles the crooked nose Everything was as he had remembered it .And yet .But youre dead said Harry .Oh yes said Dumbledore matteroffactly .Then .Im dead too ?Ah said Dumbledore smiling still more broadly .That is the question isnt it ?On the whole dear boy I think not .They looked at each other the old man still beaming .Not ?repeated Harry .Not said Dumbledore .But .Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar .It did not seem to be there .But I should have died I didnt defend myself !I meant to let him kill me !And that said Dumbledore will I think have made all the difference .Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light like fire Harry had never seen the man so utterly so palpably content .Explain said Harry .But you already know said Dumbledore .He twiddled his thumbs together .I let him kill me said Harry .Didnt I ?You did said Dumbledore nodding .Go on !So the part of his soul that was in me .Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically urging Harry onward a broad smile of encouragement on his face . .has it gone ?Oh yes !said Dumbledore .Yes he destroyed it .Your soul is whole and completely your own Harry .But then .Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small maimed creature trembled under the chair .What is that Professor ?Something that is beyond either of our help said Dumbledore .But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse Harry started again and nobody died for me this time how can I be alive ?I think you know said Dumbledore .Think back .Remember what he did in his ignorance in his greed and his cruelty .Harry thought .He let his gaze drift over his surroundings .If it was indeed a palace in which they sat it was an odd one with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there and still he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there .Then the answer rose to his lips easily without effort .He took my blood said Harry .Precisely !said Dumbledore .He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it !Your blood in his veins Harry Lilys protection inside both of you !He tethered you to life while he lives !I live .while he lives ?But I thought .I thought it was the other way round !I thought we both had to die ?Or is it the same thing ?He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again .Are you sure we cant do anything ?There is no help possible .Then explain .more said Harry and Dumbledore smiled .You were the seventh Horcrux Harry the Horcrux he never meant to make .He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil the murder of your parents the attempted killing of a child .But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew .He left more than his body behind .He left part of himself latched to you the wouldbe victim who had survived .And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete Harry !That which Voldemort does not value he takes no trouble to comprehend .Of houseelves and childrens tales of love loyalty and innocence Voldemort knows and understands nothing .Nothing .That they all have a power beyond his own a power beyond the reach of any magic is a truth he has never grasped .He took your blood believing it would strengthen him .He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you .His body keeps her sacrifice alive and while that enchantment survives so do you and so does Voldemorts one last hope for himself .Dumbledore smiled at Harry and Harry stared at him .And you knew this ?You knew all along ?I guessed .But my guesses have usually been good said Dumbledore happily and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble .Theres more said Harry .Theres more to it .Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed ?As to that I cannot be sure .Have a guess then said Harry and Dumbledore laughed .What you must understand Harry is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested .But here is what I think happened and it is unprecedented and no wandmaker could I think ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort .Without meaning to as you now know Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form .A part of his soul was still attached to yours and thinking to strengthen himself he took a part of your mothers sacrifice into himself .If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice he would not perhaps have dared to touch your blood .But then if he had been able to understand he could not be Lord Voldemort and might never have murdered at all .Having ensured this twofold connection having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours .And now something very strange happened as we know .The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort who never knew that your wand was twin of his had never expected .He was more afraid than you were that night Harry .You had accepted even embraced the possibility of death something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do .Your courage won your wand overpowered his .And in doing so something happened between those wands something that echoed the relationship between their masters .I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemorts wand that night which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself .So your wand recognized him when he pursued you recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him magic much more powerful than anything Luciuss wand had ever performed .Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemorts own deadly skill What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoys stand ?But if my wand was so powerful how come Hermione was able to break it ?asked Harry .My dear boy its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort who had tampered so illadvisedly with the deepest laws of magic .Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful .Otherwise it was a wand like any other .though a good one I am sure Dumbledore finished kindly .Harry sat in thought for a long time or perhaps seconds .It was very hard to be sure of things like time here .He killed me with your wand .He failed to kill you with my wand Dumbledore corrected Harry .I think we can agree that you are not dead though of course he added as if fearing he had been discourteous I do not minimize your sufferings which I am sure were severe .I feel great at the moment though said Harry looking down at his clean unblemished hands .Where are we exactly ?Well I was going to ask you that said Dumbledore looking around .Where would you say that we are ?Until Dumbledore had asked Harry had not known .Now however he found that he had an answer ready to give .It looks he said slowly like Kings Cross station .Except a lot cleaner and empty and there are no trains as far as I can see .Kings Cross station !Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately .Good gracious really ?Well where do you think we are ?asked Harry a little defensively .My dear boy I have no idea .This is as they say your party .Harry had no idea what this meant Dumbledore was being infuriating .He glared at him then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location .The Deathly Hallows he said and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledores face .Ah yes he said .He even looked a little worried .Well ?For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore he looked less than an old man much less .He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing .Can you forgive me ?he said .Can you forgive me for not trusting you ?For not telling you ?Harry I only feared that you would fail as I had failed .I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes .I crave your pardon Harry .I have known for some time now that you are the better man .What are you talking about ?asked Harry startled by Dumbledores tone by the sudden tears in his eyes .The Hallows the Hallows murmured Dumbledore .A desperate mans dream !But theyre real !Real and dangerous and a lure for fools said Dumbledore .And I was such a fool .But you know dont you ?I have no secrets from you anymore .You know .What do I know ?Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes .Master of death Harry master of Death !Was I better ultimately than Voldemort ?Of course you were said Harry .Of course how can you ask that ?You never killed if you could avoid it !True true said Dumbledore and he was like a child seeking reassurance .Yet I too sought a way to conquer death Harry .Not the way he did said Harry .After all his anger at Dumbledore how odd it was to sit here beneath the high vaulted ceiling and defend Dumbledore from himself .Hallows not Horcruxes .Hallows murmured Dumbledore not Horcruxes .Precisely .There was a pause .The creature behind them whimpered but Harry no longer looked around .Grindelwald was looking for them too ?he asked .Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded .It was the thing above all that drew us together he said quietly .Two clever arrogant boys with a shared obsession .He wanted to come to Godrics Hollow as I am sure you have guessed because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell .He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died .So its true ?asked Harry .All of it ?The Peverell brothers were the three brothers of the tale said Dumbledore nodding .Oh yes I think so .Whether they met Death on a lonely road .I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects .The story of them being Deaths own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations .The Cloak as you know now traveled down through the ages father to son mother to daughter right down to Ignotuss last living descendant who was born as Ignotus was in the village of Godrics Hollow .Dumbledore smiled at Harry .Me ?You .You have guessed I know why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died .James had showed it to me just a few days previously .It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school !I could hardly believe what I was seeing .I asked to borrow it to examine it .I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows but I could not resist could not help taking a closer look .It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen immensely old perfect in every respect .and then your father died and I had two Hallows at last all to myself !His tone was unbearably bitter .The Cloak wouldnt have helped them survive though Harry said quickly .Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were .The Cloak couldnt have made them curseproof .True sighed Dumbledore .True .Harry waited but Dumbledore did not speak so he prompted him .So youd given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak ?Oh yes said Dumbledore faintly .It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harrys eyes .You know what happened .You know .You cannot despise me more than I despise myself .But I dont despise you Then you should said Dumbledore .He drew a deep breath .You know the secret of my sisters ill health what those Muggles did what she became .You know how my poor father sought revenge and paid the price died in Azkaban .You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana .I resented it Harry .Dumbledore stated it baldly coldly .He was looking now over the top of Harrys head into the distance .I was gifted I was brilliant .I wanted to escape .I wanted to shine .I wanted glory .Do not misunderstand me he said and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again .I loved them .I loved my parents I loved my brother and my sister but I was selfish Harry more selfish than you who are a remarkably selfless person could possibly imagine .So that when my mother died and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother I returned to my village in anger and bitterness .Trapped and wasted I thought !And then of course he came .Dumbledore looked directly into Harrys eyes again .Grindelwald .You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me Harry inflamed me .Muggles forced into subservience .We wizards triumphant .Grindelwald and I the glorious young leaders of the revolution .Oh I had a few scruples .I assuaged my conscience with empty words .It would all be for the greater good and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards .Did I know in my heart of hearts what Gellert Grindelwald was ?I think I did but I closed my eyes .If the plans we were making came to fruition all my dreams would come true .And at the heart of our schemes the Deathly Hallows !How they fascinated him how they fascinated both of us !The unbeatable wand the weapon that would lead us to power !The Resurrection Stone to him though I pretended not to know it it meant an army of Inferi !To me I confess it meant the return of my parents and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders .And the Cloak .somehow we never discussed the Cloak much Harry .Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak the true magic of which of course is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner .I thought that if we ever found it it might be useful in hiding Ariana but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death which we took to mean ‘invincible .Invincible masters of death Grindelwald and Dumbledore !Two months of insanity of cruel dreams and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me .And then .you know what happened .Reality returned in the form of my rough unlettered and infinitely more admirable brother .I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me .I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow .The argument became a fight .Grindelwald lost control .That which I had always sensed in him though I pretended not to now sprang into terrible being .And Ariana .after all my mothers care and caution .lay dead upon the floor .Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest .Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control .Well Grindelwald fled as anyone but I could have predicted .He vanished with his plans for seizing power and his schemes for Muggle torture and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him .He ran while I was left to bury my sister and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief the price of my shame .Years passed .There were rumors about him .They said he had procured a wand of immense power .I meanwhile was offered the post of Minister of Magic not once but several times .Naturally I refused .I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power .But youd have been better much better than Fudge or Scrimgeour !burst out Harry .Would I ?asked Dumbledore heavily .I am not so sure .I had proven as a very young man that power was my weakness and my temptation .It is a curious thing Harry but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it .Those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wear it well .I was safer at Hogwarts .I think I was a good teacher You were the best you are very kind Harry .But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards Grindelwald was raising an army .They say he feared me and perhaps he did but less I think than I feared him .Oh not death said Dumbledore in answer to Harrys questioning look .Not what he could do to me magically .I knew that we were evenly matched perhaps that I was a shade more skillful .It was the truth I feared .You see I never knew which of us in that last horrific fight had actually cast the curse that killed my sister .You may call me cowardly You would be right .Harry I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death not merely through my arrogance and stupidity but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life .I think he knew it I think he knew what frightened me .I delayed meeting him until finally it would have been too shameful to resist any longer .People were dying and he seemed unstoppable and I had to do what I could .Well you know what happened next .I won the duel .I won the wand .Another silence .Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead .He did not want to know and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him .At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry .They sat in silence for a long time and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore .At last he said Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand .He lied you know pretended he had never had it .Dumbledore nodded looking down at his lap tears still glittering on the crooked nose .They say he showed remorse in later years alone in his cell at Nurmengard .I hope that it is true .I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done .Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends .to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . .or maybe from breaking into your tomb ?suggested Harry and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes .After another short pause Harry said You tried to use the Resurrection Stone .Dumbledore nodded .When I discovered it after all those years buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts the Hallow I had craved most of all though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons I lost my head Harry .I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux that the ring was sure to carry a curse .I picked it up and I put it on and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana and my mother and my father and to tell them how very very sorry I was .I was such a fool Harry .After all those years I had learned nothing .I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows I had proved it time and again and here was final proof .Why ?said Harry .It was natural !You wanted to see them again .Whats wrong with that ?Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows Harry .I was fit only to possess the meanest of them the least extraordinary .I was fit to own the Elder Wand and not to boast of it and not to kill with it .I was permitted to tame and to use it because I took it not for gain but to save others from it .But the Cloak I took out of vain curiosity and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you its true owner .The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace rather than to enable my selfsacrifice as you did .You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows .Dumbledore patted Harrys hand and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled he could not help himself .How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now ?Why did you have to make it so difficult ?Dumbledores smile was tremulous .I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up Harry .I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart .I was scared that if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects you might seize the Hallows as I did at the wrong time for the wrong reasons .If you laid hands on them I wanted you to possess them safely .You are the true master of death because the true master does not seek to run away from Death .He accepts that he must die and understands that there are far far worse things in the living world than dying .And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows ?I do not think so because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux .But even if he had known about them Harry I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first .He would not think that he needed the Cloak and as for the stone whom would he want to bring back from the dead ?He fears the dead .He does not love .But you expected him to go after the wand ?I have been sure that he would try ever since your wand beat Voldemorts in the graveyard of Little Hangleton .At first he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill .Once he had kidnapped Ollivander however he discovered the existence of the twin cores .He thought that explained everything .Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours !So Voldemort instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong what gift you possessed that he did not naturally set out to find the one wand that they said would beat any other .For him the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you .He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible .Poor Severus .If you planned your death with Snape you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand didnt you ?I admit that was my intention said Dumbledore but it did not work as I intended did it ?No said Harry .That bit didnt work out .The creature behind them jerked and moaned and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet .The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes like softly falling snow .Ive got to go back havent I ?That is up to you .Ive got a choice ?Oh yes .Dumbledore smiled at him .We are in Kings Cross you say ?I think that if you decided not to go back you would be able to .lets say .board a train .And where would it take me ?On said Dumbledore simply .Silence again .Voldemorts got the Elder Wand .True .Voldemort has the Elder Wand .But you want me to go back ?I think said Dumbledore that if you choose to return there is a chance that he may be finished for good .I cannot promise it .But I know this Harry that you have less to fear from returning here than he does .Harry glanced again at the rawlooking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair .Do not pity the dead Harry .Pity the living and above all those who live without love .By returning you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed fewer families are torn apart .If that seems to you a worthy goal then we say goodbye for the present .Harry nodded and sighed .Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been but it was warm and light and peaceful here and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss .He stood up and Dumbledore did the same and they looked for a long moment into each others faces .Tell me one last thing said Harry .Is this real ?Or has this been happening inside my head ?Dumbledore beamed at him and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harrys ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure .Of course it is happening inside your head Harry but why on earth should that mean that it is not real ?THE FLAW IN THE PLAN He was lying facedown on the ground again .The smell of the forest filled his nostrils .He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek and the hinge of his glasses which had been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple .Every inch of him ached and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an ironclad punch .He did not stir but remained exactly where he had fallen with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping .He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death but instead hurried footsteps whispers and solicitous murmurs filled the air .My Lord .my Lord .It was Bellatrixs voice and she spoke as if to a lover .Harry did not dare open his eyes but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament .He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground .A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there stuffed out of sight .My Lord .That will do said Voldemorts voice .More footsteps Several people were backing away from the same spot .Desperate to see what was happening and why Harry opened his eyes by a millimeter .Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet .Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him returning to the crowd lining the clearing .Bellatrix alone remained behind kneeling beside Voldemort .Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen .The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort who seemed to have fallen to the ground .Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse .Had Voldemort too collapsed ?It seemed like it .And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned .My Lord let me I do not require assistance said Voldemort coldly and though he could not see it Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand .The boy .Is he dead ?There was complete silence in the clearing .Nobody approached Harry but he felt their concentrated gaze it seemed to press him harder into the ground and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch .You said Voldemort and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain .Examine him .Tell me whether he is dead .Harry did not know who had been sent to verify .He could only lie there with his heart thumping traitorously and wait to be examined but at the same time noting small comfort though it was that Voldemort was wary of approaching him that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan .Hands softer than he had been expecting touched Harrys face pulled back an eyelid crept beneath his shirt down to his chest and felt his heart .He could hear the womans fast breathing her long hair tickled his face .He knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs .Is Draco alive ?Is he in the castle ?The whisper was barely audible her lips were an inch from his ear her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers .Yes he breathed back .He felt the hand on his chest contract her nails pierced him .Then it was withdrawn .She had sat up .He is dead !Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers .And now they shouted now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet and through his eyelids Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration .Still feigning death on the ground he understood .Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts and find her son was as part of the conquering army .She no longer cared whether Voldemort won .You see ?screeched Voldemort over the tumult .Harry Potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now !Watch !CrucioV Harry had been expecting it knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemorts victory .He was lifted into the air and it took all his determination to remain limp yet the pain he expected did not come .He was thrown once twice three times into the air His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes but he kept himself floppy and lifeless and when he fell to the ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter .Now said Voldemort we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero .Who shall drag the body ?No Wait There was a fresh outbreak of laughter and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him .You carry him Voldemort said .He will be nice and visible in your arms will he not ?Pick up your little friend Hagrid .And the glasses put on the glasses he must be recognizable Someone slammed Harrys glasses back onto his face with deliberate force but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle .Harry could feel Hagrid s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms and Harry did not dare by movement or word to intimate to Hagrid that all was not yet lost .Move said Voldemort and Hagrid stumbled forward forcing his way through the closegrowing trees back through the forest .Branches caught at Harrys hair and robes but he lay quiescent his mouth lolling open his eyes shut and in the darkness while the Death Eaters crowed all around them and while Hagrid sobbed blindly nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter .The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned .The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground and after a while Harry could tell by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids that the trees were beginning to thin .BANE !Hagrids unexpected bellow nearly forced Harrys eyes open .Happy now are yeh that yeh didn fight yeh cowardly bunch o nags ?Are yeh happy Harry Potters ddead .Hagrid could not continue but broke down in fresh tears .Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass he dared not open his eyes to look .Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind .A little later Harry sensed by a freshening of the air that they had reached the edge of the forest .Stop .Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemorts command because he lurched a little .And now a chill settled over them where they stood and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees .They would not affect him now .The fact of his own survival burned inside him a talisman against them as though his fathers stag kept guardian in his heart .Someone passed close by Harry and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the grounds crashing upon Harrys eardrums .Harry Potter is dead .He was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him .We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone .The battle is won .You have lost half of your fighters .My Death Eaters outnumber you and the Boy Who Lived is finished .There must be no more war .Anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family .Come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared .Your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build together .There was silence in the grounds and from the castle .Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again .Come said Voldemort and Harry heard him move ahead and Hagrid was forced to follow .Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction and saw Voldemort striding in front of them wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders now free of her enchanted cage .But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness .Harry sobbed Hagrid .Oh Harry .Harry .Harry shut his eyes tight again .He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps signs of life from those within .Stop .The Death Eaters came to a halt Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school .He could see even through his closed lids the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall .He waited .Any moment the people for whom he had tried to die would see him lying apparently dead in Hagrid s arms .NO !The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound .He heard another woman laughing nearby and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagalls despair .He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harrys death for themselves .He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him stroking Naginis head with a single white finger .He closed his eyes again .No !iVo !Harry !HARRY !Rons Hermiones and Ginnys voices were worse than McGonagalls Harry wanted nothing more than to call back yet he made himself lie silent and their cries acted like a trigger the crowd of survivors took up the cause screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters until SILENCE !cried Voldemort and there was a bang and a flash of bright light and silence was forced upon them all .It is over !Set him down Hagrid at my feet where he belongs !Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass .You see ?said Voldemort and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay .Harry Potter is dead !Do you understand now deluded ones ?He was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him !He beat you !yelled Ron and the charm broke and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more .He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds said Voldemort and there was relish in his voice for the lie killed while trying to save himself But Voldemort broke off Harry heard a scuffle and a shout then another bang a flash of light and a grunt of pain he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount .Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort Harry saw the figure hit the ground Disarmed Voldemort throwing the challengers wand aside and laughing .And who is this ?he said in his soft snakes hiss .Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost ?Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh .It is Neville Longbottom my Lord !The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble !The son of the Aurors remember ?Ah yes I remember said Voldemort looking down at Neville who was struggling back to his feet unarmed and unprotected standing in the noman s land between the survivors and the Death Eaters .But you are a pureblood arent you my brave boy ?Voldemort asked Neville who stood facing him his empty hands curled in fists .So what if I am ?said Neville loudly .You show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock .You will make a very valuable Death Eater .We need your kind Neville Longbottom .Ill join you when hell freezes over said Neville .Dumbledores Army !he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd whom Voldemorts Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold .Very well said Voldemort and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse .If that is your choice Longbottom we revert to the original plan .On your head he said quietly be it .Still watching through his lashes Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand .Seconds later out of one of the castles shattered windows something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemorts hand .He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled empty and ragged the Sorting Hat .There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School said Voldemort .There will be no more Houses .The emblem shield and colors of my noble ancestor Salazar Slytherin will suffice for everyone .Wont they Neville Longbottom ?He pointed his wand at Neville who grew rigid and still then forced the hat onto Nevilles head so that it slipped down below his eyes .There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle and as one the Death Eaters raised their wands holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay .Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me said Voldemort and with a flick of his wand he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames .Screams split the dawn and Neville was aflame rooted to the spot unable to move and Harry could not bear it He must act And then many things happened at the same moment .They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the outofsight walls and pelted toward the castle uttering loud war cries .At the same time Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled HAGGER !His cry was answered by roars from Voldemorts giants They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake .Then came hooves and the twangs of bows and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters who broke ranks shouting their surprise .Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes swung it over himself and sprang to his feet as Neville moved too .In one swift fluid motion Neville broke free of the BodyBind Curse upon him the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver with a glittering rubied handle The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs and yet it seemed to draw every eye .With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snakes head which spun high into the air gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall and Voldemorts mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear and the snakes body thudded to the ground at his feet Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand .Then over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants Hagrids yell came loudest of all .HARRY !Hagrid shouted .HARRY WHERES HARRY ?Chaos reigned .The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters everyone was fleeing the giants stamping feet and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemorts giants thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle .Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see and they crumpled not knowing what or who had hit them and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd .Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak Harry was buffeted into the entrance hall He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right Harry cast more Shield Charms and Voldemorts wouldbe victims Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott darted past him into the Great Hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it .And now there were more even more people storming up the front steps and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn who was still wearing his emerald pajamas .They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade .The centaurs Bane Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges .The houseelves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers and at their head the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest was Kreacher his bullfrogs voice audible even above this din Fight !Fight !Fight for my Master defender of houseelves !Fight the Dark Lord in the name of brave Regulus !Fight !They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters their tiny faces alive with malice and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers overcome by spells dragging arrows from wounds stabbed in the leg by elves or else simply attempting to escape but swallowed by the oncoming horde .But it was not over yet Harry sped between duelers past struggling prisoners and into the Great Hall .Voldemort was in the center of the battle and he was striking and smiting all within reach .Harry could not get a clear shot but fought his way nearer still invisible and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside .Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwicks hands saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground .He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback Aberforth Stunning Rookwood Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd not even attempting to fight screaming for their son .Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall Slughorn and Kingsley all at once and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him unable to finish him Bellatrix was still fighting too fifty yards away from Voldemort and like her master she dueled three at once Hermione Ginny and Luna all battling their hardest but Bellatrix was equal to them and Harrys attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch He changed course running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways .NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH !Mrs Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran freeing her arms .Bellatrix spun on the spot roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger .OUT OF MY WAY !shouted Mrs Weasley to the three girls and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel .Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasleys wand slashed and twirled and Bellatrix Lestranges smile faltered and became a snarl .Jets of light flew from both wands the floor around the witches feet became hot and cracked both women were fighting to kill .No !Mrs Weasley cried as a few students ran forward trying to come to her aid .Get back !Get back !She is mine !Hundreds of people now lined the walls watching the two fights Voldemort and his three opponents Bellatrix and Molly and Harry stood invisible torn between both wanting to attack and yet to protect unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent .What will happen to your children when Ive killed you ?taunted Bellatrix as mad as her master capering as Mollys curses danced around her .When Mummys gone the same way as Freddie ?You will never touch our children again !screamed Mrs Weasley .Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did .Mollys curse soared beneath Bellatrixs outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest directly over her heart .Bellatrixs gloating smile froze her eyes seemed to bulge For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened and then she toppled and the watching crowd roared and Voldemort screamed .Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion he saw McGonagall Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backward flailing and writhing through the air as Voldemort s fury at the fall of his last best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb .Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley .Protego roared Harry and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last .The yell of shock the cheers the screams on every side of Harry !HES ALIVE !were stifled at once .The crowd was afraid and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other and began at the same moment to circle each other .I dont want anyone else to try to help Harry said loudly and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call .Its got to be like this .Its got to be me .Voldemort hissed .Potter doesnt mean that he said his red eyes wide .That isnt how he works is it ?Who are you going to use as a shield today Potter ?Nobody said Harry simply .There are no more Horcruxes .Its just you and me .Neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good .One of us ?jeered Voldemort and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared a snake that was about to strike .You think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings ?Accident was it when my mother died to save me ?asked Harry .They were still moving sideways both of them in that perfect circle maintaining the same distance from each other and for Harry no face existed but Voldemorts .Accident when I decided to fight in that graveyard ?Accident that I didnt defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again ?Accidents .screamed Voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified and of the hundreds in the Hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two .Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you !You wont be killing anyone else tonight said Harry as they circled and stared into each others eyes green into red .You wont be able to kill any of them ever again .Dont you get it ?I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people But you did not !I meant to and thats what did it .Ive done what my mother did .Theyre protected from you .Havent you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding ?You cant torture them .You cant touch them .You dont learn from your mistakes Riddle do you ?You dare Yes I dare said Harry .I know things you dont know Tom Riddle .I know lots of important things that you dont .Want to hear some before you make another big mistake ?Voldemort did not speak but prowled in a circle and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret .Is it love again ?said Voldemort his snakes face jeering .Dumbledores favorite solution love which he claimed conquered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork ?Love which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach Potter and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse .So what will stop you dying now when I strike ?Just one thing said Harry and still they circled each other wrapped in each other held apart by nothing but the last secret .If it is not love that will save you this time said Voldemort you must believe that you have magic that I do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine ?I believe both said Harry and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face though it was instantly dispelled Voldemort began to laugh and the sound was more frightening than his screams humorless and insane it echoed around the silent Hall .You think you know more magic than I do ?he said .Than I than Lord Voldemort who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of ?Oh he dreamed of it said Harry but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what youve done .You mean he was weak !screamed Voldemort .Too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine !No he was cleverer than you said Harry a better wizard a better man .I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore !You thought you did said Harry but you were wrong .For the first time the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one .Dumbledore is dead Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him unendurable pain .His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle I have seen it Potter and he will not return !Yes Dumbledores dead said Harry calmly but you didnt have him killed .He chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant .What childish dream is this ?said Voldemort but still he did not strike and his red eyes did not waver from Harrys .Severus Snape wasnt yours said Harry .Snape was Dumbledores Dumbledores from the moment you started hunting down my mother .And you never realized it because of the thing you cant understand .You never saw Snape cast a Patronus did you Riddle ?Voldemort did not answer .They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart .Snapes Patronus was a doe said Harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children .You should have realized he said as he saw Voldemorts nostrils flare he asked you to spare her life didnt he ?He desired her that was all sneered Voldemort but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worthier of him Of course he told you that said Harry but he was Dumbledores spy from the moment you threatened her and hes been working against you ever since !Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him !It matters not !shrieked Voldemort who had followed every word with rapt attention but now let out a cackle of mad laughter .It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledores or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path !I crushed them as I crushed your mother Snape s supposed great love Oh but it all makes sense Potter and in ways that you do not understand !Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me !He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand !But I got there ahead of you little boy I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it I understood the truth before you caught up .I killed Severus Snape three hours ago and the Elder Wand the Deathstick the Wand of Destiny is truly mine !Dumbledore s last plan went wrong Harry Potter !Yeah it did said Harry .Youre right .But before you try to kill me Id advise you to think about what youve done .Think and try for some remorse Riddle .What is this ?Of all the things that Harry had said to him beyond any revelation or taunt nothing had shocked Voldemort like this .Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits saw the skin around his eyes whiten .Its your one last chance said Harry its all youve got left .Ive seen what youll be otherwise .Be a man .try .Try for some remorse .You dare ?said Voldemort again .Yes I dare said Harry because Dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on me at all .Its backfired on you Riddle .Voldemorts hand was trembling on the Elder Wand and Harry gripped Dracos very tightly .The moment he knew was seconds away .That wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person .Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand .He never defeated Dumbledore .He killed Arent you listening ?Snape never beat Dumbledorel Dumbledores death was planned between them !Dumbledore intended to die undefeated the wands last true master !If all had gone as planned the wands power would have died with him because it had never been won from him !But then Potter Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand !Voldemorts voice shook with malicious pleasure .I stole the wand from its last masters tomb !I removed it against its last masters wishes !Its power is mine !You still dont get it Riddle do you ?Possessing the wand isnt enough !Holding it using it doesnt make it really yours .Didnt you listen to Ollivander ?The wand chooses the wizard .The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it .The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance .Voldemorts chest rose and fell rapidly and Harry could feel the curse coming feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face .The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy .Blank shock showed in Voldemorts face for a moment but then it was gone .But what does it matter ?he said softly .Even if you are right Potter it makes no difference to you and me .You no longer have the phoenix wand We duel on skill alone .and after I have killed you I can attend to Draco Malfoy .But youre too late said Harry .Youve missed your chance .I got there first .I overpowered Draco weeks ago .I took this wand from him .Harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it .So it all comes down to this doesnt it ?whispered Harry .Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed ?Because if it does .I am the true master of the Elder Wand .A redgold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window .The light hit both of their faces at the same time so that Voldemorts was suddenly a flaming blur .Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens pointing Dracos wand Avada KedavraV Expelliarmus The bang was like a cannon blast and the golden flames that erupted between them at the dead center of the circle they had been treading marked the point where the spells collided .Harry saw Voldemorts green jet meet his own spell saw the Elder Wand fly high dark against the sunrise spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill who had come to take full possession of it at last .And Harry with the unerring skill of the Seeker caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward arms splayed the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward .Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality his body feeble and shrunken the white hands empty the snakelike face vacant and unknowing .Voldemort was dead killed by his own rebounding curse and Harry stood with two wands in his hand staring down at his enemys shell .One shivering second of silence the shock of the moment suspended and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air .The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione and it was their arms that were wrapped around him their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him .Then Ginny Neville and Luna were there and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting nor tell whose hands were seizing him pulling him trying to hug some part of him hundreds of them pressing in all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived the reason it was over at last The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts and the Great Hall blazed with life and light .Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning of grief and celebration .They wanted him there with them their leader and symbol their savior and their guide and that he had not slept that he craved the company of only a few of them seemed to occur to no one .He must speak to the bereaved clasp their hands witness their tears receive their thanks hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic .They moved Voldemorts body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall away from the bodies of Fred Tonks Lupin Colin Creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him .McGonagall had replaced the House tables but nobody was sitting according to House anymore All were jumbled together teachers and pupils ghosts and parents centaurs and house elves and Firenze lay recovering in a corner and Grawp peered in through a smashed window and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth .After a while exhausted and drained Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna .Id want some peace and quiet if it were me she said .Id love some he replied .Ill distract them all she said .Use your Cloak .And before he could say a word she had cried Oooh look a Blibbering Humdinger !and pointed out of the window .Everyone who heard looked around and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself and got to his feet .Now he could move through the Hall without interference .He spotted Ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mothers shoulder There would be time to talk later hours and days and maybe years in which to talk .He saw Neville the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers .Along the aisle between the tables he walked and he spotted the three Malfoys huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there but nobody was paying them any attention .Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited and finally he saw the two whose company he craved most .Its me he muttered crouching down between them .Will you come with me ?They stood up at once and together he Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall .Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase part of the balustrade gone and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed .Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition We did it we bashed them wee Potters the one And Voldys gone moldy so now lets have fun !Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesnt it ?said Ron pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through .Happiness would come Harry thought but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps .Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief and a longing to sleep .But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione who had stuck with him for so long and who deserved the truth .Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking though none of them had mentioned their destination .Since he had last seen it the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmasters study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided looking a little punchdrunk and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore .Can we go up ?he asked the gargoyle .Feel free groaned the statue .They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator .Harry pushed open the door at the top .He had one brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort But it was applause .All around the walls the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs they reached through their frames to grip each others hands they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly Dexter Fortescue was waving his eartrumpet and Phineas Nigellus called in his high reedy voice And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part !Let our contribution not be forgotten !But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmasters chair .Tears were sliding down from behind the half moon spectacles into the long silver beard and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song .At last Harry held up his hands and the portraits fell respectfully silent beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak .He directed his words at Dumbledore however and chose them with enormous care .Exhausted and blearyeyed though he was he must make one last effort seeking one last piece of advice .The thing that was hidden in the Snitch he began I dropped it in the forest .I dont know exactly where but Im not going to go looking for it again .Do you agree ?My dear boy I do said Dumbledore while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious .A wise and courageous decision but no less than I would have expected of you .Does anyone else know where it fell ?No one said Harry and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction .Im going to keep Ignotuss present though said Harry and Dumbledore beamed .But of course Harry it is yours forever until you pass it on !And then theres this .Harry held up the Elder Wand and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that even in his befuddled and sleepdeprived state Harry did not like to see .I dont want it said Harry .What ?said Ron loudly .Are you mental ?I know its powerful said Harry wearily .But I was happier with mine .So .He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather .Hermione had said that they could not be repaired that the damage was too severe .All he knew was that if this did not work nothing would .He laid the broken wand upon the headmasters desk touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand and said Reparo .As his wand resealed red sparks flew out of its end .Harry knew that he had succeeded .He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion .Im putting the Elder Wand he told Dumbledore who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration back where it came from .It can stay there .If I die a natural death like Ignotus its power will be broken wont it ?The previous master will never have been defeated .Thatll be the end of it .Dumbledore nodded .They smiled at each other .Are you sure ?said Ron .There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand .I think Harrys right said Hermione quietly .That wands more trouble than its worth said Harry .And quite honestly he turned away from the painted portraits thinking now only of the fourposter bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there Ive had enough trouble for a lifetime .ayue NINETEEN YEARS LATER Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year .The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air .Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing the owls inside them hooted indignantly and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers clutching her fathers arm .It wont be long and youll be going too Harry told her .Two years sniffed Lily .I want to go now The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten .Albuss voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car .I wonti I wont be in Slytherin !James give it a rest !said Ginny .I only said he might be said James grinning at his younger brother .Theres nothing wrong with that .He might be in Slyth But James caught his mothers eye and fell silent .The five Potters approached the barrier .With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run .A moment later he had vanished .Youll write to me wont you ?Albus asked his parents immediately capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother .Every day if you want us to said Ginny .Not every day said Albus quickly .James says most people only get letters from home about once a month .We wrote to James three times a week last year said Ginny .And you dont want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts Harry put in .He likes a laugh your brother .Side by side they pushed the second trolley forward gathering speed .As they reached the barrier Albus winced but no collision came .Instead the family emerged onto platform nine and threequarters which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express .Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist into which James had already disappeared .Where are they ?asked Albus anxiously peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform .Well find them said Ginny reassuringly .But the vapor was dense and it was difficult to make out anybodys faces .Detached from their owners voices sounded unnaturally loud .Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello .I think thats them Al said Ginny suddenly .A group of four people emerged from the mist standing alongside the very last carriage .Their faces only came into focus when Harry Ginny Lily and Albus had drawn right up to them .Hi said Albus sounding immensely relieved .Rose who was already wearing her brandnew Hogwarts robes beamed at him .Parked all right then ?Ron asked Harry .I did .Hermione didnt believe I could pass a Muggle driving test did you ?She thought Id have to Confund the examiner .No I didnt said Hermione I had complete faith in you .As a matter of fact I did Confund him Ron whispered to Harry as together they lifted Albus s trunk and owl onto the train .I only forgot to look in the wing mirror and lets face it I can use a Supersensory Charm for that .Back on the platform they found Lily and Hugo Roses younger brother having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts .If youre not in Gryffindor well disinherit you said Ron but no pressure .Ron Lily and Hugo laughed but Albus and Rose looked solemn .He doesnt mean it said Hermione and Ginny but Ron was no longer paying attention .Catching Harrys eye he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away .The steam had thinned for a moment and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist .Look who it is .Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son a dark coat buttoned up to his throat .His hair was receding somewhat which emphasized the pointed chin .The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry .Draco caught sight of Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny staring at him nodded curtly and turned away again .So thats little Scorpius said Ron under his breath .Make sure you beat him in every test Rosie .Thank God you inherited your mothers brains .Ron for heavens sake said Hermione half stern half amused .Dont try to turn them against each other before theyve even started school !Youre right sorry said Ron but unable to help himself he added Dont get too friendly with him though Rosie .Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood .Hey !James had reappeared he had divested himself of his trunk owl and trolley and was evidently bursting with news .Teddys back there he said breathlessly pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam .Just seen him !And guess what hes doing ?Snogging Victoire He gazed up at the adults evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction .Our Teddy !Teddy Lupin Snogging our Victoire !Our cousin !And I asked Teddy what he was doing You interrupted them ?said Ginny .You are so like Ron and he said hed come to see her off !And then he told me to go away .Hes snogging her !James added as though worried he had not made himself clear .Oh it would be lovely if they got married !whispered Lily ecstatically .Teddy would really be part of the family then !He already comes round for dinner about four times a week said Harry .Why dont we just invite him to live with us and have done with it ?Yeah !said James enthusiastically .I dont mind sharing with A1 Teddy could have my room !No said Harry firmly you and A1 will share a room only when I want the house demolished .He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewetts .Its nearly eleven youd better get on board .Dont forget to give Neville our love !Ginny told James as she hugged him .Mum !I cant give a professor love But you know Neville James rolled his eyes .Outside yeah but at school hes Professor Longbottom isnt he ?I cant walk into Herbology and give him love .Shaking his head at his mothers foolishness he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus .See you later Al .Watch out for the thestrals .I thought they were invisible ?You said they were invisible !But James merely laughed permitted his mother to kiss him gave his father a fleeting hug then leapt onto the rapidly filling train .They saw him wave then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends .Thestrals are nothing to worry about Harry told Albus .Theyre gentle things theres nothing scary about them .Anyway you wont be going up to school in the carriages youll be going in the boats .Ginny kissed Albus goodbye .See you at Christmas .Bye Al said Harry as his son hugged him .Dont forget Hagrids invited you to tea next Friday .Dont mess with Peeves .Dont duel anyone till youve learned how .And dont let James wind you up .What if Im in Slytherin ?The whisper was for his father alone and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was .Harry crouched down so that Albus s face was slightly above his own .Alone of Harrys three children Albus had inherited Lilys eyes .Albus Severus Harry said quietly so that nobody but Ginny could hear and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose who was now on the train you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts .One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew .But just say then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student wont it ?It doesnt matter to us Al .But if it matters to you youll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin .The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account .Really ?It did for me said Harry .He had never told any of his children that before and he saw the wonder in Albuss face when he said it .But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses lastminute reminders .Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him .Students were hanging from the windows nearest them .A great number of faces both on the train and off seemed to be turned toward Harry .Why are they all staring ?demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students .Dont let it worry you said Ron .Its me .Im extremely famous .Albus Rose Hugo and Lily laughed .The train began to move and Harry walked alongside it watching his sons thin face already ablaze with excitement .Harry kept smiling and waving even though it was like a little bereavement watching his son glide away from him .The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air .The train rounded a corner .Harrys hand was still raised in farewell .Hell be all right murmured Ginny .As Harry looked at her he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his
